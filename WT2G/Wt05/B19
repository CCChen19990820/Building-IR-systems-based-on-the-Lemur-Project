<P><B>Principal Points of Disagreement</B>
</P>
<P>1.4 The assertions made in the Objectors' proofs, and which form the
principal points of disagreement, fall essentially into three categories:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and hence there is
no need for the RCF;

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the RCF will not take us significantly forward; and

<TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD>iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">an application to construct an RCF at Sellafield is premature.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.5 These three categories of issues are briefly reviewed in turn in the
following paragraphs, the reasons why I disagree with the Objectors are stated
and indications are given as to where the individual points of disagreement are
addressed in the body of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'Sellafield is a poor site'</B>
</P>
<P>1.6 The assertions by the Objectors that Sellafield is a 'poor' site take a
number of forms, which are summarised as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>There are 'better' sites elsewhere in UK at which
further investigations should be concentrated.</B></U>This is a major assertion
by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site is complex.</B></U>Professor Mather 
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7), Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1) and Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.14), assert that the site is so complex and unpredictable
that it will never be possible to adequately characterise it.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.7 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly
believe that the results so far of the investigations and studies indicate that
the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:
</P>

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the results of the investigations carried out so far have

<TD WIDTH="800">ssessments of the likely performance of the total repository,

provide confidence that a repository could be developed at Sellafield which
would meet regulatory requirements.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.8 The Objectors' assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' site are based on
three flawed approaches, as follows:

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the inappropriate use of geological and hydrogeological
'criteria'</B></U>for the assessment of site suitability.  As set out in
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.26">paragraph 6.26</A> of <B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>,
Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and qualitative
hydrogeological 'criteria' (for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3,
paragraph 12.5);

6.2.9 and PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5), interpretation of salinity profiles
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.7.1) and patterns of groundwater flow (PE/CCC/4,
paragraph 6.6.5; PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 8.1 to 8.4))
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>'The RCF will not take us forward'</B>
</P>
<P>1.9 There are two main themes within the Objectors' evidence that can be
grouped under this general heading, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide sufficient information</B></U>to
establish whether the site will prove suitable for a repository because it is
impossible ever to characterise a complex site to the extent required (for
example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7; PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/7, paragraph
4.14); and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide important information</B></U>(for
example, on the regional hydrogeology PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2) needed to assess
the suitability of the site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.10 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeneity, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art geostatistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of Information</U>
</P>
<P>1.11 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>1.12 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>Further work is required before an RCF is constructed.</B></U>Dr
Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 5.6, 9.8, 14.1, 14.22 and 16.6), Drs Green and
Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraphs 9.7 and 10.5), Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3,
paragraphs 7.9, 8.7, 9.10, 10.3 and 10.8), Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5),
Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraphs 5.5 and 6.1-6.6), Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 6.20, 10.8, 11.8 and 12.3) and Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.43
and 6.20) all assert to varying extents, that additional work needs to be
undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise ultimately to justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The hydrogeological baseline conditions have not been
established.</B></U>This argument (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5; PE/FOE/5, paragraph
5.5) is used to assert that additional periods of monitoring are required of 4
or 5 years to establish baseline and therefore, that the RCF is premature.  The
subject of baseline is addressed in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> and in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>1.13 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an
integrated programme of site characterisation activities.  Thus further
surface-based investigations, laboratory tests, interpretation and modelling are
being undertaken in parallel with the RCF (see <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Those investigations which are required before the
RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P>1.14 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has
been confirmed by a review undertaken for Nirex by Professor Lloyd (Professor of
Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham) [NRX/14/3].  A further two years of
monitoring will be undertaken before RCF construction commences.

<P>1.15 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4, page 5) states that there
are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of Nirex Report 71 (<I>PERA</I>) [COR/501].
</P>
<P>1.16 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) seeks to make a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>1.17 The issue of geological criteria is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraphs 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).  As indicated there, the
suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety assessment of the
predicted performance of the complete repository system of the site, not on
criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P>1.18 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he asserts that:

<P>1.21 These are the characteristics of the environments described by
Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P>1.22 I disagree with the approach taken by Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in
seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield with secondary qualitative criteria
set up to assist is identifying suitable generic sites for investigation.  The
appropriate basis for assessing the suitability of a site that has been
investigated is by carrying out safety assessment studies and comparing the
results with regulatory requirements.  Nirex has presented a preliminary
assessment for the groundwater pathway at Sellafield in  Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of a BUSC site
described at paragraph 6.3.3 in Nirex Report 71 [COR/501] and of the examples
given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><U>Alternative Sites</U>
</P>
<P>1.23 Professor Mather makes a number of statements about Sellafield and
possible alternative sites in paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4).
 In particular he asserts that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central
England are likely to be far less complex than the BVG.  I am not aware of any
evidence to support this view, and he refers to none.
</P>
<P>1.24 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.6, PE/CCC/4) point it is acknowledged that there could be other
sites that would offer lower levels of post-closure radiological risk to an
individual, but the pursuit of risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is
not a requirement of government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's
supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraphs 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.
</P>
<P>1.25 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 16.10, PE/GNP/3), Mr Reeves (paragraphs 2.2,
3.2, 4.4 and 8.7, PE/FOE/4), and Dr Allison ( paragraph 4.17, PE/FOE/7) all
state their view that alternative, unspecified sites should be investigated.  No
evidence, other than their assertions that Sellafield is a 'poor' or 'marginal'
site, is presented by them to support the investigation of these unspecified
alternative sites.
</P>
<P><U>Complexity</U>
</P>
<P>1.26 Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, for example paragraph 8.6), Dr Kokelaar
(paragraphs 3.3, 4.1 and 5.1; PE/FOE/2), Dr Allison (paragraph 4.14; PE/FOE/7)
and Dr Salmon (paragraph 2.8, PE/FOE/5) make repeated claims that the Sellafield
site is complex.  Complexity is something that must be addressed in a safety
assessment and which influences the design of the investigation programme and
modelling approach, it is not a disqualifier of a site.  Natural complexity has
been addressed in an appropriate way by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Geology</U>
</P>
<P>1.27 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/2) that the BVG has
exceptional geological complexity that renders prediction of the 3-D
distribution of the rocks and fractures extremely difficult.  His evidence
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>1.28 Professor Smythe, by selectively presenting information, has sought to
undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order to justify
the need for a 3-D seismic survey (paragraphs 10.2 and 10.8; PE/FOE/3).  Not
only is it considered that the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the
interpretations of the structural geology are unjustified, but he has also
failed to appreciate that the evidence presented by Nirex already includes
proposals to carry out such a survey prior to the commencement of RCF
construction.
</P>
<P><U>Groundwater flow through fractured rock</U>
</P>
<P>1.29 Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine have asserted that only a single
fracture in the rock could render the site unsuitable and, by applying
inappropriate secondary hydrogeological 'criteria' have sought to demonstrate
that the Sellafield site is unsuitable (paragraph 6.29, PE/CCC/4; paragraph
12.5, PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>1.30 They  have used an inappropriate basis for relating small scale
measurements in boreholes to the large scale characteristics of the rock mass as
a whole in order to represent the site in a way that is incompatible with large
scale measurements made at the site.
</P>
<P>1.31 Dr Haszeldine has reported some alternative groundwater flow modelling
and sought to demonstrate that it indicates results which are significantly
different from those reported by Nirex (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 7.27).
</P>
<P>On the basis of a review of the modelling work undertaken by Dr Haszeldine
it is concluded that the differences he reports between his modelling and that
undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:

<P>1.33 It is my assessment that if realistic parameters were used, Dr
Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These results indicate that
the site is likely to meet the regulatory safety requirements.

reason why the RCF should not proceed to provide the necessary information to
allow Nirex to decide whether to proceed with a planning application for a

necessary, these can be completed before the programmed date for commencement of

<P><U>Comparison with investigation practices elsewhere</U>
</P>
<P>1.45 Dr Haszeldine and Professor Smythe seek to draw comparisons between the
Nirex investigations and the practices in the oil industry to seek to
demonstrate that the approach and timescales adopted by Nirex are inappropriate
(PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14 and PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>1.46 The programme presented by Dr Haszeldine for the Nirex investigations
is wrong and understates the duration of the Nirex scientific programme.  The
duration of the Nirex investigations is longer than he quotes for investigations
in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>1.47 The investigation practices adopted by Nirex and the oil industry are
substantially similar, the differences reflecting that Nirex is assessing the
suitability of a site for a radioactive waste repository and not exploring for
oil or gas.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusions</U>
</P>
<P>1.48 My supplementary proof has demonstrated the inappropriate use by the
Objectors of geological and hydrogeological 'criteria' in an attempt to suggest
that the Sellafield site has little potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.49 The results of the investigations carried out by Nirex have been
translated through the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] into assessments of risk that
can be compared with regulatory safety requirements.  These studies indicate
that the site has good potential as a repository site.
</P>
<P>1.50 I have indicated that those surface-based investigations which are
relevant to the assessment of the site to host a repository are planned or are
programmed by Nirex either to be completed prior to commencement of the RCF,
where necessary or appropriate, or to proceed in parallel with the RCF where
this is appropriate.
</P>
<P>1.51 Baseline hydrogeological conditions have been established and a further
two years of monitoring will be completed before commencement of RCF shaft
sinking.  There is no justification for the duration of monitoring claimed, by
the Objectors, as being required before the RCF commences.

<P><B>Principal Points of Disagreement</B>
</P>
<P>2.3 The assertions made in the Objectors' proofs, and which form the
principal points of disagreement, fall essentially into three categories:

<P>2.4 These three categories of issues are briefly reviewed in turn in the

and indications are given as to where the individual points of disagreement are
addressed in the body of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'Sellafield is a poor site'</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.5"></A>2.5 The assertions by the Objectors that Sellafield
is a 'poor' site take a number of forms, which are summarised as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The site does not conform to generic characteristics of
a potential repository site.</B></U>This is the assertion made primarily by
Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1).  He asserts that there are a number
of 'requirements' for a potential repository site and that the Sellafield site,
by not matching up to these 'requirements', should be regarded as a 'poor' site
and abandoned.  Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) makes similar assertions (paragraph 2.21,
page 17).  This point is dealt with in section 3 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>There are 'better' sites elsewhere in UK at which
further investigations should be concentrated.</B></U>This is a major assertion
by Professor Mather (PE/CCC/4, paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7) which follows from his
earlier assertion that Sellafield is a 'poor' site and should be abandoned. 
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, because they adopt the position that
further investigations are required at Sellafield before construction of an RCF,
only refer in passing to the possibility that there may be 'better' sites
elsewhere.  Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraph 16.10) suggests that alternative
sites be considered and investigated.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraphs 2.2, 3.2,
4.4 and 8.7) asserts that other sites in the UK should be investigated to
provide a basis for selection of the optimal disposal site.  Dr Allison
(PE/FOE/7, paragraph 4.17) also asserts that alternative sites should be
investigated.  This point is dealt with in sections 4 and 5 of this
supplementary proof.

(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7), Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1) and Dr Allison

that it will never be possible to characterise it adequately.  This point is
dealt with in section 5 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.6 I disagree that Sellafield is a 'poor' site for a repository and firmly
believe that the results so far of the investigations and studies indicate that
the site shows good potential as a repository site.  I believe this because:

<P>2.7 The Objectors' arguments that Sellafield is a 'poor' site are based on

Nirex's view is that the suitability of any particular site must be based on a
safety assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system
at that site.  Such an approach is not followed by the Objectors in asserting
that Sellafield is a 'poor' site based upon both qualitative 'criteria' which
were intended to assist in the early stages of area selection (for example
PE/CCC/4, paragraph 3.1; PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.4) and hydrogeological 'criteria'
(for example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.2.9; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5);

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><B>'The RCF will not take us forward'</B>
</P>
<P>2.8 There are two main themes within the Objectors' evidence that can be
grouped under this general heading, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide sufficient information</B></U>
to establish whether the site will prove suitable for a repository because it is
impossible ever to characterise a complex site to the extent required (for
example PE/CCC/4, paragraph 5.7; PE/FOE/2, paragraph 5.1; PE/FOE/7, paragraph
4.14); and

<TR>

<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>the RCF will not provide important information</B></U>
(for example, on the regional hydrogeology, PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2) needed to
assess the suitability of the site.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Sufficiency of Information</U>
</P>
<P>2.9 I disagree with the first theme on the grounds of a fundamental
difference in the apparent approach of the Objectors and Nirex as to how to
treat spatial variability (heterogeniety, or 'complexity') in constructing
groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models.  Whilst the Objectors
appear, on the whole, to expect precise deterministic characterisation of the
whole flow system to be necessary to build an adequate model, Nirex is adopting
state-of-the-art statistical techniques which use a stochastic description of
the flow system built on a limited programme of observations and experiments. 
The Nirex approach is held in common with most organisations concerned with
evaluating flow and transport in heterogeneous systems.  This is discussed in
detail in section 5 of this proof.
</P>
<P><U>Importance of information</U>
</P>
<P>2.10 A particular issue raised by the Objectors is that the RCF will not
provide information on issues of importance to the establishment of the
potential of the site to host a repository.  For example, the extent to which
the RCF will provide information on the regional hydrogeology has been
questioned (PE/CCC/4, paragraph 7.2).  I do not agree with this assertion and
state my reasons in <A HREF="#Para8.79">paragraphs 8.79</A> to 8.88 of this
supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><B>'The RCF is Premature'</B>
</P>
<P>2.11 A consistent theme within the Objectors' evidence is that the RCF is
premature.  Two main assertions are made, namely:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>Further work is required before an RCF is constructed.</B></U>
 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3, paragraphs 5.6, 9.8, 14.1, 14.22 and 16.6), Drs Green
and Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraphs 9.7 and 10.5), Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3,
paragraphs 7.9, 8.7, 9.10, 10.3 and 10.8), Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5),
Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5, paragraphs 5.5 and 6.1-6.6), Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6,
paragraphs 6.20, 10.8, 11.8 and 12.3) and Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7, paragraphs 4.43
and 6.20) all assert to varying extents, that additional work needs to be
undertaken before construction of an RCF at Sellafield should commence.  In
asserting that additional work is required to characterise the site prior to
construction of an RCF, the Objectors are presumably conceding that the site may
hold sufficient promise to ultimately justify construction of an RCF and hence,
hold potential as a repository site.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800"><U><B>The hydrogeological baseline conditions have not been

5.5) is used to assert that additional periods of monitoring are required of 4
or 5 years to establish baseline and therefore, that the RCF is premature.  The
subject of baseline is addressed in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix 2</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> and in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>2.12 The RCF is an important part, but nonetheless only a part, of an
integrated programme of site characterisation activities.  Thus further
surface-based investigations, laboratory tests, interpretation and modelling are
being undertaken in parallel with the RCF (see <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table
6.3</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Those investigations which are required <U>before</U>
the RCF construction starts have either been carried out, are in progress or are
planned for completion prior to the commencement of the RCF.  There are other
investigations which are located outside the area of influence of the RCF which
can proceed in parallel with the RCF and do not therefore need to be undertaken
before RCF construction commences.  These issues are addressed in  section 8of
this supplementary proof  in paragraphs <A HREF="#Para8.89">8.89</A> to 8.95.
</P>
<P>2.13 I believe that baseline conditions have been established.  This has
been confirmed by a review undertaken for Nirex by Professor Lloyd (Professor of
Hydrogeology at University of Birmingham) [NRX/14/3].  A further two years of
monitoring will be undertaken before RCF construction commences.
</P>
<P>2.14 Sections 3 to 5 provide my response to the three main areas of
disagreement described above in <A HREF="#Para2.5">paragraph 2.5</A>.  The
remaining sections of this supplementary proof (6 to 12) deal with specific
technical points surrounding these main areas and are broken down into topical
areas, as follows:

<P>2.16 This section of my supplementary proof responds to the points made

(PE/GNP/3, paragraph 12.5) concerning the treatment of groundwater flow through
fractured rocks.  Their inappropriate use of hydrogeological 'criteria', their
treatment of 'upscaling' and the alternative groundwater flow modelling reported

REPOSITORY SITE</B></P>
<P><B>Qualitative 'Criteria' - General</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para3.1"></A>3.1 Professor Mather, in paragraph 3.1 (PE/CCC/4,
page 5) states that there are
<I>&quot;requirements of a geological barrier&quot;</I> and lists a series of
characteristics which he states are those listed in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].  In fact, his list is his own interpretation of that
given in paragraphs 3.2.6 and 3.2.7 of  <I>PERA</I>.
</P>
<P>3.2 Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)  makes a similar point in section 2 of his
evidence.  At paragraph 2.4 (page 6) he identifies what he states to be <I>&quot;key
hydrogeological criteria for the assessment of environmental suitability for
radioactive waste disposal&quot;</I>.  He then concludes in paragraph 2.21 (page
17) that <I>&quot;I consider that the Sellafield site does not satisfy at least
two of the hydrogeological criteria previously considered as necessary
pre-requisites for the construction of a deep radioactive waste repository&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>3.3 The issue of geological 'criteria' is addressed at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.24">paragraph 6.24</A> to 6.28 of Mr
Folger's supplementary proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>).   As indicated
there, the suitability of any particular site must be based on a safety
assessment of the predicted performance of the complete repository system at the
site, not on criteria for site performance in relation to particular attributes.
</P>
<P><B>Sellafield as a BUSC Site</B>
</P>
<P>3.4 A similar point arises from sections 3 and 4 of Professor Mather's
evidence (PE/CCC/4) in which he indicates that, &quot;<I>The 'BUSC' concept</I>
[low permeability basement under sedimentary cover]<I> (Figure 1c) was
identified</I>
<I>as</I> <I>providing the best overall performance of land-based options with
respect to post-closure radiological safety</I>&quot;<I> </I>(PE/CCC/4,
paragraph 3.3, page 9), but asserts that the Sellafield site <I>&quot;has none
of the hydrogeological characteristics associated with the BUSC concept&quot;</I>
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 4.4, page 11).
</P>
<P>3.5 Specifically, Professor Mather seeks to cast doubt on the suitability of
the Sellafield site generally by claiming in paragraph 4.4 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The geological situation is markedly different in the Sellafield
'variant', where basement rocks crop out some 2.5 km away from the potential
repository site.  Groundwater recharge to these rocks at outcrop will provide a
driving force for groundwater to flow through the repository volume.  Thus, from
first principles, Sellafield has an inherent flaw in comparison to the original
BUSC concept, with a much greater potential for groundwater circulation within
the basement rocks.  In fact, Sellafield bears no relationship to a BUSC site
nor can it be considered as a 'variant'.  It has none of the hydrogeological
characteristics associated with the BUSC concept, and its designation as a BUSC
'variant' appears to be an attempt to force it to fit one of the hydrogeological
environments defined in Nirex Report No 71 (COR/501).&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.6 The statements made by Professor Mather are contested on three grounds:

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><U>Point 3.6.i</U>
</P>
<P>3.7 In a similar way to that discussed at paragraphs 3.1 and 3.3 above
regarding generic characteristics of repository sites, Professor Mather is
suggesting that comparison between an actual site and qualitative
characteristics of generic sites, in this case the BUSC concept, is an
appropriate method of assessing the suitability of the site.  For the same
reasons as those summarised in  paragraph 3.3 above, Professor Mather's approach
is inappropriate.  Conclusions on the suitability of an actual site must be
based on a safety assessment of the complete repository system at the site.
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 ii</U>
</P>
<P>3.8 In <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex described the geological setting of a
BUSC environment as (paragraph 6.3.3, page 42):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(d) Low Permeability Basement Under Sedimentary Cover (BUSC):
groundwater movement will dominantly occur in the sedimentary cover, with little
anticipated connection to the basement rocks of low intrinsic permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.9 While expressing reservations about inter-relationships between flow
regimes, Professor Mather at paragraph 6.6.7 of PE/CCC/4 appears  implicitly to
accept the overall conceptual model of the Sellafield site in which groundwater
flow is dominantly in the sedimentary cover with an underlying lower
permeability basement through his statement that <I>&quot;It is concluded that
the conceptual model of the hydrogeology proposed by Nirex is a useful
simplification&quot;</I></P>
<P>3.10 That groundwater flow at Sellafield is dominantly occurring in the
sedimentary cover, and there is little anticipated connection to the basement
rocks of low intrinsic permeability are both conclusions in my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraphs 6.70</A> to 6.73 on pages 45-47 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>3.11 The same conclusions are reached from the modelling undertaken in Nirex
95 [COR/522].  In section 2.1.3 on page 2.5 of Volume 3 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The largest groundwater flows are in the Near-Surface Calder
Sandstone and the Near-Surface St Bees Sandstone......There are weak fluxes of
groundwater between these units and the underlying rocks, which have lower
permeability.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para3.12"></A>3.12 Hence, while suitability of a site is not a
question of whether or not it conforms to a particular definition of BUSC, it is
the case that Sellafield demonstrates those characteristics identified with BUSC
in<I> PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><U>Point 3.6 iii</U>
</P>
<P>3.13 In paragraph 3.4 of PE/CCC/4 Professor Mather indicates that the BUSC
concept originates from a paper by Bredehoeft and Maini (CCC/4/1).  Bredehoeft
and Maini do not use the term 'Basement under sedimentary cover' and therefore
do not provide a definition of the term.  In fact there is no widely agreed
definition.  Nirex's view of the key characteristics of the BUSC concept is
given at paragraph 6.3.3 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] as reproduced at paragraph
3.8 above.
</P>
<P>3.14 In paragraph 3.4 CCC/4/1, Professor Mather appears to be incorrect in
describing Bredehoeft and Maini's assessment by stating:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the example they give the cover rocks are shales with a
downward hydraulic gradient isolating groundwater beneath.  This contrasts
markedly with the situation in which the cover rocks are permeable sandstones
used as an aquifer.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.15 Bredehoeft and Maini give two examples, neither of which matches
Professor Mather's description.  The first example of a coastal site is a direct
analogue of the Sellafield situation; the second example is of an inland site
and is similar to Nirex's generic BUSC environment as described in paragraph
6.3.3 of PERA [COR/501].  In both examples, permeable sandstone aquifers are a
component of the cover sequence.

<P><B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>3.18 To summarise, therefore, I disagree with the approach taken by
Professor Mather and Dr Salmon in seeking to compare conditions at Sellafield
with secondary qualitative &quot;criteria&quot; set up to assist in identifying
suitable generic sites for investigation.  The appropriate basis for assessing
the suitability of a site that has been extensively investigated is by carrying
out safety assessment studies and comparing the results with regulatory
requirements.  Nevertheless, Sellafield does demonstrate the characteristics of
a BUSC environment described at paragraph 6.3.3 in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and of
the examples given in the Bredehoeft and Maini paper (CCC/4/1).
</P>
<P><A NAME="Alternative"></A><B>4. ALTERNATIVE SITES</B></P>
<P>4.1 In paragraph 4.6 of his evidence (PE/CCC/4, pages 11 and 13), Professor
Mather describes Sellafield as &quot;<I>inherently less robust</I>&quot; than
the large area of  East Anglia and east-central England identified in <I>PERA</I>
[COR/501] as potentially suitable BUSC rocks.  At paragraph 4.7 he indicates
that, &quot;<I>The Tremadoc rocks in the area of East Central England defined
by Chapman, McEwen and Beale (1986) (COR/614) are likely to be far less complex
that the BVG</I> ....&quot;.
</P>
<P>4.2 In relation to Professor Mather's comparison of the characteristics of
the BVG and the Tremadoc rocks, he does not present any evidence to support his
view that the Tremadoc rocks &quot;<I>are likely to be far less complex than
the BVG</I>&quot; and I am not aware that any such evidence exists.  Since the
compilation of the description of the possible basement geology that underpinned
the work presented in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and COR/614, there has been
extensive interpretation of geophysical surveys over the area, and these have
indicated more variety and complexity in the nature of the basement rocks than
then considered.  There has been very limited deep drilling and this has only
penetrated a few metres into the basement rocks.  It has confirmed their variety
and structural complexity.  Much of this research has been published by the
British Geological Survey and others (see for example,  <I>The contribution of
palaeontological data to an understanding of the early Palaeozoic  framework of
Eastern England </I>[NRX/14/4]).  The main observations are summarised as
follows:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">These rocks comprise mudrocks (mudstones, shales and
siltstones), sandstones, volcanic rocks and igneous intrusives.  The so-called
Tremadoc rocks are the time equivalents of the Skiddaw Group, the volcanic rocks
are, in part, time equivalents of the Borrowdale Group.  Rocks of similar age
and lithology to the Windermere Group have also been proved.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The boreholes are insufficient in number to allow confident
prediction of the likely basement rock at any one point or to map its lithology
in the subsurface.  Published subsurface geological maps of the area are
generalised and conjectural.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iv.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The rocks are folded, and metamorphosed, and in terms of their
fold structure, cleavage, fracture density and the presence of fault-zones and
shear-zones are directly comparable to the similar age Skiddaw, Borrowdale and
Windermere Groups of the Lake District or the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the
Brabant Massif of Belgium.  NRX/14/4 (published in 1991) describes some of the
Tremadoc rocks encountered in the boreholes drilled in the Midlands.  The author
uses phases such as <I>&quot;Dips are steep, between 70&#176; and vertical. 
The Tremadoc strata are folded and faulted, and high proportion of beds are
inverted&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;Dips are steep (60&#176; to vertical) and there
is evidence of slickensiding [the polishing of faults surfaces due to movement]&quot;</I>.

<TD WIDTH="800">Some of the Tremadoc rocks have relatively high organic

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>4.3 It is unlikely, therefore, that the Tremadoc rocks in the area of
east-central England are far less complex than the BVG.
</P>
<P>4.4 More generally, data on the hydrogeological characteristics of deep
basement rocks in the UK are sparse as recognised in a recent report
commissioned from the British Geological Survey by Nirex (<I>Use of a &quot;groundwater
return index&quot; in site selection for deep radioactive waste repositories: a
review of the RWMAC/ACSNI proposal</I> [NRX/14/5]).  The conclusions of this BGS
review include the following statements in section 4 on pages 10 and 11:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;(iii) In application to deep, low permeability formations
potentially suitable for radioactive waste disposal, values of hydrogeological
indices are particularly difficult to estimate because of the scarcity of
reliable data, especially for hydraulic conductivity.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>(iv) Hydraulic conductivity data for such formations are particularly
lacking (in the UK as elsewhere) and subject to particular uncertainty, because
of the difficulties in predicting the influence of faults and other fractures&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In respect of Professor Mather's <I>&quot;inherently less robust&quot;</I>
point it is acknowledged that there could be other sites that would offer lower
levels of post-closure radiological risk to an individual, but the pursuit of
risks below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> design target is not a requirement of
government policy or the regulators (see Mr Folger's supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para6.3">paragraph 6.3</A> to 6.5).  However,
whereas we now have a very substantial base of knowledge  on the characteristics
of the site at Sellafield, knowledge of the alternatives described by Professor
Mather is comparatively sparse.  It cannot be assumed therefore that any
specific alternatives would necessarily be more robust in radiological terms.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Complexity"></A><B>5. COMPLEXITY</B></P>
<P><B>General Considerations</B>
</P>
<P>5.1 Professor Mather makes repeated reference to the complexity of the
Sellafield Site.  For example at paragraph 5.7 on page 16 of PE/CCC/4 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the complex nature of the geology, and particularly the faulting,
makes the controls on groundwater flow much more difficult to define.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.2 Similarly, in his conclusions he again refers to complexity.  In
paragraph 8.6 on page 44 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The distribution of the various rock types in the BVG show the
presence of a complex pile of variably faulted rocks and it is only in a very
limited area that any coherent picture has emerged.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.3 In paragraph 8.8 he states that the conceptual model is simplistic and
hides the complex inter-relationships between the various groundwater regimes. 
Finally, in  paragraph 8.9 he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture
network in the near-field, but because of the complexity and unpredictability of
the hydrogeology, it may not advance the overall understanding of the controls
on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.4 Despite Professor Mather's repeated reference to 'complexity', he
neither defines what he means by complexity, nor does he clearly establish its
significance.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 Dr Allison (PE/FOE/7) at paragraph 4.14, page 20
makes similar statements about the complexity of the Sellafield site.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 A simple definition of 'complexity' is something
that is complicated or difficult to understand.  I believe that any natural
geological system, if investigated in the detail to which Sellafield has been
investigated, would reveal natural complexity at some scales.  The issue is
therefore whether this natural complexity can be understood in sufficient detail
to enable the suitability of the site to be established. A more complex site may
require a more extensive investigation than a less complex site, but providing
the site was capable of being understood, complexity would  be a matter of
resources available for investigation.
</P>
<P>5.7 Paragraph 4.8 of the HMIP background document submitted to the Inquiry
dated 22 September (PE/HMP/1) indicates, <I>&quot;The proposed RCF site has a
complex geological structure and this would need to be addressed thoroughly in
any future application that Nirex might submit under RSA 1993&quot;</I>.  This
suggests that the regulatory view accords with that expressed at
<A HREF="#Para5.6">paragraph 5.6</A> above: that complexity is something to be
addressed, not a disqualifier of a site.
</P>
<P><B>Sufficiency of Information</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 A central difference between the positions of the
Objectors and Nirex in respect of complexity and the appropriate response in
investigation and modelling is that, whilst the Objectors suggest that very
detailed and specific characterisation of rock properties is essential
throughout the system, Nirex, in common with current state-of-the-art practice
in addressing flow and transport in deep groundwater systems, has chosen to
follow a largely stochastic approach.  The arguments which Nirex presents for
adopting this approach develop as follows:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

can be made at various scales of observation and within different regions of the

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Knowledge of all the properties which display variability is
not necessarily important when constructing a safety case as many rock
properties need not be considered directly in safety assessment models.  For
example, very detailed lithological description of the rock may be of minor
significance compared to detailed understanding of fracture characteristics, the
analysis of which is one of the main aims of the RCF.

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">iv.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">Measurements of fracture characteristics are made at various
scales by direct observation and by hydraulic and tracer testing.  This allows
models of their flow and transport properties at those scale to be developed. 
Such models use statistical techniques to simulate the properties of the rock
volume under study and are conditioned by the observations. The models should
have an appropriate level of complexity, sufficient to capture the aspects of
interest in the system without unnecessary detail.  A number of such
'stochastic' techniques exist for producing realisations of fracture fields (or
hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity fields) which replicate the observed
behaviour of the system at the scale at which it is being observed and which may
also be conditioned to duplicate specific point measurements.

<TD WIDTH="800">Such models can be constructed and tested in an RCF at a
variety of scales (1m, 10m, 100m).  The extent to which they are related to each
other provides information on the larger scale variability of the rock formation
being studied.  They can also be used to predict the 'effective' properties of
that rock at a much larger scale ('upscaling').  In the large scale model the
effects of the detailed structure are taken into account implicitly through the
use of appropriate effective properties and the system description is therefore
much simpler.  These models do not represent the details of flow and transport
at the small scale, which do not matter on the scale of interest, but if the
upscaling procedure has been developed correctly, they will predict overall bulk
fluxes through the system as a whole (e.g. at a regional scale).

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">vi.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">It is important to test the models at various scales in order

safety assessment transport calculations) do not depend on some unobserved
variability present at an intermediate scale.  The RCF will allow observations
and testing at a variety of scales.  In addition, some aspects of safety
assessment modelling may require the deployment of relatively small-scale models
to evaluate specific features of the repository design.

are represented explicitly.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>The rationale developed above has been tested in a number of major
programmes in a variety of rock types and at various scales, for example at
Stripa at RCF scale, and at the WIPP site in the USA at 100's km<SUP>2</SUP>
scale.  From the above it can be seen that careful observation and
experimentation at various scales, combined with model building and testing and
a mix of stochastic and deterministic techniques will allow sufficient
information to be gathered to allow an adequate level of site description at the
scales required for safety assessment modelling.
</P>
<P>Finally, I point out that the RCF will not be the only source of information
used to develop and test the flow and transport models discussed.  The programme
of regional investigations will continue in parallel with the RCF and will
provide additional information.

<P><A NAME="Geology"></A><B>6. GEOLOGY</B></P>
<P>6.1 Two of the Objectors' proofs deal primarily with geology and geological
investigations.  These are the proofs by Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor
Smythe (PE/FOE/3).  These proofs are reviewed in turn in the following
paragraphs.
</P>
<P><B>Dr Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2)</B>
</P>
<P>6.2 Dr Kokelaar states his view (paragraph 5.1, page 11, PE/FOE/2) that the
<I>&quot;Borrowdale Volcanic Group has exceptional geological complexity that
renders prediction of its 3D distribution of rocks and fractures extremely
difficult&quot;</I>.  From this he concludes (paragraph 5.2, page 11, PE/FOE/2)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Accurate characterization can only be derived by drilling
boreholes so closely that the drilling would constitute substantial interference
with the system.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.3 He states in paragraph 4.7, page 9 of PE/FOE/2 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Observational data from a sub-surface facility, such as the
proposed RCF, could be obtained directly through observation of the rock exposed
through excavation or indirectly through boreholes drilled from the sub-surface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.4 Dr Kokelaar adds in paragraph 4.8 on page 10 of PE/FOE/2 that access at
depth will not resolve the difficulties associated with the high level of
complexity of the Borrowdale Volcanic System.
</P>
<P>6.5 Thus, Dr Kokelaar appears to be stating a view that the geology of the
BVG cannot be adequately characterised except by closely spaced boreholes.
</P>
<P>6.6 Dr Kokelaar, while having substantial experience of studying volcanic
rocks and the BVG, appears to have used the factual information in a way which
exaggerates the complexities.  The taking of a variety of features of the BVG in
the Lake District and implying that they all apply to the local area of the RCF
and PRZ is misleading.
</P>
<P>6.7 Dr Kokelaar's evidence emphasises the difficulties of obtaining a
completely deterministic description of the geology.  However, he seems not to
have appreciated that such a wholly deterministic description of the geology is
not required in order to be able to develop acceptable models of the site for
assessing the post-closure performance of a repository (see <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P>6.8 In paragraph 3.3 (page 7, PE/FOE/2), Dr Kokelaar makes generalisations
over a large area, states that they apply to the area <I>&quot;in and around
the PRZ&quot;</I>, and applies them indiscriminately, and without justification,
to demonstrate
<I>&quot;extreme 3-D geological complexity&quot;</I></P>
<P>6.9 In the first bullet point of paragraph 3.3 on page 7 (PE/FOE/2), Dr
Kokelaar refers to <I>&quot;substantial primary lateral variations of thickness
and character&quot;</I> of the many constituent rock units.  This generalisation
can be contrasted with the statement made in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.10">paragraphs
5.10</A> and 5.11 of my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) in which I report the
establishment of a subdivision of the BVG <I>&quot;which can be correlated
between boreholes over a distance of several kilometres&quot;</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.10 Dr Kokelaar's second bullet point states that <I>&quot;caldera-forming
gravitational collapse was incremental and haphazard&quot;</I>.  Leaving aside
the issue of whether there is evidence of this on the broad scale, there is
certainly no evidence to demonstrate that the RCF/PRZ area is located near a
caldera margin.
</P>
<P>6.11 Dr Kokelaar's third bullet point refers to soft-state deformation being
far less ordered and hence less predictable that solid-state tectonic
deformation.  Indeed, such structures may be abundant.  However, these
structures are generally healed and are not hydrogeologically significant. 
Hence, there is little to suggest that such features, and their geological
complexity, have any significant influence on the hydrogeological properties of
the rock mass.
</P>
<P>6.12 The statement of fact on faulting which forms the fourth bullet point
is not disputed.  However, the extent to which such faulting affects the
hydrogeology of the site is not addressed at all by Dr Kokelaar.
</P>
<P>6.13 The final bullet point refers to jointing in the BVG.  This has been
described in detail by Nirex.  Again, Dr Kokelaar appears to be assuming that
the description of these features needs to be addressed on a deterministic
basis, rather than the stochastic basis that will inevitably apply to such small
scale fractures (see paragraph 5.8 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><B>Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3)</B>

<P>6.14 The evidence presented by Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) can be summarised
as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ&quot;
</I>(paragraph 10.2. page 50, PE/FOE/3);

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The current geological interpretation is simply not robust, and will

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the 3-D seismic survey should be properly completed or a new
survey undertaken, properly validated, and adequately peer reviewed.  This work
should be undertaken before the hydrogeological modelling work is completed and
before the location for the RCF is finalised.  The results from the 3-D seismic
model and those from the hydrogeological modelling should be demonstrated to be
properly compatible before work on the RCF starts.&quot; </I>(paragraph 10.8,

structures which are likely to be treated deterministically in the
hydrogeological model are robustly defined.  Thus, whilst it is not disputed
that a 3-D seismic survey will probably provide a greater definition of smaller
scale structures within the BVG than is currently available, it is not certain
that such added definition will have any relevance to the hydrogeological
modelling of the site, and hence justify the environmental impact and high cost
of such a survey.

<TD WIDTH="800">Professor Smythe has not appreciated that one of the primary
reasons why Nirex is interested in carrying out a 3-D seismic survey is to
enable the rock properties, not just the geological structure, to be mapped at

<P>6.16 At paragraph 4.6 (page 20, PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The advent of two-dimensional (2-D) seismic imaging, together with
more drilling, has resulted in a radically improved and more detailed, but not
fundamentally different picture of the subsurface.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Professor Smythe then lists a series of data sources and presents a
series of cross sections in his Figure 1.  He appears to have selected these
sections, which are not all from the same transect, to show the greatest
possible differences.  Nevertheless, the sections show that broadly the
subsurface geology has indeed remained fundamentally similar with more
structural detail becoming apparent as additional data have been acquired. 
However, Professor Smythe, having stated in paragraph 4.6 of PE/FOE/3 that the
interpretation has not fundamentally changed, at paragraph 4.8 of PE/FOE/3
states that <I>&quot;the geological interpretation is being substantially
revised every year or so&quot;</I>.  These two statements, in such close
proximity, appear to contradict each other.
</P>
<P>6.18 Professor Smythe has presented a large amount of detail concerning
seismic surveys in his sections 5 to 8 (PE/FOE/3) which appears to be aimed at
undermining the quality of the investigation work and the interpretations
carried out of them.  As such, Professor Smythe's evidence contradicts the
statements made by other independent reviewers (<A
HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para5.5">paragraphs 5.5</A> and 5.6 on pages 15 and 16
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>).
</P>
<P>6.19 At paragraphs 2.13 and 2.18 (PE/FOE/3), Professor Smythe draws
attention to inconsistencies between data sets and interpretations presented by
Nirex and uses this to justify in paragraph 2.18 the need for 3-D seismic
surveys in the Site and even the District areas.  In making these assertions he
has not taken full account of the work on the structure of the PRZ presented in
the summary report {Nirex Report S/95/005} referenced in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para5.9">paragraph 5.9</A> of my evidence (page 21 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
or of the detailed underpinning report on the geological structure of the PRZ
{BGS Technical Report No. WA/95/47C, June 1995} referenced in the summary
report.  The introduction to Report S/95/005 on page 1 includes the following
statements:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;1.2 The general structural and tectonic setting of the area around
Sellafield was reviewed in Nirex Report No. 520.  Nirex Report No. 524, Volume 2
considered the 3D structure of the Region and District.  Since the issue of
those reports many new data have been acquired.  These include the geological
data from the RCF, RCM and PRZ boreholes, and the associated geophysical (VSPs,
cross-hole seismic tomograms, wireline imagery and other wireline log rock mass
property data) and hydrogeological investigations.</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>1.4 A full account of the detailed GIT (Nirex Geological Integration
Team) interpretations underpinning this report is given in BGS Report No.
WA/95/47C.  The interpretation was carried out in two phases; an initial phase
in which individual datasets were interpreted either partially or fully
independently of other data, and a second phase in which the primary data
interpretations were combined to produce an integrated understanding of the
geological structure...&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.20 Thus, by selectively presenting information, Professor Smythe has
sought to undermine the geological interpretations presented by Nirex in order
to justify the need for a 3-D seismic survey.  Not only is it considered that
the claims made by Professor Smythe concerning the interpretations of the
structural geology are unjustified, but he has also failed to appreciate that
the evidence presented by Nirex already includes proposals, subject to the
results of the 3-D trial survey, to carry out such a survey prior to the
commencement of RCF construction.

<P>7.1 Professor Mather states in paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 (PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The results of the hydraulic testing show that 10% of tested zones
in the BVG have hydraulic conductivities two orders of magnitude or more above
the threshold of 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> below which values are
normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  The fact that
the bulk of the BVG has a lower hydraulic conductivity is irrelevant as  only
one hairline crack in a bottle is necessary for all the contents to leak out. 
Depending on how the zones are interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to
which they are subjected, significant groundwater flow is possible.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.2 Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3) at paragraph 12.5 on page 36 seeks to make a
similar point:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I attempted to define a limit to regional BVG permeability, above
which the ultimate Repository should be considered unsafe.  This was arbitrarily
defined as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's
surface within 10,000 yr.  It is extremely important to note that this limit is
not a statistical distribution as currently used by Nirex, but an absolute limit
- if only one fracture has a permeability above this limit, the system is
fundamentally flawed.  It is difficult to imagine how a small RCF can give site
specific measurements of all fractures in the larger region to the required
accuracy and precision.  Thus the RCF cannot act as an adequate site
investigation tool.  I find that the limit to BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP> (3 x 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ma<SUP>-1</SUP>).  This is at least 40
times lower than the maximum permeability measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>

<P>7.4 These issues are dealt with in turn in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P><U>Issue i - Measurements of Hydraulic Conductivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.5 There does not appear to be any disagreement over the hydraulic
conductivity values measured and reported by Nirex.
</P>
<P><U>Issue ii - Hydrogeological 'Criteria'</U>
</P>
<P>7.6 I disagree with the adoption of secondary quantitative criteria for
assessment of the suitability of the site.  This important issue is discussed
further in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iii - Significance of Single Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.7 I disagree with the statements they make about the significance of
single fractures.  These may be relevant if one was looking at thin layers, such
as liners at conventional landfill sites.  They are not, however, relevant to
the Nirex situation in which we are considering the large scale properties of
blocks of rock many hundreds of metres thick through which water must flow. 
This point is made in my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) at
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.16">paragraph 6.16</A>.
</P>
<P><U>Issue iv - Fracture Connectivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.8 I agree with the concept that the behaviour of the rock mass and its
ability to transmit water are controlled by the way the fractures are
interconnected and the hydraulic gradient to which they are subjected.  However,
it does not follow necessarily that significant groundwater flow is possible. 
This would only be the case if there was a well connected system of fractures
with a high hydraulic conductivity.  It is essential to determine the actual
characteristics of the rock mass to determine the extent of the flow.  This is
discussed further at <A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - Adequate Characterisation of Fractures</U>
</P>
<P>7.9 This statement may be true if the requirement was to make
<I>&quot;specific measurement of all fractures in the larger region&quot;</I>. 
This is not the purpose of the RCF.  This was discussed in <A HREF="#Para5.8">paragraphs
5.8</A> to 5.10 above.
</P>
<P><U>Issue vi - Permeability 'Limits'</U>
</P>
<P>7.10 I disagree with this statement for two reasons.  Firstly it is
inappropriate to adopt a secondary quantitative 'criterion' for assessment of
the suitability of the site (see paragraphs <A HREF="#Para3.1">3.1</A> to 3.3
and <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs 7.12</A> to 7.18 below).  Secondly, it is
inappropriate to use point measurements of hydraulic conductivity as the basis
for assessing the large scale hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass.  This is
directly related to Issue iii above and is further discussed at paragraphs
<A HREF="#Para7.19">paragraphs 7.19</A> to 7.27 below.

<P><B>Hydrogeological Criteria</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.12"></A>7.12 Dr Haszeldine in paragraph 12.5 (PE/GNP/3)
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This </I>[regional BVG permeability] <I>was arbitrarily defined
as being unsafe if water flow could return from the PRZ to the earth's surface
within 10,000 yr.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.13 Having arbitrarily (and without justification) adopted this basic
criterion of a 10,000 year return time, Dr Haszeldine then judges the
acceptability of the site by comparing the results he has obtained from his
modelling for his central case and a number of variants calculations with this
criterion.  The variant case considered by Dr Haszeldine based on the adoption
of the modal values for BVG and sandstone hydraulic conductivity produced travel
times of 200,000 years.  The case discussed by Dr Haszeldine in which a 10,000
year travel time was obtained was an extreme case in which the regional
hydraulic conductivity of the BVG was set to the highest measured value (a
factor of 100 times greater than the value used in their other calculations) and
the hydraulic conductivity of the Calder Sandstone was set to a low value.  Data
from Sellafield (Figure 10 on page 17 of Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]) indicates
that the combination of these two extremes is very unlikely (see
<A HREF="#Para7.34">paragraphs 7.34</A> to 7.38 below).
</P>
<P>7.14 Using his 10,000 year criterion, Dr Haszeldine derives an 'acceptable'
upper bound for the hydraulic conductivity for the BVG.  He states in paragraph
12.5 of PE/GNP/3 on page 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I find that the limit of BVG permeability is 1 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  This is at least 40 times lower than the maximum permeability
measured by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.15 His criterion for acceptability is arbitrary (as accepted by Dr
Haszeldine at paragraph 12.5 of PE/GNP/3) and, I would assert, unjustified.
</P>
<P>7.16 Professor Mather also defines, (Paragraph 6.2.9 on page 21 of PE/CCC/4)
a &quot;threshold&quot; value of 10<SUP>-9 </SUP>ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, below which
rocks are normally regarded as impermeable from a waste disposal viewpoint.  He
cites GOV/136, a DoE Waste Management Paper entitled Landfill Design,
Construction and Operational Practice. Among other things, GOV/136 gives
guidance relating to the selection, properties and performance of low
permeability liners that could be installed in landfill facilities.  The
intention is to promote landfill practices that will achieve stabilisation
within one generation (defined as 30 to 50 years). 
</P>
<P>7.17 Given this clarification, it is inappropriate to apply the guidelines
quoted to the long term performance of the geosphere of a radioactive waste
facility.  A more appropriate comparison would be with the performance of the
engineered barriers of the Nirex repository system.  This is predicted to be
significantly in excess of the requirements for low permeability liners
installed in landfill facilities [GOV/136].
</P>
<P>7.18 The likelihood of measured values of permeability (hydraulic
conductivity) greater than 10<SUP>-9</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP> in the basement
rocks was recognised in PERA [COR/501] at Table 8.2.  Whether such values can be
judged as acceptable, or otherwise, can only be made in the context of an
evaluation of the overall post-closure performance assessment of a repository. 
This must include consideration of transport through the geosphere, involving
processes such as dispersion and successive dilution, which contribute to
reducing the release of radionuclides from the geosphere.
</P>
<P><B>Upscaling</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.19"></A>7.19 The derivation of effective parameters is
described in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not a new concept within
the Nirex investigations.  For example, modelling work related to the BVG as a
discrete fracture network was described in some detail in section 6.5 of Volume
3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] in December 1993 (pages 6.26 - 6.35).
</P>
<P>7.20 There are two main ways in which large scale effective parameters can
be determined, both of which have been utilised by Nirex:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by the process of 'upscaling' whereby measurements taken over
small scales are used to infer large scale effective properties.  This is
achieved by Nirex through the use of a range of techniques (page 11, Nirex
Report S/94/004 [COR/510]).  An example is the use of discrete fracture network
modelling techniques in which models are produced which reproduce the
measurements made in small scale borehole tests and in which the models are then
used to estimate large scale effective parameters; and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">by interpretation of measurements of hydrogeological tests that
interrogate a large volume of rock containing the range of natural variability. 
An example of this is the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.41">paragraphs
6.41</A> - 6.45 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  Also, the drawdown experiment in Phase 1 of the RCF, in
which the response of the regional groundwater system to RCF shaft excavation,
will constitute the largest scale of testing carried out so far.  The drawdowns
induced by the construction of the RCF will be significantly greater than those
which will have been imposed on the groundwater system by the existing
hydrogeological testing (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.88">paragraph 6.88</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.21 Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] presents in detail the methodology used
to derive a probability distribution function of effective permeability based
upon progressive upscaling from field data.  Different categories of flow
channels through which groundwater flows within each hydrogeological unit were
defined (e.g. paragraph 2.2 on page 2.1 and of Volume 2 on Nirex 95 [COR/522]). 
The models used to derive the effective parameters are illustrated in Figure 5.3
of Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] and the probability distribution functions
that characterise the uncertainty in effective permeabilities on a regional
scale of the hydrogeological units used in the modelling are listed in Figure
5.1 of the same document.
</P>
<P>7.22 The base case values of the effective hydrogeological parameters are
then summarised in Table 2.1 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.23 The models used in the Nirex 95 [COR/522] calculations incorporated
zones of hydraulically connected fractures which extended over scales of 50
metres to 5 kilometres.  These are termed Type II features in Nirex 95
[COR/522].  The models therefore explicitly incorporate features which will
permit the preferential flow of groundwater over long distances.  These features
had hydraulic conductivity values which ranged from 10<SUP>-11</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
to 10<SUP>-7</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.  Additionally, larger scale Type III
features were built into the models in the location of known major fault zones. 
These had generally higher values of hydraulic conductivity than the Type II
features.  As a result, the Nirex 95 [COR/522] models allow the preferential
flow of groundwater along selected features both within the BVG, and cutting
across the hydrogeological boundaries between the BVG and its overlying units. 
The hydraulic connectivity permitted by these modelling assumptions is thus
significant.
</P>
<P>7.24 More recent information on the large scale properties of the BVG are
now available. These arise from the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, which has involved
a three month pumping test in a selected zone of the BVG.  This zone was located
in the Sides Farm Member, between 638.9 metres bOD and 681.6 metres bOD.  It
contained two identified flow zones.  As seen in Drawing No. 10089 in Nirex
Report SA/95/002 [COR/518] and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.2">Figures 6.2</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, the zone
selected is one of the most productive sections within Borehole RCF3 and
contains the principal flow zones in the BVG encountered in this borehole.
</P>
<P>7.25 The models used for upscaling in Nirex 95 [COR/522], and a number of
alternative conceptual and numerical models of the fracture network in the BVG,
are being tested by comparison of model predictions with the results of the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  This is a stringent test of the models because three
months of pumping on the most productive zone in the borehole tests a much
larger volume of rock than the earlier borehole measurements on which the
fracture network models were based.
</P>
<P>7.26 Preliminary analyses of the result of these comparisons suggests that
the fracture network model giving the best comparisons is likely to have a lower
connectivity within the BVG than that predicted in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is
because it includes variations in fracture apertures within the Type II
features.  Such variations were not included in the parameterisation of Type II
features for Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Thus the system may be less well connected
than assumed in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P>7.27 Thus, it is concluded that the approach to treatment of hydraulic
conductivity values proposed by Professor Mather and Dr Haszeldine in their
proofs, whilst probably appropriate to the consideration of flow through thin
layers, such as landfill liners, is not appropriate to flow through sequences of
rock many hundreds of metres thick for assessment of the performance of a deep
repository.
</P>
<P><B>Alternative Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>7.28 In section 12 of his proof (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine presents the
results of groundwater flow modelling carried out by Glasgow University.  The
results of this modelling have been published in two papers referenced as
GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6.  In paragraph 12.1 on page 35 of his proof Dr Haszeldine
claims that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;My approach and results were significantly different to that
pursued by Nirex.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.29 Recognising the statement made by Dr Haszeldine, Nirex has undertaken a
systematic review of his modelling work as reported in the two papers cited by
him (GNP/3/4 and GNP/3/6) to establish whether and, if so, to what extent, his
results are actually significantly different from those of Nirex in a manner
which might have a bearing on the potential of the Sellafield site to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>7.30 On the basis of a systematic review of the modelling work undertaken by
Dr Haszeldine it is concluded that the differences he reports between his
modelling and that undertaken by Nirex arise for the following reasons:

<P>7.31 It is my assessment that if realistic parameters were used, Dr
Haszeldine's models would produce results broadly comparable to those presented
in much more detail by Nirex in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><U>Conceptual Model</U>
</P>
<P>7.32 The conceptual model adopted by Dr Haszeldine could not be fully
evaluated due to the lack of detail contained in his published papers.  However,
although in general the conceptualisation appeared to be a reasonable first
attempt at describing the Sellafield regional groundwater flow field, it was
noted that the parameters adopted did not accord with those presented in Nirex
Report 524 [COR/517].  This is discussed in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P><U>Geological Structure</U>
</P>
<P>7.33 The geological sequence used by Dr Haszeldine contains some differences
to that adopted by Nirex.  His model explicitly incorporates a large conductive
feature that originates at the surface and terminates immediately adjacent and
down groundwater gradient of the proposed repository.  Dr Haszeldine terms this
the 'Fleming Hall Fault Zone'.  A comparison of the structural cross section
used in their work corresponds with interpretations presented in 1992 in Nirex
Report 263 [COR/502].  Since the publication of this report in 1992 considerably
more information has been gathered and a revised structural interpretation was
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  As a result of these changes, a
structural feature similar to that proposed in Dr Haszeldine's model is not
located near the PRZ.

surface have hydraulic parameters which are considered unrealistic.  Dr
Haszeldine and his co-author note in the caption to Figure 6 (GNP/3/4, page 93)
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;BVG conductivity is the maximum measured in site investigation
boreholes...The Calder Sandstone set to low conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.35 There are also some more subtle, but none the less significant
discrepancies between the values for hydraulic conductivity used by Dr
Haszeldine and those given in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] particularly for the
Carboniferous Limestone and Brockram Formations.  Dr Haszeldine has selected
conductivity values approximately one order of magnitude lower than the values
reported by Nirex from the field measurements.  Because these geological units
contribute to the hydraulic separation between the upper sedimentary rocks and
the BVG, this discrepancy is significant.
</P>
<P>7.36 The range of hydraulic conductivity values assigned by Dr Haszeldine to
the BVG is a subset of the reported test results in Nirex Report 525 [COR/505]
and contains only the high and median values.  The selection of fault
conductivities and porosities also differ from those in Nirex Report 524
[COR/517].  Values of porosity utilised by Dr Haszeldine are also seen to be
different, in some cases by up to 100%, from the reported test results.
</P>
<P>7.37 Thus Dr Haszeldine has selectively taken data and results from Nirex
Report 524 (published in December 1993) [COR/517] and Nirex Report 263
(published in March 1992 on the basis of significantly more limited data)
[COR/502].
</P>
<P>7.38 The values of BVG and Calder Sandstone hydraulic conductivity used by
Dr Haszeldine in his central case significantly increase the predicted flow
velocity in the repository region, as compared to the median value.  The values
for the Brockram hydraulic conductivity adopted by Dr Haszeldine would tend to
produce lower flow and transport across that formation relative to the median
value.  These two factors combine together to focus groundwater flow in the
model into the imposed fault.  Thus, by careful selection of parameters for his
central case model, Dr Haszeldine has imposed a particular pattern of
groundwater flow.
</P>
<P><U>Regional hydraulic conductivity</U>
</P>
<P>7.39 There is an important distinction between the hydraulic conductivity
values used in the model, which are regional effective values, and the measured
hydraulic conductivity values which are essentially point values.  The measured
values can be expected to cover a wide range and to include some quite high
values in the 'tails' of the distribution due to the natural heterogeneity in
the rocks (see section 8 of this supplementary proof).  However, the regional
value, which will determine the overall flow rate, will be some average of the
local values depending on the connectivity as well as the conductivity of the
individual fractures.  Thus the existence of a few high measurements does not
automatically imply a high probability that Dr Haszeldine's arbitrary criterion
will be breached.  This issue has been discussed in <A HREF="#Para7.12">paragraphs
7.12</A> to 7.18 above.
</P>
<P><U>The results</U>
</P>
<P>7.40 Although the model adopted by Dr Haszeldine for his central case
comprises a pessimistic and unrealistic end member of the many models formed by
possible geometric aspects and hydrogeological characteristics at the potential
repository, this model predicted long groundwater return times of 10,000 to
15,000 years depending on modelled repository depths (Figures 6a and 7a of
GNP/3/4, pages 93 and 94).  The second set of models illustrated in Figures 6b
and 7b of GNP/3/4, in which the BVG conductivity was reduced to 3.8 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP>
ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, closer to the median value of 1 x 10<SUP>-10</SUP> ms<SUP>-1</SUP>
(<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.1">Figures 6.1</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>), and
hence provided a much more realistic representation of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone, not only produced a
significantly longer estimate of groundwater return time (200,000 years), but
also indicated a marine discharge (under current sea level conditions) for the
water rather than a terrestrial discharge given by the models which suppressed
the conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone.
</P>
<P>7.41 The selection of a geological structure and hydraulic parameters by Dr
Haszeldine has produced an extreme and pessimistic model of the Sellafield site.
 The model parameters, in particular, suppress the effects of the hydraulic
conductivity contrast between the BVG and the sandstone and focus groundwater
flow into a geological fault that has been imposed on the model immediately
downstream of the repository represented in the model.  Adoption of a more
realistic value for the hydraulic conductivity of the BVG reproduces the pattern
of groundwater flow shown in the Nirex 95 studies [COR/522] with marine
discharge to the west of the PRZ (assuming current sea level conditions).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is concluded that the conceptual model of the hydrogeology

<P>8.6 In paragraph 6.5.2 (page 29, PE/CCC/4) Professor Mather refers to the

<P><I>&quot;Encouraging progress has been made in determination of groundwater
chemistry.  The chemical composition of the waters provide an indication of the
origin, history and age of the waters.  This information helps to confirm the

groundwater pressures and hydraulic conductivity.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.9 The statements made by Nirex (see paragraph 8.7 above) clearly indicate
that the groundwater regimes were defined on the basis of the processes
occurring within these regimes and that the geochemical information has helped
to confirm the pattern of groundwater flow.  Professor Mather is thus wrong in
his paragraph 6.5.2 (page 29, PE/CCC/4) in which he seeks to indicate that the
regimes are defined on the basis of salinity.  Furthermore, the groundwater
salinities quoted by Professor Mather, assigned in that way to the regimes, are
not, as indicated by him, taken from Nirex Report 525 [COR/505], nor are they as
quoted in subsequent Nirex reports.

<P><A NAME="Para8.10"></A>8.10 Professor Mather is also wrong in his assertion
(PE/CCC/4, paragraph 6.6.7) that the model <I>&quot;hides the complex
inter-relationships between the various regimes&quot;</I>.  Professor Mather
confines his attention to a single figure (his Figure 4, PE/CCC/4) which is a
schematic representation of the broad features of the groundwater system.  He
ignores the detailed discussion of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] and
of the hydrogeochemistry in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Hence, it is
inevitable that he regards the model represented in his Figure 4 (PE/CCC/4) as
simplistic.  Nirex's description of conceptual models in Nirex 95 [COR/522] is
comprehensive and detailed.  The hydrogeochemical conceptual model in Nirex
Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is able to explain all of the compositions of
groundwater and, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.66">paragraph 6.66</A>

a simplification in which  complexities are being hidden.

<P><U>Issue  iii - the use of elicited data instead of measured data.  </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.17"></A>8.17 At paragraph 2.13 on page 9 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon describes the way in which Nirex has conceptualised the fractures within
the groundwater flow model presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  In the last
sentence of the paragraph, in referring to the parameters used to describe the
characteristics of these fractures, he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Of these, all except fracture orientations can not be adequately
quantified by the field characterisation programme alone, and reliance has
instead had to be placed on the elicitation of probability density functions
(PDF's) for the uncertainty about the mean and variance associated with the
distribution  of these parameters {S/95/012}, from a group of experts assembled
by Nirex (COR/508).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.18 It needs to be emphasised that the elicitation of parameter values for
modelling is based on data from the site characterisation programme.  At page
5.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95 [COR/522], the extent to which field data was used
as part of the elicitation process is made clear.  It states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Information on the orientation of the fractures can be obtained
from the field data [5.2].  Of the remaining parameters, it was considered most
appropriate to elicit distributions of fracture spacing, fractures length and
channelling fraction from the expert group, which were able to make reference,
in the course of the elicitation, to observations of the spacing of fractures
and flowing zones in the boreholes and to outcrop studies of fracture length&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.19 As stated in section 4 of Volume 2 of Nirex 95  [COR/522], fracture
transmissivities were not elicited, but were derived by requiring models to be
consistent with field data. The elicitation process is a structured and
appropriate response to dealing with uncertainties in field data.

independent review of the Nirex investigations at Sellafield by the Royal

Group Report.  The quote he uses is:

on page 143, column 1, of COR/605 from which it can be seen that Dr Salmon has
taken his quote from the summary of section 8 of the report.  The section in the
main body of the report is found on page 135, column 1, first full paragraph, of
COR/605.  This paragraph puts a somewhat different complexion on the assertions
made by Dr Salmon.  The paragraph states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Three points need emphasis.  First, the development of conceptual
hydrogeological models and their translation into numerical models of
groundwater flow are among the most difficult scientific problems Nirex have to
face at Sellafield.  Second, the underlying scientific work has been of high
quality.  Third, participants in the study had to work with a set of site
characterisation data considerably smaller than that available now (mid-1994),
and much less extensive than that which will be available when the site
characterisation programme is nearing completion, including tracer and other
tests in the RCF.  We therefore examined the work of the expert group with a
view to assessing the methodology rather than the soundness of the results.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.23 Dr Salmon's subsequent assertion in paragraph 2.8 (PE/FOE/5) that the
Royal Society Study Group Report comments were made because of the complexity of
the site seems difficult to understand as the statement about the complexity of
the hydrogeological system is not taken from the Royal Society Report [COR/605],
instead it is taken from a paper on the design of the RCF.
</P>
<P>8.24 Dr Salmon returns to this theme of elicitation at paragraph 3.17 on
page 25 of PE/FOE/5, where he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The Royal Society (COR/605) concluded that the elicitation
procedure, whereby experts used both limited site data and general data, is </I>'unlikely
to lead to defensible sets of parameter values'<I>.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.25"></A>8.25 The section of the Royal Society Study Group
Report [COR/605] that is relevant is section 8.2.4 commencing on page 134. 
Firstly, in the first paragraph of this section the Royal Society Study Group
make it clear that the Nirex study they are referring to was the one carried out
in early 1993 and was based on limited data (in effect, although not
specifically stated, this was the data in Nirex Report 268 [COR/521] based only
on the results from Boreholes 1, 2, 3 and 4).  Secondly, in the second paragraph
of page 135 (quoted in full in paragraph 9.11 above), the Royal Society Study
Group Report makes it clear that more data were available at the time they
reported and which had not been available when the elicitation study was carried
out.  They also made it clear that more data would become available,
particularly from the RCF.  Finally, in the second paragraph in column 2 on page
135 [COR/605], from which Dr Salmon's quote is taken, the Royal Society Study
Group is making the point that elicitation in the absence of site-specific data
is unlikely to lead to defensible sets of parameter values, but that <I>&quot;ideally
this would be largely replaced by one of scale-up calculations based on
extensive field data&quot;</I>.  This is indeed the approach being adopted by
Nirex.
</P>
<P>8.26 By the use of selective quotations, and by confusing comments made on a
much earlier elicitation study (known to be based on limited data) with his own
comments made on the conceptual model development reported in Nirex 95
[COR/522], Dr Salmon has misrepresented the extent to which Nirex 95 has been
based on actual field data.  He has also apparently ignored the points made both
in my evidence (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.83">paragraph 6.83</A> to 6.88 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>)
and by the Royal Society Study Group that the RCF has an important role in
providing the required additional data.
</P>
<P><U>Issue  iv - Dr Salmon's interpretation of the hydrogeological field
tests differs from that presented by Nirex. </U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.27"></A>8.27 At paragraph 2.19 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon comments
on the results of various hydrogeological testing programmes.  Apart from Dr
Salmon's discussion of  the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, I do not disagree with the
comments he makes and find them to be substantially as given in my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.35">paragraphs 6.35</A> to 6.45).  In commenting on
the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, Dr Salmon has confused the borehole interference
effects observed in the boreholes with the results of the pump test.  These
interference effects are described in Appendix 2 to my evidence (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.8">paragraphs B.2.8</A> to B.2.10 on pages B.4 and B.5
of Appendix 2 to <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and illustrated in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> (Appendix 2,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  They are also described in somewhat more detail in
paragraphs 7.21 to 7.29 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]. 
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#FigB21">Figure B.2.1</A> in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
shows these interference effects and the smooth responses observed in the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test after January 1995.  These two datasets have been used
in complementary ways to provide information on hydrogeological conditions in
the PRZ.
</P>
<P>8.28 In paragraph 2.20 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5, page 14), Dr Salmon states
that his interpretation of the field tests differ in both substance and tone
from those presented in my evidence.  I do not agree that the two
interpretations differ in substance although they may differ in tone.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - first bullet point</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.29"></A>8.29 In the first bullet point on page 14 (PE/FOE/4)
Dr Salmon disputes that the fracture network may be less well connected than
previously considered.  I stand by my original statement and point to the
description of the fracture networks as presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522] as
justification.  It is important to recall that Nirex 95 was based on the data
presented in Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] which pre-dates the hydrogeological
testing to which we are now referring. (See the third paragraph of the Preface
to Nirex 95 [COR/522].)
</P>
<P>8.30 The extent to which the Nirex 95 models represented fracture
connectivity is best illustrated by Figures 2.1, 5.3 and 5.5 in Volume 2 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522].  These illustrate the ways in which fractures are
represented in the model and show:

<P>8.31 Thus, for example, Figure 5.5 in Volume 2 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]
specifically shows the way in which the Basal Deep St Bees Sandstone, the
section containing the siltstone and claystone bands later identified as the
North Head Member, was shown as containing transmissive fractures and major
faults cutting it.  Thus the model recognised the possibility of connections
through this part of the sequence connecting the Brockram to the higher parts of
the sandstone sequence.  In contrast to this, later work (for example paragraph
8.6 of Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524]) has shown that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The North Head Member is identified as an interval at the base of
the St Bees Sandstone with distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties
from the overlying St Bees Sandstone.  The claystone bed at the top of the North
Head Member is considered to be a possible low permeability control on flow
between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstone.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para8.32"></A>8.32 The preliminary results from the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test (Brockram Phase) have shown that the North Head Member attenuates the
hydraulic responses to pumping in the Brockram.  No responses were observed in
the sequence above the North Head Member.  As a result of this, it is possible
to conclude that in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3, any sub-vertical joints and
fractures that may occur within the Brockram and extend up into the sandstones
do not result in a strong hydraulic connection between the Brockram/North Head
Member, and the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstones. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.33"></A>8.33 Further information which helps to confirm this
limited connectivity in the vicinity of Borehole RCF3 is provided by the
monitoring of salinity in the different stages of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test. 
The sandstone test was located just above the saline transition zone; the water
pumped from the hole remained fresh.  The Brockram test was located immediately
below the saline transition zone; the pumped water remained saline.
</P>
<P>8.34 The basis of my statement in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.70">paragraph
6.70</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> is thus the comparison of  judgements made in the
Nirex 95 models with the observations made in the testing.  This enhancement in
our understanding of the connectivity within the system will be incorporated
into the groundwater models which we will be developing as a next stage from
Nirex 95 and as the basis for developing the predictions for the RCF shaft
drawdown experiment.
</P>
<P>8.35 Dr Salmon appears to criticise the Fracture Network Testing on page 15
of his proof (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 2.20).  He refers to the <I>&quot;inability
of such testing to identify connections within the fracture system in lateral
directions away from a borehole&quot;</I>.  Dr Salmon is correct in recognising
that the Fracture Network Testing does not identify lateral connections; it is
not designed to do so.  It is part of an integrated programme of post completion
testing as described in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A> on page A.27 of
Appendix 1 to my proof (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  This refers to the fact that the
Fracture Network Testing was designed to <I>&quot;provide complete coverage of
the section of the borehole within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group&quot;</I>.  By
testing a continuous section of borehole with test sections both containing and
not containing identified flow zones (<A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.5">Figure
6.5</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) it was possible to provide statistical coverage of
the BVG.  This testing needs to be viewed in association with the other major
programmes of post completion testing (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA8">Table A.8</A>,
Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) namely the Short Interval Hydraulic Testing, the Cross-Hole
Hydraulic Testing and the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  The Cross-Hole Hydraulic
Testing, the Borehole RCF3 Pump test, and ultimately the RCF shaft drawdown
experiment are the parts of the testing programme specifically designed to
investigate lateral connections.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - second bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.36 On page 15 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon appears to be confusing the results
of the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test with the information from the observation of
interferences between boreholes during drilling reported in Nirex Report
S/95/007 [COR/524].  The two sets of data are not incompatible, although the
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test is able to reveal the connections in a more systematic
manner, as discussed in <A HREF="#Para8.27">paragraphs 8.27</A> and 8.32 above.
Dr Salmon also comments, on page 15 (PE/FOE/5), that I have failed to explain
the existence of the <I>&quot;unusually low environmental heads&quot;</I> in
the BVG <I>&quot;which may indicate some vertical connectivity with the cover
rocks&quot;</I>.  Reference to the descriptions of the models in Nirex 95
[COR/522] should have indicated to Dr Salmon that the possibility of such
connections are explicitly recognised in Nirex 95 by the incorporation of both
Type II and Type III features in the model.  Furthermore, it should be again
pointed out that Nirex 95 indicates that the site is likely to be able to meet
regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Third bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.37 The point made by Dr Salmon at the top of page 16 of PE/FOE/5 related
to hydrochemistry is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof. 
However, at the end of that paragraph on page 16, Dr Salmon makes the remark
that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is also quite possible that any differences in water quality
are lost or reduced as deeper groundwater moves to the surface, via processes
such as dilution&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.38 In making this remark Dr Salmon is recognising the favourable
characteristic of the Sellafield site in offering dilution of waters which may
leave the BVG as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.71">paragraphs 6.71</A> to
6.73 of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fourth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.39 On page 16 of PE/FOE/5, Dr Salmon comments that the head distributions
are not as consistent as I had implied.  He is correct in identifying some
heterogeneity in the heads observed in the boreholes.  This can be seen by the
small-scale variability of the heads in Figure 6.8 of PE/FOE/14 and more clearly
by the plots of environmental heads with depth shown for the individual
boreholes in Drawing Nos. 100111 to 10131 of Nirex Report SA/95/002 [COR/518]. 
Indeed, this heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of fractured rock masses.
</P>
<P><U>Paragraph 2.20 - Fifth bullet point</U>
</P>
<P>8.40 In the final bullet point of paragraph 2.20 on page 17 of PE/FOE/5, Dr
Salmon seeks to dismiss the geochemical information on the grounds that there
are <I>&quot;relatively few samples&quot;</I>.  He then concludes that <I>&quot;Therefore
the possibility of flowpaths with relatively short travel times cannot be
discounted&quot;</I>.  There are two points arising from this conclusion. 
Firstly, the possibility of there being such flowpaths out of the BVG has been
specifically recognised by the Nirex 95 models.  For example, Table 2.3 in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] shows the travel times for different pathways. 
Paths B and C show significantly shorter travel times than Path A for flow to
the top of the BVG because of the pathline intersecting one of the Type II
features.  Secondly, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraphs 8.15</A>
and <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para9.9">9.9</A> of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the
RCF is required to investigate the nature and distribution of these networks of
connected fractures.  One of the reasons, as stated in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.15">paragraph 8.15</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>, is to
determine the extent to which it might be possible to locate vaults to limit the
intersections between the networks of connected fractures and the repository
vaults.
</P>
<P>8.41 In respect of Dr Salmon's comment that relatively few samples have been
obtained, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix1">Appendices 1</A> and
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">2</A> of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> summarise the
substantial programme of geochemical sampling that has been carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Issue v - There must be some doubt that Nirex will ever be able to
predict groundwater flow with confidence</U>
</P>
<P>8.42 Given the substantial progress made so far in understanding and
modelling groundwater flow at Sellafield, I cannot agree with the comment made
by Dr Salmon in paragraph 2.21 on page 17 (PE/FOE/5) that there must be some
doubt that Nirex will ever be able to predict groundwater flow with confidence. 
He has presented no evidence to support such an assertion.  Furthermore, his
references to the complexity of the site and 'other site criteria' are
reiterations of his inappropriate use of qualitative 'criteria' (see sections 2
and 3 of this supplementary proof).
</P>
<P><U>Closing comments on Dr Salmon's conclusions to his section 2 (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.43 I disagree with the conclusions reached by Dr Salmon on page 18 of

<P><U>Upward Flow</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.45"></A>8.45 The existence of head gradients at the site is
a feature of the site which has long been appreciated.  Paragraph 8.14.5 of
<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] recognised the possibility of <I>&quot;the propagation
of groundwater heads into the basement.&quot;</I>  Our understanding of head
gradients at Sellafield is described in the section of my evidence dealing with
'Groundwater Heads and Gradients' (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.48">paragraphs 6.48</A>
to 6.59 on pages 39 to 42 of
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>8.46 In just the same way as other hydrogeological 'criteria' cannot be used
to assess the site, similarly head gradients cannot be used in this way. 
However, the impacts of head gradients have been examined in Nirex 95 [COR/522]
in calculations that have indicated that the performance of a repository is
likely to meet regulatory requirements (see, for example, the variant
calculations in sections 7.3 and 7.4 of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522]).  This
is because the low hydraulic conductivity in the BVG, coupled with the potential
for dilution in the overlying cover rocks leads to an acceptable performance of
the site.
</P>
<P>8.47 Professor Mather (paragraph 6.7.1, PE/CCC/4) suggests that there is
evidence from hydrogeochemical data suggesting upward flow.  This is discussed
in section 9 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Potential for flow into the PRZ</U>
</P>
<P>8.48 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 8.2 and Figures 8.1 a, and b, PE/GNP/3)
interprets contours of environmental head to infer potential for horizontal
flow.  This is incorrect as the potential for horizontal flow is given by
freshwater heads (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.8">paragraph 6.8</A>, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
 This is explained in more detail in section 4.4.3 (page 4-4) and Figure 4.2 in
Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517].  Dr Haszeldine has also omitted to
record the statement made at the foot of page 4-7 of Nirex Report 524, Volume 3
[COR/517] in which the diagrams that he has interpreted are explained with the
comment that they are
<I>&quot;intended to demonstrate only that groundwater heads in this region of
the BVG are variable&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.49 The variable nature of the heads in a fractured rock such as the BVG is
a feature of such systems.  It is therefore questionable as to whether such
local data can reliably be used, in the way Dr Haszeldine has, to infer regional
patterns.
</P>
<P>8.50 A regional interpretation of the head data is presented in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.58">paragraphs 6.58</A> to 6.59 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>
which indicates that a consistent pattern of head gradients towards the coast is
recognised in the area.  A more regional interpretation of data, such as that
presented in Figure 8.1b of PE/GNP/3 would indicate flow diverging from the PRZ,
the opposite to the pattern suggested by Dr Haszeldine.Dr Haszeldine (paragraphs
8.2 and 8.3, PE/GNP/3) suggests the presence of a 'flow axis' associated with
the structural crest of a NE-SW trending fault block.  In paragraph 8.4
(PE/GNP/3) this idea is given the status of <I>&quot;the main subsurface axis
of flow potential of (sic) meteoric water moving from the Lake District towards
the coast&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>8.51 This idea is, of course, only relevant if Dr Haszeldine's assertions
about converging groundwater flow are supported, which, as stated above, they
are not.  In any case, the main sub-surface route for meteoric water flow from
the fells towards the coast is in the Sherwood Sandstone Group.
</P>
<P>8.52 In paragraph 8.4 (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine claims that the PRZ is in
the worst position within the Site from the standpoint of hydrogeological
containment.  This conclusion is based on the spurious idea of the &quot;subsurface
flow axis&quot;.  The basis for selecting the PRZ is explained in
<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para8.2">paragraphs 8.2</A> to 8.10 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Location of Discharge</U>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.53"></A>8.53 Professor Mather states (Paragraph 6.6.5,
PE/CCC/4):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;discharge in the shore zone is a more realistic assumption for
modelling purposes than discharge offshore into the Irish Sea.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.54 Professor Mather implies that it was assumed by Nirex that discharge
was offshore and into the Irish Sea, and that this assumption was built into the
models used, for example, for the calculations of groundwater flow presented in
Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522].  This is not the case.  The locations of
discharges are predicted as an output from the modelling, they are not an input
to the modelling.
</P>
<P>8.55 Figure 2.6b of Volume 3 of Nirex 95 [COR/522] illustrates that the
models used in Nirex 95 do indeed predict some level of terrestrial discharge
under the current groundwater conditions.  As stated on page 2.12 of Volume 3 of
Nirex 95 [COR/522]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the main region of radionuclide discharge is from about a hundred
metres offshore to about a kilometre offshore. This region is just beyond the
main region of groundwater discharge which extends to about a hundred metres
offshore&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.56 The peak of groundwater discharge from the Calder sandstone and
Quaternary deposits is very close to the coast, and the discharge falls off
quite quickly with distance offshore.
</P>
<P>8.57 These predictions are consistent with a number of observations made at
the site, including those quoted by Professor Mather and resulting from the 1977
- 1979 studies of Holmes and Hall [CCC/4/3].  
</P>
<P>8.58 Nirex has undertaken sampling of  freshwater spring discharges from
foreshores in the vicinity of the site.  This confirms the view that some
groundwater from the near surface groundwater flow systems will discharge on the
coast.  
</P>
<P>8.59 However, consideration of the chloride profiles for the two Nirex
boreholes drilled near the coast (Boreholes 3 and 13A) (Appendix C, Nirex Report
S/95/008 [COR/524]) indicate a substantial (300 - 400 metres) thickness of fresh
and brackish waters.  This would imply that a fair proportion of the fresher
waters moving in the upper part of the sandstones and comprising the Coastal

<P><B>Numerical Groundwater Flow Modelling</B>
</P>
<P>8.60 For the Objectors, numerical groundwater flow modelling is primarily
addressed by three proofs that I am responding to in this supplementary proof:
Dr Haszeldine (PE/GNP/3), Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5) and Dr Hencher (PE/FOE/6).  Dr
Haszeldine has presented some of his own modelling; this has been addressed in
section 7 of this supplementary proof.  Within the following part of section 8,
I address the issues raised by Dr Salmon and Dr Hencher on aspects of numerical
modelling.  I also describe some aspects of the recent and current
hydrogeological modelling being undertaken by Nirex, in addition to that
described in Nirex 95 [COR/95] to demonstrate the range and extent of the work
being carried out.
</P>
<P><U>Dr Salmon (PE/FOE/5)</U>
</P>
<P>8.61 In section 3 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon criticises the
modelling work undertaken by Nirex and, in paragraph 3.33 on page 33 recommends
that additional modelling work should be undertaken which is likely to take at
least another year to complete before the RCF is contemplated.  As Mr Folger has
stated in his supplementary proof (<B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>) at
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A> on page 6, the revised
schedule for the RCF <B> </B>shows commencement of the RCF South Shaft in
December 1997, some two years hence.  Thus, even if Nirex accepted all the
recommendations made by Dr Salmon for additional modelling, the work could be
completed well ahead of commencement of shaft sinking.  Dr Salmon's argument
that the RCF is premature is thus irrelevant.

<P>8.66 These issues are taken together in the paragraphs that follow.
</P>
<P>8.67 In section 5 of his proof (PE/FOE/6), Dr Hencher, in paragraph 5.5 on
page 11 recognises the importance of a stochastic approach to fracture flow. The
role of this in characterising the site is described previously in this
supplementary proof (section 5).<B></B>Dr Hencher states in paragraph 5.5:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Channel flow generally follows a complex and tortuous path between
the two rock walls of a single fracture and along the intersection of different
fractures.  The interaction of fractures may allow the development of a
continuous flow path through the rock mass.  As discussed later, the statistical
potential for fractures to intersect on the basis of their perceived typical
geometries within the rock mass is the starting point and main controlling
factor within mathematical models of discrete fracture networks.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.68 This observation contrasts with the themes of the proofs by both Dr
Kokelaar (PE/FOE/2) and Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3) who argue that a
deterministic approach is required in which rock units, faults and fractures
need to be located individually and precisely as the basis for hydrogeological
modelling.  Thus, for example at paragraph 10.2 in Professor Smythe's evidence
(PE/FOE/3, page 50) he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;An essential prerequisite for hydrogeological modelling is to
establish the geological structure accurately both in and around the PRZ. 
Inconsistencies in the current interpretation show that major faults, as well a
minor geological structures, are likely to have been misinterpreted and/or not
identified.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.69 The Nirex approach is to recognise that characterisation and modelling
of the hydrogeology of a site requires a combination of the deterministic and
stochastic approach.  Thus on page 5-1 of Volume 3 of  Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A general premise underlies work on the hydrogeology of fractured
rocks.  It is assumed that water bearing fractures of all sizes exist within a
region being investigated.  Even though the distribution of fracture sizes may
be single or multi-modal (Figure 5.1a) it is further assumed that there are more
small fractures than large (in terms of extensiveness).  It is often assumed
that it is possible to explicitly identify the most extensive fractures, and
that they will have consistent assignable properties.  This has the effect of
dividing the hydrogeological system into a large-scale deterministic sub-system
alongside a smaller scale probabilistic sub-system (Figures 5.1b and c).  The
division is based on the values of fracture extensiveness, fracture
transmissivity and the certainty of identification and parameter assignment. 
The values at which the division is chosen vary from rock to rock, site to site
and progress during an investigation.  Certain large scale (regional) structural
features may influence hydraulic properties as much as lithological variation
and these have also to be considered.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.70 This same approach is described in section 1 of Volume 1 of Nirex 95
[COR/522].  On page 1.2 it states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;All hydrogeological modelling is based on representation, which
are usually simplifications (abstractions) of the underlying conceptual
model.....The numerical models aim to treat the important aspects of the system
in a way that is realistic, but is at an appropriate level of complexity,
without unnecessary detail.  Thus, for example, when groundwater flow in a
fractured rock on a regional scale is to be modelled, it would not be practical
to represent explicitly the extremely large numbers of fractures such a model
would involve.  In any case, such a model would provide far more detail than is
required.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.71 In paragraph 5.6 of his proof (PE/FOE/6) on page 11, Dr Hencher refers
to the heterogeneous response of oil wells.  He then goes on in paragraph 5.7 to
interpret this observation as being due to <I>&quot;the complex and variable
nature of fluid flow within fractured rock&quot;</I>.  The natural heterogeneity
in fractured rocks is indeed a feature of these materials and needs to be
explicitly dealt with.  This is clearly recognised in the conceptual and
numerical modelling work presented in Nirex 95 [COR/522].  Providing such
heterogeneity is dealt with in an appropriate manner it can simply be regarded
as a characteristic of the system rather than  being regarded as a source of
particular difficulty.
</P>
<P>8.72 In heterogeneous rock masses, as stated above, it is not necessary to
explicitly characterise and understand each and every fracture in order to
understand groundwater flow through the system.  It is, however, essential in
interpreting the results of small scale observations and measurements made
within the system, to recognise that these results will themselves reflect the
natural heterogeneity of the system.  Statements made in several of the
Objectors' proofs referring to a perceived lack of predictability of the system
at Sellafield reflect the lack of appreciation of three important aspects of
dealing with low permeability, heterogeneous systems, namely:

<P>8.73 Spatial variability has also been discussed in section 5 above.
</P>
<P>8.74 Dr Hencher does, however, state in paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of his
evidence (PE/FOE/6, page 6):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It will be argued that until Nirex are able to demonstrate that
they understand data from existing sites and ongoing planned activities in
generic laboratories, they should not disturb the site at Sellafield, perhaps
irrevocably.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is concluded that to proceed to the RCF stage of repository
development prior to satisfactory completion of underlying generic research work
and validation of numerical models would be premature and ill-conceived.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.75 Dr Hencher is proposing an approach to the investigation of the site
which is different to that proposed by the Royal Society Study Group.  In their
report [COR/605] on page 110 they state (emphasis added):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;There are two routes forward and we expect Nirex to pursue both of
them: a continued effort to improve physical understanding of the relationship
between fracturing and water flow, and how these might change under possible
future conditions; and a palaeohydrogeological approach to the problem based on
observed present-day groundwater geochemistry and its relationship to historical
flow conditions.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>The RCF will yield valuable information for the two approaches
outlined above, as well as providing data on the potential effects of repository
construction on the BVG, and allowing progress to be made on repository design.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.76 Fracture flow modelling is widely recognised as being an appropriate
technique for modelling groundwater flow and transport in low-permeability
fractured rocks.  It is used within the Swedish, US, Swiss, Finnish and Japanese
national radioactive waste disposal programmes, and of course the UK programme.

</P>
<P><U>Summary on Nirex Hydrogeological Modelling Studies</U>
</P>
<P>8.77 Several opposition proofs (for example PE/FOE/5, paragraph 3.25)
criticise Nirex for not using a wider range of models.  In fact a wide range of
conceptual and mathematical models are used.  Previous work is described in
section 6 of Volume 3 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] and in Nirex 95 [COR/522]. 
</P>
<P>8.78 Ongoing modelling studies are outlined in <A HREF="#Para8.89">paragraphs
8.89</A> to 8.102 of this supplementary proof.  Results from these studies are
still being assimilated and have not yet been published.  However, preliminary
analysis indicates that the models consistently predict low flow in the BVG and
further advances have been made in reproducing the distributions of pressure
head and salinity.
</P>
<P><B>The role of the RCF in understanding the regional hydrogeology</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.79"></A>8.79 In paragraph 7.2 (PE/CCC/4, page 43) Professor
Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF .... will add little to our knowledge of the regional
picture fundamental to an understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.80 Professor Mather accepts for the RCF solely that (paragraph 7.2, page
42, PE/CCC/4):-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The RCF will enable the scale over which these networks are
observed to be up-rated from that of the borehole to that of the shafts and

will allow a more detailed understanding of the fracture network than it is
possible to obtain from surface boreholes and remote geophysical
measurements,......&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.81 He justifies his claim that the RCF will not assist in understanding
the hydrogeology by appealing to his review of the results of the Nirex
hydrogeological investigations and continuing that (paragraph 7.2 pages 42/43):-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;...... the complexity and unpredictability of the hydrogeology
which has been highlighted in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence means that
Nirex may well be able to get no nearer to obtaining a comprehensive
understanding of the networks of fractures and the controls of groundwater flow
than they are at present.  The RCF will provide data on the near-field and will
add little to our knowledge of the regional picture fundamental to an
understanding of the controls on groundwater flow.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.82 I do not agree with the assertions made by Professor Mather that the
RCF will not address issues related to the regional hydrogeology and set out in
the following paragraphs the reasons why I disagree with him.
</P>
<P>8.83 Regional hydrogeology is a term applied to the large-scale (kilometres
to tens of kilometres) pattern of groundwater movement in a flow system whose
boundaries and driving forces can be reasonably well defined and related to
geological and geographical features.
</P>
<P>8.84 Our current understanding of the regional hydrogeology of the
Sellafield area comes from a combination of hydraulic and hydrochemical data
from deep boreholes and studies of both present-day and historic records of
surface hydrology and sandstone hydrogeology (see section 10 of this
supplementary proof for information on the extent of this historical data). 
Most recently, this understanding was used to construct the regional flow model
which figures centrally in Nirex 95 [COR/522].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.85"></A>8.85 The RCF programme addresses many issues apart
from regional hydrogeology, but it will provide four main contributions to the
current understanding:

<TD WIDTH="800">The <B>shaft drawdown data</B> will allow the comparison and
testing of different models of flow in both the BVG and the overlying cover
rocks by imposing a hydraulic signal which will affect many hundreds of millions
of cubic metres of rock.  The information from these tests can be readily scaled
to the regional level.  The Borehole RCF3 Pump Test was a smaller scale version
of the same concept and tested six alternative models of flow in the BVG and two
in the overlying cover rocks.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>8.86 This latter aspect of the investigations, regarding the shaft drawdown
data, is consistent with that recommended by RWMAC in 1991 where they commented
on the Nirex site investigation programme that (RWMAC, Twelfth Annual Report,
1991, [GOV/404], page 11, paragraph 2.10):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, groundwater flow in basement-type rocks is dominated by
flow along fractures and it is unlikely that even several boreholes and the most
careful geophysics will be able to locate with any certainty all the important
groundwater channels.  Better awareness of the extent of the hydraulic coupling
between the groundwater in the cover sandstones and the basement below will be
obtained from observations of the response of the groundwater system to the
progressive stages of excavation of the shafts, and then the tunnels, associated
with the repository.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The reference to the repository is because this statement was made by the
RWMAC before the decision was taken to break-out the RCF as a separate activity.
 The comments regarding the usefulness of data from monitoring the response of
the groundwater system to excavation of shafts and galleries apply equally well
to the RCF as they did in 1991 to the repository.
</P>
<P>8.87 The RCF is not the only contributor to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology. An integrated programme of regional investigations has been
underway since 1991.  The first two stages of this programme involved collecting
historical data and data from the Nirex deep boreholes.  This has involved
gathering meteorological, spring, river and stream, mine working and pre-Nirex
borehole data.  The current stage is concerned with setting up automated
monitoring networks to collect meteorological, hydrological and groundwater data
(see description of Regional Hydrogeological Surveys in
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#TA2">Table A.2</A>, Appendix 1,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  These networks will also be used to monitor the impact of
RCF construction.
</P>
<P>8.88 The forward programme of deep borehole drilling and testing (<A
HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Figure6.3">Table 6.3</A>,
<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) will contribute further to understanding of the regional
hydrogeology.
</P>
<P><B>Recommendations for further investigations</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.89"></A>8.89 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/5) Dr
Salmon presents a series of recommendations for further surface-based
investigation studies and modelling.  Mr Reeves (PE/FOE/4, paragraph 8.5) also
presents recommendations for further investigations.  In paragraph 5.2 on page
46 (PE/FOE/5) Dr Salmon states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The need for further surface-based investigations and modelling
has been a central thread of my Evidence.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.90 Dr Salmon concludes (PE/FOE/5, paragraph 6.1, page 52):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that a RCF should not proceed until the work that I
have recommended has been satisfactorily completed, including a proper peer
review and due regard being paid to any subsequent comments&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.91 In Dr Salmon's final conclusion on page 53 (PE/FOE/5) at paragraph 6.6
he states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In conclusion, I appreciate the eventual need for a RCF as part of
a repository development programme, but consider that the Sellafield RCF
planning application is premature.  Given the hydrogeological complexity of
Sellafield I also consider that Nirex should commence surface investigations at
other, more hydrogeologically favourable sites&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.92 In his final conclusion, Dr Salmon appears to recognise that the
Sellafield site may be shown to be a suitable repository site.  He is basing his
objection largely on the issue of prematurity.  The issue of alternative sites
has been addressed in section 4 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P>8.93 At paragraph 5.3 on pages 46 and 47 (PE/FOE/5) he sets out seven &quot;aims&quot;
for this further work that he recommends.  In paragraph 5.5 he sets out in more
detail examples of the types of investigations he considers are required.  He
concludes in paragraph 5.6 (PE/FOE/5) that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I estimate that these tasks (excluding that for aim 6 which needs
to be further defined by Nirex) will take five or six years to complete.  Most
of this period is devoted to the establishment of baseline conditions.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.94 I do not disagree substantially with the statements made by Dr Salmon
concerning the range of additional surface-based work since all the aims raised
by him are already incorporated into Nirex's overall programme as explained
below.  I do, however, disagree with his views on timing, both with regard to
the length of time required to establish baseline hydrogeological conditions and
the extent to which the work can proceed in parallel with the RCF. The time
required to establish baseline conditions is dealt with in section 10 of this
supplementary proof.  Much of the other work described by Dr Salmon can proceed
in parallel with the schedule for the RCF.  These aims are discussed  below.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 1: to define further the geological sequence and hydrogeology in
three dimensions</U>
</P>
<P>8.95 Dr Salmon suggests two further boreholes on land and suggests that
there may be a case for one or more deep offshore boreholes to better
characterise the main potential radionuclide discharge area (see also Mr Reeves
PE/FOE/4, paragraph 7.3).  <A HREF="nrx14fig.htm#Table6.3">Table 6.3</A> in my
evidence (PE/FOE/14) summarises the planned programme of further surface-based
investigations.  This includes up to two boreholes to the south of the PRZ in
the area between Boreholes 2 and 11.  These are shown as 'drilling into the
Seascale Fault Zone'.  It is anticipated that this work can be carried out by
inclined drilling from the Borehole 11 site, but consideration is also being
given to whether it would be most appropriate to carry out this drilling from an
alternative site.  Up to four boreholes (Boreholes 15 to 18) are already planned
to investigate the saline transition zone, including in the area to the west of
the site on the predicted pathlines for groundwater flow that has passed through
the repository. Work on the first two of these boreholes is currently delayed as
Cumbria County Council have deferred a decision on the planning application. 
Drilling onshore is preferred for two reasons.  Firstly, it provides easier
access for long-term testing and monitoring, and secondly, it is considerably
cheaper than drilling offshore.  Information from drilling offshore needs to be
shown to have a significant benefit to our confidence in the evaluation of the
repository system before a commitment should be made. Currently, such a
commitment cannot be justified.  Regarding drilling to the north-west of
Borehole RCF3, Nirex does not consider that such a borehole is required, given
the scope for investigation from the RCF itself. Thus the proposals made by Dr
Salmon have been included within Nirex's future  programme of work.  As the
additional boreholes are at some considerable distance from the RCF, in areas
unlikely to be influenced by the RCF, there is no reason why this work should
not proceed in parallel with the RCF.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 2: to determine baseline environmental head and geochemical
conditions</U>
</P>
<P>8.96 This issue is dealt with in section 10 of this supplementary proof.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 3: to test further the connectivity of strata and fractures</U>
</P>
<P>8.97 Dr Salmon states that the scope for further cross-borehole tests and
pump tests is limited.  Nirex is currently analysing the results of the Borehole
RCF 3 Pump Test and considering tracer tests.  The monitoring system installed
in the deep boreholes is designed to allow sampling of groundwater for
monitoring of chemical variation and detection of tracers.  The need for further
tests will be reviewed in the light of results to date and further work will be
planned to complement testing associated with the phased RCF development.  Tests
of the connectivity of strata and fractures around the RCF and Potential
Repository Zone are best done by monitoring the disturbance due to activities
such as the controlled disturbance to the groundwater from shaft sinking.  This
will particularly measure the connectivity between the fracture networks in the
BVG and the porous strata in the cover sequence.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 4 : to refine the model in an attempt to enable it adequately to
replicate existing groundwater conditions and the effect of any field testing</U>
</P>
<P>8.98 Nirex generally agrees - this is what we are doing with our ongoing
hydrogeological characterisation and modelling and the RCF is a further
development of this process.  We are not just refining one model but are
developing and testing a range of models to develop understanding of the
hydrogeological system.  None of this activity needs to delay RCF construction
as the phased RCF activities will help to refine, develop and validate the
models and their prediction of responses to RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 5 : to model the impact of the proposed RCF construction on baseline
conditions and the PCPA</U>
</P>
<P>8.99 Nirex agrees - such modelling is part of our planned programme.  As
Salmon accepts, it is part of model development as discussed above.  This is
programmed in as part of the experimentation and modelling related to the phased
RCF development.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 6 : to assess the effectiveness of sealing techniques</U>
</P>
<P>8.100 This is part of Nirex's ongoing research.  Current laboratory results
will be further developed once the RCF is developed.
</P>
<P><U>Aim 7 : to begin to develop more appropriate modelling strategies for
determining the long-term safety case of any future repository proposals</U>
</P>
<P>8.101 The current strategy is an appropriate one for this stage of the
investigation (Nirex S/94/004 [COR/510]).  However, further developments are
planned, e.g. to take account of new data from the analysis of the Borehole RCF3
Pump Test and to investigate particular issues.  Such plans are highlighted in
Section 3 of Nirex Report S/94/004 [COR/510].
</P>
<P>8.102 Thus, all the work suggested as being necessary by Dr Salmon, and
more, is already in hand or planned by Nirex as part of an integrated programme
of site characterisation of which the RCF forms a part.  There are no reasons
for this work to delay the granting of planning permission for the RCF.

<P>9.4 Our responses to these seven concerns are enlarged upon in the remainder
of this section.
</P>
<P><B>Lack of geochemical boreholes</B>
</P>
<P>9.5 In paragraph 6.5.1 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to
obtain hydrogeochemical data is one of the major deficiencies of the current
borehole programme.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.6 Nirex has drilled both deep and shallow boreholes at the Sellafield site
to gain a regional understanding of the groundwater flow and hydrochemical
patterns across the site. These boreholes have had multiple objectives, as a
number of features have been required to be explored by each borehole.  The
collection of groundwater samples from the Sellafield boreholes, in particular
in the BVG, is further complicated by the generally low groundwater flow. This
restricts the amount of water available for collection in any given period of
time. Rigorous procedures have been applied to the collection and evaluation of
groundwater samples, in order to ensure that the best feasible quality has been
achieved, and that any contamination resulting from the drilling of the borehole
or from other sample collection effects can be assessed and corrected for in
determining in-situ groundwater compositions. These issues have been previously
discussed in my Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, Appendix 1,
<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaA4.4">Sections A4.4</A> - A4.6).
</P>
<P>9.7 The subject of the reliability of the geochemical data from the deep
boreholes was a matter about which the Royal Society Study Group showed
considerable interest.  Information was presented to the Study Group by Nirex
specialists and, as a result, on page 105 of their report [COR/605] the Study
Group states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Nirex have thus demonstrated a capability to obtain high quality
hydrochemical samples from existing boreholes.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.8 This information, presented to the Royal Society Study Group, was
subsequently written up as a technical report for Nirex {Nirex Report 701} which
is referenced in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather makes no
mention of having consulted this report.
</P>
<P>9.9 The second point concerning Professor Mather's comments on geochemical
boreholes is that Nirex has applied on 30 May 1995 for planning permission to
drill two boreholes (Boreholes 15 and 16).  The covering letters to Cumbria
County Council (Ref: DB/ah/PZ/PP/225 and 226) that accompanied these
applications state <I>&quot;The primary objective of these boreholes is to
extend the current understanding of the geochemical conditions as indicators of
past and present groundwater flow and mixing&quot;</I>.  Cumbria County Council
has deferred making a decision on this application.

<P><B>Geochemical information used to define groundwater regimes</B>
</P>
<P>9.10 This issue is addressed in section 8 of this supplementary proof in
<A HREF="#Para8.7">paragraphs 8.7</A> to 8.10.
</P>
<P><B>The saline transition zone and groundwater mixing in the PRZ</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 In paragraph 6.5.5 of PE/CCC/4, Professor
Mather indicates that the saline transition zone in the PRZ is not sharp and
goes on to argue that this is
<I>&quot;clear evidence to support an upward flow from the BVG into the SSG in
the area of the PRZ&quot;</I>.  The following paragraphs 9.12 to 9.20 establish
that the saline transition zone is relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram
and basal sandstones, which may be the result of the proximity to relatively
high permeability contrasts between the sandstones and the Brockram.
</P>
<P>9.12 In paragraph 6.5.5 (PE/CCC/4), Professor Mather questions the statement
made in my proof of evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para6.67">paragraphs
6.67</A>) that the saline interface zone is relatively sharp in the PRZ.  He
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However, this is only because of the arbitrary definition of the
transition zone as the range over which the electrical conductivity of the
groundwater changes from less than 10 to over 17 mS cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (at 20&#176;
C) (see paragraph 3.2 of {Nirex Science Report S/95/008}).&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.13 Reference to paragraph 3.2 in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] indicates
that the statement made was:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The transition from brackish waters to saline waters is known as
the saline transition zone (STZ) and has been defined as the depth range over
which the electrical conductivity of the groundwater changes from less than 10
to over 17 mS/cm (at 20&#176; C).  The upper value is equivalent to 10 g/l of
total dissolved solids or about 6 g/l chloride.  Definitions of fresh and
increasingly saline waters are given in the glossary.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.14 The glossary in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] on page G2 states the
definitions used for fresh, brackish, and saline waters, and brines.  It is
stated that these definitions are based on the published work of Davis (1964)
and Carpenter (1978).  Thus, the definitions of salinity used by Nirex are
certainly not arbitrary and are based on standard texts.
</P>
<P>9.15 This interpretation of the salinity distribution at Sellafield is
presented in section 3 of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  The summary, as
given in paragraph 3.10 on page 16 states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;A unified representation of the saline transition zone and other
salinity variations across the site has been achieved and is presented.  The
saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is relatively sharp and
occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones.  This is possibly the result of
proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts between the sandstones
and Brockram in the locality.  To the south and west of the Potential Repository
Zone, the saline transition zone is more diffuse.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.16 The pattern of salinity in the upper part of the BVG is consistent with
the current understanding of the site, which suggests that, in the boreholes
drilled in the PRZ, zones of slightly higher hydraulic conductivity are
indicated  in the upper part of the BVG as compared with deeper BVG.
</P>
<P>9.17 Professor Mather uses his Figure 3 (page 32 of PE/CCC/4) and states
that this <I>&quot;proves how spectacularly wrong&quot;</I> Nirex were in
refuting his earlier suggestions of estimates of upward flow made in ERM  Report
ITA/7 [COR/608].  Professor Mather's Figure 3 is a reproduction of Figure 3.1 in
Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525].  Professor Mather does not point out that the
original figure was labelled as a &quot;Composite plot of Cl concentration vs.
depth for the PRZ&quot; and that it contained data from a total of nine separate
boreholes.  He also does not point out that the plots for the individual
boreholes are contained in Appendix C to the same report (S/95/008 [COR/525]).
Professor Mather is overemphasising the implications of salinity levels in
excess of 20 mg/l being observed in the base of the sandstones by not placing
these observations in context.
</P>
<P>9.18 The observations of high salinities in the lower part of the St Bees
Sandstone referred to in paragraph 6.5.6 of Professor Mather's evidence
(PE/CCC/4) are based on a limited number of samples.  The samples showing high
salinities are obtained from the North Head Member at the base of the St Bees
Sandstone.  The chloride versus depth profiles for the individual boreholes in
Appendix C of Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] shows how these individual samples
relate to the interpreted position of the saline transition zone in each of
these boreholes.  Examination of the information presented by Nirex indicates
that over substantial parts of the PRZ, the saline transition zone is sharp, but
is actually located within the North Head Member of the St Bees Sandstone rather
than at the top of the BVG or within the Brockram. The interpretation of this
information presented in Nirex Report S/95/008 [COR/525] is that 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;the saline transition zone in the Potential Repository Zone is
relatively sharp and occurs in the Brockram and basal sandstones. This is
possibly the result of proximity to the relatively high permeability contrasts
between the sandstones and Brockram in the locality.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.19 As discussed previously, (<A HREF="#Para8.32">paragraphs 8.32</A>),
the inferences drawn in Nirex Report S/95/007 [COR/524] are that the North Head
Member has distinctive geological and hydrogeological properties from the
overlying St Bees Sandstone and is considered to be a possible low permeability
control on flow between the North Head Member and the overlying sandstones. The
conclusion is therefore that the North Head Member contributes to the
permeability contrast between the upper stratigraphic units of the sandstone and
the lower formations, and hence the saline transition zone in the PRZ exists in
part within the North Head Member.
</P>
<P>9.20 Detailed examination of the hydrochemical data, in conjunction with
other evidence presented by Nirex therefore indicates that it is inappropriate
for Professor Mather to conclude that the observed salinity profiles are
indicators of significant upwards flow.  At present, although the existence of a
groundwater mixing profile is evident, it is not possible to use the geochemical
data alone to speculate about the extent of this mixing.  Further data, from the
RCF Phase 1 work, are considered essential to quantify this rigorously.
</P>
<P><B>Geochemical indicators of residence times have been over-interpreted</B>
</P>
<P>9.21 In paragraph 6.5.10 on page 35 of PE/CCC/4, Professor Mather states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is my view that the noble gas data are over-interpreted&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.22 Professor Mather makes other comments in section 6.5 of his evidence

<BLOCKQUOTE>

are quoted as mean residence times.  A range of sample types are analysed,
including core pore fluids and fluids sampled during well testing (<A

The majority of samples analysed for groundwater residence indicators are those
taken from well testing in the boreholes. These sample the flow system around
the borehole. In the BVG, these samples are dominated by flow from the fracture
system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;It is possible that rates of regional flows of subsurface waters
in the future could be much more rapid than any inferred today.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.28 This statement is made on the basis that Dr Haszeldine suggests in
section 10 of his evidence that data for hydrogen and oxygen isotope and noble

greater than its present value.

Nirex's interpretation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios and noble gas
recharge temperatures for Boreholes 2, 4 and 5, by equating cold climates with
glaciation.  He assumes that the observed hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios
and low noble gas recharge temperatures indicate that groundwater was recharged
under glacial conditions.  Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.3, page 26,
COR/525) refers only to <I>&quot;colder climatic conditions during the

periods during the past 1.6 million years (i.e. the Pleistocene) were
interspersed with warm periods, giving the impression that warm (temperate)
climate states were common in the Pleistocene.  In fact, the dominant climate
states were colder than today's temperate climate, but only rarely glacial (see
Table on page 22 of Nirex Report S/95/003 [COR/527]).
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>9.31 In paragraph 10.2 (page 26, PE/GNP/3) Dr Haszeldine asserts that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;it is apparent that there is little evidence for water recharge
into the BVG in warm period climates, such as today&quot;.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.32 He then goes on to argue that recharge to the BVG may have been
restricted to colder (i.e. glacial) periods, and presents a cartoon in Figure
10.2 of PE/GNP/3 that suggests that this was due both to increased heads under
the ice and to opening of fractures due to ice loading.  This is how he makes
the connection between the stable isotope data and the idea that the BVG
permeability (<I>&quot;transmissivities&quot;</I>)  may have been higher during
past glaciations.
</P>
<P>9.33 His own evidence (paragraph 11.4, page 29, PE/GNP/3) emphasises his
view regarding the effect of mixing on isotopic indicators of groundwater age,
and stable isotopes are no exception.  If the Nirex view that temperate climate
conditions were the exception rather than the rule in the Pleistocene is
accepted (see paragraph 9.30 above), we would not expect to find spatially
distinct groundwater zones with stable isotopic signatures of temperate recharge
events pre-dating the last (late Devensian) glaciation, as Dr Haszeldine seems
to expect.
</P>
<P>9.34 In fact, isotopically heavy water characterises the brine in the BVG in
Borehole 3.  In Nirex Report S/95/008 (paragraph 5.8, page 28, [COR/525]), it is
said that this <I>&quot;might indicate recharge prior to the last glacial epoch&quot;</I>
i.e. before the Pleistocene, possibly associated with Tertiary tectonic events.
</P>
<P>9.35 Thus there is no evidence, only speculation by Dr Haszeldine that there
was preferential and enhanced recharge to the BVG during glacial periods.

<P>10.1 The need to establish the baseline hydrogeological conditions at the
site prior to commencement of the construction of the RCF is not in dispute. 
The point of disagreement between Nirex and the Objectors is the extent to which
this baseline has been established and, therefore, whether any further
monitoring, sampling or testing is required to establish this baseline.
</P>
<P>10.2 The matters related to baseline conditions were addressed in

</P>
<P><B>Groundwater Heads</B>
</P>
<P>10.3 The Objectors state that additional periods of time are required.  For
example Dr Salmon (paragraph 5.5, page 49, PE/FOE/5) states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;I consider that it would be a sensible precaution to define
baseline conditions as being established when relatively stable or predictable
heads and geochemistry has been observed over a period of four or five years at
all monitoring points.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.4 Mr Reeves (paragraph 8.5, page 42, PE/FOE/4) states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;This network should be monitored for a minimum of a further 4 or 5
calendar years to enable an equilibrium condition database to be established
over an adequate time frame.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.5 Similar views are stated by Drs Green and Western (PE/FOE/1, paragraph
9.7).
</P>
<P>10.6 The Nirex position, as stated in <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#Appendix2">Appendix
2</A> of my evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) is that baseline conditions are already
recognisable in all boreholes as shown by constant head with time or systematic
seasonal variations (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph B.2.16</A>,
Appendix 2, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).  It has been further pointed out that monitoring
will continue and further baseline data will become available prior to
commencement of shaft excavation (a further 2 years approximately).  A review of
baseline conditions carried out for Nirex in September 1995 by Professor Lloyd,
(Professor of Hydrogeology, University of Birmingham) has confirmed the Nirex
view that baseline has been established [NRX/14/3].

<P>10.7 In its report &quot;Review of aspects of the scientific mission and
role of the Nirex Rock Characterisation Facility at Sellafield&quot; [COR/414]

groundwater monitoring should be carried out subsequent to cessation of drilling

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.11 These issues are discussed in turn below.
</P>
<P><U>Data availability</U>
</P>
<P>10.12 At paragraph 7.7 (page 31, PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves comments on the extent
of the data available in the sandstones and drift.  He is incorrect in his
assertions concerning the limited amount of data.  There are 16 boreholes with
data from 1974 and there are at least 17 drift boreholes with more than 9 years
of data {Nirex Report 233, Table 2.11}.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.13"></A>10.13 In the early 1980s extensive investigations
into the water resources of west Cumbria were conducted by the North West Water
Authority, and subsequently by BNFL.  As a results of this there are 41
observation wells with more than 10 years records, and 24 observation wells with
more than 5 years records.  The results of 13 aquifer pumping tests are
available from this investigation, which included monitoring the effects of the
development on water levels in the Drift, and on flows from springs and in the
River Calder {Nirex Report 233, Table 3.2}.  It is noted that the hydrographs
presented by Mr Reeves from Cumbria (Figure 5, PE/FOE/4) display substantially
the same pattern of water levels as the hydrograph he presents for Shropshire
(Figure 1, PE/FOE/4), except the 1976 drought was less intense in coastal
Cumbria than it was in the Midlands.  This demonstrates that the Cumbria
hydrographs are comparable to the national trends in water level changes.
</P>
<P>10.14 As part of the development of nuclear facilities in the area,
investigations of the relationships between water levels in the drift and
underlying sandstone were conducted at Drigg and Sellafield.  Professor Mather
refers to the Sellafield investigations in CCC/4/3.
</P>
<P>10.15 The above data show that the investigations of groundwater conditions
in west Cumbria, although not performed specifically in connection with the
Nirex work, were of a duration and intensity that bears comparison with
investigations for groundwater schemes elsewhere in the UK and is greater than
suggested by Mr Reeves.
</P>
<P><U>Comparison with regional groundwater schemes</U>
</P>
<P>10.16 In section 5 of his evidence (PE/FOE/4), Mr Reeves draws comparisons
between the Nirex data acquisition programme, and a number of data acquisition
programmes associated with different projects.  In particular, three groundwater
schemes are cited: Thames, Shropshire and the Fylde, the latter two exploiting
the Sherwood Sandstone Group, as found at Sellafield.  All three of these
schemes are very large, designed to impact water resources on a regional or
national scale.  They involve groundwater abstractions rather larger than the
total flow of the River Calder in west Cumbria.  The likely scale of impact can
be expected to be much greater than the groundwater impact of the RCF, yet it
can be seen that the number of observation wells and the timescale of
observations are in fact similar to those for the Sellafield area, as described
above.
</P>
<P>10.17 Thus compared with other investigations of comparable scale, Nirex has
a comparable amount of data from many of its monitoring installations.  As
stated in my evidence (Appendix 2, <A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.16">paragraph
B.2.16</A>-17, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>) the baseline has been established and a
further two years of monitoring will be available before excavation of the RCF
South Shaft is due to commence.  As far as we are aware, there is no tradition
of requiring five years data from specially installed monitoring.
</P>
<P><U>Objectives and Duration of monitoring</U>
</P>
<P>10.18 Natural systems are seldom static, but exist in a state of
fluctuation.  The objective of monitoring over a period of time, rather than
taking just a single measurement, is to characterise this fluctuation with time.
</P>
<P>10.19 Natural changes to groundwater systems occur over a complete spectrum
of timescales.  As described in Appendix 2 of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> (<A
HREF="nrx14a1.htm#ParaB2.11">paragraph B.2.11</A> to B.2.15  on pages B.5 and
B.6), Nirex has already characterised gravitational effects (occurring on cycles
of 12 hours 25 minutes), barometric effects (24 hours to several days), seasonal
effects (1 year), synoptic effects (occurring over several years) and has
possibly identified solar effects (22 years).  In addition, there is evidence
for long-term synoptic effects (about 50 year cycles), climatic effects (100
years to 100,000 years), and tectonic effects (100,000 years plus), all of which
are applicable on a much larger scale than just west Cumbria.
</P>
<P>10.20 Given this continuous spectrum, there is no clear point at which to
stop monitoring and it is therefore necessary to form a judgement as to what is
sufficient.  Some fluctuations can be directly measured and determined on a site
specific basis, others, such as, for example, climatic effects and tectonic
effects must be established by other means and the uncertainties associated with
such estimates taken account of in the safety assessments of the site.
</P>
<P>10.21 There are two clear uses for the variability recorded in long-term
monitoring data:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the characteristics of the variations can be interpreted in
terms of the hydrogeological properties of the site; and
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="5">ii.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">the natural variability needs to be subtracted from
artificially induced changes, such as pump testing and the drawdown caused by
RCF shaft excavation, in order to measure correctly the size of these changes.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>10.22 In terms of hydrogeological properties it can be shown by
consideration of the diffusion equation that longer timescale fluctuations
directly increase information on hydraulic conductivity.  In progressing from
daily fluctuations to annual fluctuations there is a significant gain in
information of around 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas further progress to
short-term synoptic fluctuations gives a further increase of only a further 0.5
orders of magnitude.  In order to characterise cyclic fluctuations, it is
necessary to observe one cycle if the period is known, rather more cycles if it
is unknown.
</P>
<P>10.23 In terms of correcting observations for natural fluctuations, if the
fluctuations have been explained in terms of hydrogeological properties, the
corrections can be made on this basis alone.  Otherwise, it will be necessary to
measure the natural fluctuations in their own right.  It is helpful if the trend
can be correlated with trends in boreholes independent of the imposed
disturbance.  For the longer term effects, which are of more than local
significance, the correlation boreholes need not be local.  The good correlation
of water levels between Cumbria and Shropshire (<A HREF="#Para10.13">paragraphs
10.13</A> above) is an example of this.
</P>
<P>10.24 Mr Reeves' assertion that at least five years' data are necessary can
be examined in the light of the above discussion.  Five years' data are clearly
more than adequate to characterise fluctuations up to the scale of annual
fluctuations.  Nearly all the likely information on hydrogeological properties
can be extracted from annual fluctuations.  Five years' data are inadequate to
characterise synoptic variations; this can be seen clearly by moving a five year
window over the hydrographs presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 1 and 5 in
PE/FOE/4).  To characterise such variations, of the order of twenty years' data
are required.  However, this yields little extra hydrogeological information,
and the trends within this can be characterised by less than five years' data. 
Correlations with other boreholes can also be used.
</P>
<P>10.25 It is also relevant to consider the use that can be made of long-term
monitoring data, for example that presented by Mr Reeves (Figures 8 and 9 in
Appendix 1 to PE/FOE/4).  Figure 9 shows a fairly consistent mean head, about
which annual fluctuations occur.  The only major excursion is in 1988.  The long
record has increased confidence that there are no long-term trends in this
dataset, but has added little information beyond that captured by the first one
or two years' data.  The hydrograph in Figure 8 (Appendix 1, PE/FOE/4) shows the
impact of shaft sinking followed by an almost straight line recovery onto which
is superimposed the annual fluctuations.  These annual fluctuations are rather
larger than in Figure 9.  The excursion in 1988 is clearly visible.  The record
prior to shaft sinking is only about 6 months in duration in Figure 8 and is too
short to establish whether the amplitude of annual fluctuations has been changed
by the shaft sinking.  However, it is not clear that the long record of data
post-sinking has added much information over that gained in the first one or two
years.
</P>
<P><U>Conclusion</U>
</P>
<P>10.26 The baseline groundwater conditions have been established at
Sellafield.  A further two years of monitoring will be available before
commencement of the RCF South Shaft excavation commences.  There is no
justification for the arbitrary assertions by Dr Salmon and Mr Reeves that a
further 4 or 5 years of monitoring is required before commencement of the RCF.

<P><B>Geochemical Conditions</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;The lack of a programme of boreholes drilled specifically to

<P><I>&quot;Many aspects of the geochemistry of the site as it stands are
currently poorly understood.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>10.29 However, he does not go on to say what these are or why he believes
they are poorly understood.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.30"></A>10.30 These witnesses call into question whether
sufficient geochemical information has been collected prior to RCF excavation. 
In the following section I explain why baseline hydrochemical information is
only required for certain purposes, why sufficient geochemical information, of
sufficient quality, is already available for these purposes and why further
planned work to improve the baseline will be unaffected by the excavation of the
RCF.  I also explain why the RCF offers the only means to obtain baseline
hydrochemical data relevant for other purposes.
</P>
<P><U>Objective of Hydrochemical Observations</U>
</P>
<P>10.31 Hydrogeochemical baseline information is required at the current stage
of investigations principally to assist with the development of the regional
groundwater flow model. The main components of the hydrogeochemical data used to
do this have been salinity and other major chemical component data (to help
identify the processes leading to the distribution of the main bodies of water
present) and isotopic data (which give indications of origins and movement of
these waters; so-called palaeohydrogeological information).
</P>
<P>10.32 At later stages in the programme, requirements for hydrogeochemical
data will become more specific in terms of targetting hydrogeological features
or regions of interest or in terms of evaluating specific mechanisms and
pathways.
</P>
<P><U>Data used in Current Regional Model</U>
</P>
<P>10.33 The principal source of data used to draw the current hydrogeochemical
baseline has been water samples taken from cores and during hydraulic testing of
the deep boreholes. These samples were all contaminated to varying extents by
drilling fluids but it has been possible to make analytical corrections to
provide good quality data which are 'fit for purpose'. This is described in
detail in Appendix 2 (<A HREF="nrx14a1.htm#B3">B.3</A>) of my Proof of Evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>) and the views of the Royal Society Study Group on data
quality were stated earlier, at

(currently, boreholes 15-18 into the sandstones), in which collection of
hydrochemical data takes precedence over other measurements, are planned to
enhance understanding in volumes of rock where the conceptual regional
hydrogeological model is sensitive. These may include the saline transition
zone, other regions of groundwater mixing and discharge zones.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para10.37"></A>10.37 Continued sampling of existing and planned
deep boreholes will provide progressively less contaminated samples for isotopic
analysis which will enable the construction of a model of regional
palaeohydrogeology. This will considerably strengthen the regional flow model.
At present, this work is in its early stages.

<P>10.38 Sampling of entirely undisturbed conditions within the PRZ will not be
possible after construction. However, this is not considered to be a significant
issue for the following reasons:

<TD WIDTH="800">A baseline of 'major variables' for the region as a whole,
including the PRZ, already exists. This is adequate for constructing the current
regional flow model (as discussed above). In this context, hydrochemical data
from the PRZ are simply one point in the much broader regional picture which can
be built even without data from the PRZ itself.

<TD WIDTH="800">Very detailed hydrochemical characterisation of undisturbed PRZ
groundwaters with a view to evaluation of their impact on the proposed
repository system is of limited relevance as the actual behaviour of the
repository near-field hydrochemistry will be dominated by the presence of the
repository excavations themselves (to which the RCF is analogous).  In
particular, the evolution of pore-waters in the cementitious engineered barriers
and the wastes and the interactions of the consequent chemical 'plume' with the
rock will need to be demonstrably understood. Monitoring of the hydrochemical
disturbance caused by the excavations,such as the RCF, is of considerably
greater significance in evaluating the future behaviour of the PRZ than is
information on its undisturbed state.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><A NAME="Para10.39"></A>10.39 In addition to these points it must be
stressed that the RCF offers the only practical means to collect other

<TD WIDTH="800">Collection and long-term monitoring of inflows to the shafts
and galleries of the RCF as drawdown proceeds using specially designed sample
installations which penetrate a few metres out from the excavation disturbed
zone will provide high-quality uncontaminated samples from zones of rock or
specific features which are intersected. Monitoring of changes in water
composition of more transmissive features/regions as the drawdown progresses
will provide valuable information on flow patterns in the PRZ region. This
latter approach has been used successfully to study the impacts of major
fractures on flow and deep hydrochemistry in the &Auml;sp&ouml; underground
research laboratory in Sweden.

neighbouring volumes of rock in the BVG via sub-horizontal boreholes drilled out
into the surrounding rock. It is expected that hydrogeochemical conditions
analogous to those existing prior to disturbance by the RCF will be encountered.
It must also be borne in mind that the response time of the hydrogeochemistry to
drawdown and excavation will vary depending on the hydraulic properties of the
rock or of the feature intersected. Low transmissivity parts of the deep BVG are
expected to remain essentially unaffected chemically and be accessible for
sampling for a considerable period.

</P>
<P><B>Extent of Nirex Investigations</B>
</P>
<P>11.6 Nirex has initiated studies to evaluate the nature of the tectonic and
seismic disturbance which could affect a repository at Sellafield in accordance
with international guidelines (<A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para7.21">paragraph 7.21</A>,
page 57, <B>PE/NRX/14</B>).
</P>
<P>11.7 Nirex is adopting a balanced and scientific approach to evaluating
seismicity and any associated hazard in which the scientific evidence is
assessed and subjected to wide and critical review before incorporation into our
performance assessments of the site.  We are currently obtaining reviews of
aspects of the seismicity studies from two international experts in line with
the recommendations of the Royal Society Study Group contained on page 160 of
their report [COR/605] that the work should be exposed to the widest possible
international peer review.
</P>
<P>11.8 Nirex has recently published a four volume report on the seismological
database for Sellafield {Nirex Report SA/95/003} which is referred to in

<P>11.9 In paragraph 7.2 of his evidence (PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine comments on
the map presented by Nirex as Figure 6.2 in Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524
[COR/517].  Dr Haszeldine makes the comment:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In terms of possible uplift, the most important part of this map
is the abrupt change in the orientation of uplift contours as they cross a line
running sub-parallel to the present coastline.  The only way to resolve these
changes of contour direction, is to infer that a discontinuity has occurred
between the two sets of rocks, i.e. that a fault has been active sometime during
the last 60Ma.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.10 Nirex has presented evidence (Nirex Report 524, Volume 1, page 38
[COR/517]) in its published discussion of Figure 6.2 that:-

<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="800">The change in the orientation of the contours of uplift across
the Lake District Boundary Fault Zone in south Cumbria is largely an artefact of

<TD WIDTH="800">Faulting that has been active during the past 60 million years

uplift contours.  Expulsion of warm mineralised fluids at the basin margin is a
more likely explanation for locally enhanced values of apparent uplift - and the
process is as proposed by Dr Haszeldine and others for the origin of the
hematite ore bodies of the south Cumbria area.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>11.11 Nevertheless, Dr Haszeldine associates this apparent discontinuity
with the Lake District Boundary Fault, comments that this structure is an
extensional fault and, subsequently, (paragraphs 7.5 to 7.7, PE/GNP/3) draws an
association between extensional faulting and groundwater expulsion.
</P>
<P>11.12 The evidence for regional uplift in the Lake District is not disputed.
 Nirex has presented this information in a number of reports.  However, Dr
Haszeldine fails to make the point that uplift occurred everywhere else in
Britain.  Section 6.1.4 of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] on page 37
states:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Uplift at about the Cretaceous-Tertiary is ubiquitous in Britain.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.13 Dr Haszeldine also fails to recognise that this latest period of
movement on the Lake District Boundary Fault, would not have been extensional,
as he implies, but compressional.  This is explained on page 38 of Volume 1 of
Nirex Report 524 [COR/517] where it is stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Further evidence of basin inversion superimposed upon a broad,
regional uplift is provided by the seismic reflection data with examples of
fault reversal and local anticlinal folding.  Compression, orientated roughly
N-, is consistent with the fact that NE-trending structures, such as the
Maryport and Lagman faults, were preferentially reversed.  This resulted in
inversion of the Solway Firth Basin and northern part of the Langman Basin which
appear to have been buttressed against the Ramsay-Whitehaven Ridge.  In the
vicinity of Sellafield, any displacements on the LDBFZ would have been markedly
transpressional.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.14 The 'LDBFZ' is the Lake District Boundary Fault Zone. 
'Transpressional, as stated in the Glossary of Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524
[COR/517] means <I>&quot;Action of compressive stress oblique to the trend of a
fault.  Results in oblique-reverse displacement of the fault.&quot;</I>  In
other words, it is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.15 Thus, Dr Haszeldine is being somewhat misleading in stating that the
Lake District Boundary Fault is an extensional fault.  Whilst it formed
originally in an extensional regime, it latest movements were not extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Features within the glacial sediments</B>
</P>
<P>11.16 Nirex is investigating possible neotectonic features and attempting to
distinguish such evidence from the relatively common glacitectonic structural
features due to internal deformation of the Quaternary by the movement across it
of ice sheets.  These have produced compressional and extensional dislocations. 
The section in Volume 1 of Nirex Report 524 (page 11) [COR/517] to which Dr
Haszeldine may be referring in paragraph 7.4 (page 18, PE/GNP/3) is
comprehensive and sufficient to show that we are addressing the subject and it
is not a major omission as he claims:-
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>&quot;2.5 Neotectonics and seismic hazard</B></I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Since the preparation of Nirex Report Number 263, there have been
further investigations of seismological, geophysical, geological and remotely
sensed features, to determine whether they may indicate neotectonic activity. 
In particular, potentially faulted offsets of rockhead and Quaternary sediments
have been interpreted from onshore and offshore seismic reflection data.  No
firm field evidence of neotectonic activity has been found in the onshore
district although sites which might be the most likely to reveal such evidence
have been identified for further study.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Tectonic Regime in the UK</B>
</P>
<P>11.17 Dr Haszeldine states in paragraph 7.7 (PE/GNP/3) that Britain is in an
extensional regime.  He is incorrect in this assertion.  His mistake may have
arisen from misleading statements in the references he quotes (GNP/3/7 and
GOV/613).
</P>
<P>11.18 In the 1992 HMIP Report (page 30, section 2.7.2, British Earthquakes,
paragraph 1 [GOV/613]), Dr Muir Wood is initially definitive that Britain, in
contrast to other intraplate regions, is in an extensional regime but, on
refering to section 3, the evidence for extension is admitted to be minor with
evidence for strike-slip faulting predominant (page 63, section 3.2.5
[GOV/613]).  More specifically, for western Britain, including the Sellafield
area, it is accepted that the regime is not extensional.
</P>
<P>11.19 By the early 1990's, observations of present day stress fields by
earthquake focal mechanism studies, <I>in situ</I> stress measurements and
borehole break-out analyses had shown that the European stress state was
generally not extensional, but in a similar compressional state to other
intraplate areas.  In a summary paper on &quot;Regional Patterns of Tectonic
Stress in Europe&quot;, Muller <I>et al</I>, 1992 (Figure 3, page 11,787
[NRX/14/6]) provided maps of stress indicators.  On a generalised stress map 
they classified these as compressional or extensional.  <I>&quot;Inward
directed arrows indicate the maximum horizontal compression directions in
regions of dominantly compressive stress regimes (either thrust or strike-slip
faulting).  Outward directed arrows indicate the least horizontal stress in
regions of extension.&quot;</I>  Areas of dominant extension were only present
in Italy, Greece and Turkey.  All other areas were dominantly compressional,
with a limited number of local extensional zones as in the Rhine graben and in
uplift zones following melting of thick ice sheets. Even basins formed in an
extensional regime, such as the North Sea, were generally in a situation of
present-day compression.  All but two of the many stress indicators in Britain
were compressional.  One of these extensional indicators was in eastern England
near the Wash, the other was in the SW Scottish Highlands, in the area of
maximum ice load during the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>11.20 In the HMIP report [GOV/613] reference is made to an article (King,
page 90) on fault plane solutions for the 1979 Carlisle earthquake.  This was
not discussed in detail but is relevant to Sellafield as the nearest earthquake
of moderate size that had been instrumentally monitored in detail and results
analysed to determine the stress pattern.  One mechanism was thrust/reverse
faulting, the other mainly strike-slip, i.e. neither were extensional.  King
favoured the reverse faulting solution but later more detailed analysis by the
BGS {SA/95/003}, including the aftershock data, preferred an oblique strike slip
mechanism.
</P>
<P>11.21 Subsequently, as part of the Nirex Seismic Hazard Assessment,
[SA/95/003], the data for the 1979 Carlisle (Longtown) earthquake were
re-analysed and confirmed the strike slip solution.  Additionally, analysis of
the 1993 Grange-over-Sands earthquake, at 3.0 M<SUB>L</SUB> the largest
earthquake recorded by the BNFL/Nirex monitoring and the closest earthquake of
moderate size to Sellafield, indicated strike-slip with a small component of
reverse movement.  Such a mechanism was found to generally apply to the great
majority of earthquake fault plane solutions in the area.  Pure reverse or
normal faulting is minor and associated with the smaller earthquakes.  It was
noted ([11] p 48 paragraph 2) that:<I> &quot;At or above this magnitude (3M<SUB>L</SUB>),
focal mechanisms elsewhere in Britain invariably appear to be strike-slip&quot;</I>.
</P>
<P>11.22 Therefore, earthquake analysis confirms that the stress regime at
seismogenic depth in the Sellafield area is not extensional but generally
strike-slip and similar to that in the majority of Britain and north-west
Europe.  Thus, Dr Haszeldine is incorrect in stating that the tectonic regime in
Britain is extensional.
</P>
<P><B>Effect of Earthquakes on Groundwater</B>
</P>
<P>11.23 Dr Haszeldine (paragraph 7.5, PE/GNP/3) states that earthquakes can
pump water to the surface as a consequence of their aftermath.  He quotes
information from GNP/3/7 in support of his statements.  He then extends his
argument to the UK quoting information from GOV/613 in his paragraph 7.7.
</P>
<P>11.24 In the 1992 DoE/HMIP Report [GOV/613], Muir Wood and Woo suggest that
normal fault earthquakes can have a major effect on groundwater whereas reverse
fault earthquakes do not produce significant effects.  Strike-slip earthquakes
were found to produce a variety of responses and this was considered to be due
to the associated component of normal or reverse faulting.
</P>
<P>11.25 The relevant extract for strike-slip earthquakes is (page 16
[GOV/613]):

<P><I>2.4.1 General remarks</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>As might be predicted from the findings concerning normal and reverse
fault earthquakes, strike-slip fault displacements are found to cause a
diversity of responses.  Many strike-slip faults are accompanied by some
component of normal or reverse displacement, and it is evident that this can be
of particular importance in dictating the resulting hydrological signatures.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.26 Dr Haszeldine draws an analogy in paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3)
between the reported effects of the 1959 Hegben Lake earthquake and the 1983
Borah Peak earthquake.  His diagrams (7.5 and 7.6) both, however, refer to the
Hegben Lake event.  He does not mention that both events were large earthquakes
on normal faults in an extensional regime and were therefore not analogues for
potential effects at Sellafield.  Section 2.2 on page 5 of  GOV/613 is headed &quot;Normal
Fault Earthquakes&quot; and contains the quote:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;In the past 35 years there have been three major onland normal
fault earthquakes in countries with a well developed programme of
hydrogeological monitoring:  the two most recent large normal fault earthquakes
in the USA (the 1959/8/17 Hebgen Lake earthquake (M7.3) in Montana, and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
7.0 1983/10/28 Borah Peak earthquake 250 km away in Idaho), and the M<SUB>s</SUB>
6.9 1980/11/23 earthquake in southern Italy.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Hydrogeological effects of UK Earthquakes</B>
</P>
<P>11.27 Reference to <A HREF="nrx14.htm#Para7.14">paragraphs 7.14</A> to 7.25
of <B>PE/NRX/14</B> indicates that the seismicity of the UK is low and that
over the last few hundred years has only been subjected to moderate or small
earthquakes (up to about magnitude 5.5).  Thus, it is scientifically
questionable to suggest that the effects of a magnitude 7.3 earthquake can be
realistically mapped onto Cumbria in the way that Dr Haszeldine has sought to do
in his Figures 7.5 and 7.6 (PE/GNP/3).
</P>
<P>11.28 Dr Muir Wood and G Woo in a 1992 report for DoE/HMIP [GOV/613] stated
in the abstract that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Britain is shown to be a slowly deforming region of active crustal
extension, in which increases in springflow and rises in the water-table have
been noted following even relatively small earthquakes of the past 150 years. 
Hence earthquake-induced changes in hydrology will need to be accounted for in
estimating the performance of proposed British radioactive waste repositories.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.29 They applied their analysis to the Sellafield site and concluded that
([GOV/613], page 79, section 4.5.1, paragraph 5):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Hence there are tectonic arguments for suspecting that faults of
the LDBFZ may currently be active.  The hydrological signature of the 1865
Rampside earthquake provides further corroboration that at least some faults of
this system are liable to undergo shallow normal fault displacements.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and that (page 80):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;However current evidence suggests that the fault-bounded West
Cumbrian coast may be tectonically active, and that seismic pumping of
groundwater may occur around Sellafield.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>11.30 As Britain is not in an extensional regime, the claimed mechanism for
significant hydrogeological effects predicted by Dr Muir Wood's hypothesis will
not apply.  The examples he presents, [GOV/613] Appendix B, of British
earthquakes that affected the hydrogeological regime are:

Chalk rose by up to 7.5 feet in wells to 420 feet depths over periods up to 40
days following the earthquake.  The majority of changes in water level were
rises but the level fell in one well.  The widespread nature of the changes
probably does reflect earthquake strain effects on the fissured Chalk aquifer. 
The Colchester earthquake was in SE England adjacent to the southern North Sea
basin and so there could be an extensional component to the local stress regime.
 Therefore the changes to the local water table following the Colchester
earthquake probably indicate effects that would not apply to the Sellafield
area.
</P>
<P><U>Recent Review of earthquake effects on groundwater</U>
</P>
<P>11.34 A recent study (Rojstaczer, Wolf and Michel; Nature, 373, pages
237-239, 1995) has concluded that earthquakes do not expel water from depths of
several kilometres.  Instead earthquakes can cause near-surface permeability
enhancements that produce persistent and widespread changes to the groundwater. 
These include changes to the water table and groundwater outflow to streams. 
Measurement of the groundwater chemistry after earthquakes in California showed
that near surface water was involved in changes to the stream and spring flow.
</P>
<P>11.35 Inferred changes to the permeability were about one order of
magnitude.  Measurements of the permeability of all the hydrogeological units at
Sellafield have indicated a range of values over several orders of magnitude. 
Modelling of the groundwater pathway for the post-closure performance assessment
(Nirex 95 [COR/522]) has used a range of permeability values.  A general
increase of one order of magnitude in the average near surface permeability was
not found to produce significantly different results.
</P>

<P>11.37 Dr Haszeldine, by selectively quoting information from a limited
number of sources has sought to draw conclusions about the tectonics of the
Sellafield area and concerning possible impacts of earthquakes on the
hydrogeology of the area.  In doing this he has failed to take account of the
published information and has misrepresented information, for example, by
seeking to draw a comparison between large, normal fault earthquakes in the USA
and small earthquakes in the UK in a compressional stress regime.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Comparisons"></A><B>12. COMPARISONS WITH INVESTIGATION PRACTICES
ELSEWHERE.</B></P>
<P><B>Comparisons with the Oil Industry</B>
</P>
<P>12.1 Several Objectors' proofs draw comparisons between the Nirex
investigations and the practices adopted within the oil industry.  Dr Haszeldine
(PE/GNP/3, section 6, pages 15-17) draws comparisons in terms of timescale and
approach. A similar theme relating to approach to investigations is picked up by
Professor Smythe (PE/FOE/3, paragraph 7.14).
</P>
<P>12.2 Professor Smythe and Dr Haszeldine both seek to criticise the Nirex
approach to investigations claiming that it does not follow oil company practice
which they regard as a model for Nirex to emulate (PE/FOE/3, paragraphs 7.14 and
9.6; PE/GNP/3, paragraph 6.3).
</P>
<P>12.3 The first point that must be made is that Nirex is not exploring to
identify and exploit an oil deposit.  The oil industry seeks to locate oil and
gas deposits which are confined to specific locations dependent upon very
specific combinations of geological features and processes.  Nirex, on the other
hand, is exploring a specific location to determine its suitability to host a
repository.  Fluid flow technology for the oil industry tends to be aimed at
high flow rates and high permeability rocks.  Nirex, on the other hand, is
looking primarily at low flow rates in low permeability rocks.  In these
respects, the oil industry is not a direct analogy to the work being undertaken
by Nirex.
</P>
<P>12.4 Nevertheless, the Nirex approach has drawn on a wide range of expertise
and experience from the hydrocarbons industry, notably through such contractors
as British Geological Survey, GeoScience Ltd, J. Arthur and Associates Ltd,
Schlumberger GeoQuest Ltd and others, all with direct experience of working in
the hydrocarbons industry.  Meetings have been held with both Shell and BP to
exchange technical knowledge and experience, and this information exchange
continues.
</P>
<P>12.5 At paragraph 6.7 of his evidence (Pages 16-17, PE/GNP/3), Dr Haszeldine
states that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Choice of site and Planning Application for the RCF could be
considered analogous to deciding to proceed with oil field development in a
particular location.&quot;</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>12.6 The only decision Nirex has made is to apply to construct an RCF.  In
terms of the exploration analogy that Dr Haszeldine persists with, this may be
seen as just another tool for obtaining data and testing predictions analogous
to the change in the hydrocarbons industry from drilling exploration wells to an
appraisal well - it is definitely not analogous to a decision to proceed with
the development of an oil field.  This would be equivalent to commencement of
construction of a repository and first oil would be equivalent to first waste
emplacement in a repository.
</P>
<P>12.7 Dr Haszeldine's presentation of the Nirex programme is wrong (his
Figure 6.7, PE/GNP/3).  He shows the boreholes starting in late 1992.  The
borehole drilling started with Borehole 1 in mid 1989.  The RCF programme
described by Dr Haszeldine is not the same as that presented as
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> in Dr Mellor's
evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>).  Dr Mellor shows the RCF programme commencing in
mid 1996, seven years after the start of drilling as compared to the 15 months
shown by Dr Haszeldine.  Dr Mellor shows the RCF science programme completed in
early 2006; Dr Haszeldine shows it to be completed by the end of 2001.  The
programme shown by Dr Haszeldine for the development of a complex or difficult
oil field concludes with first oil production some 18 years after start of work.
 The equivalent end point for the Nirex programme is first waste emplacement in
a repository.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#Para9.22">paragraph 9.22</A>, page 61) states that
this may be possible in the first half of 2011.  Mr Folger's supplementary proof
(<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12s1.htm#Para4.3">paragraph 4.3</A>, page 8, <B>PE/NRX/12/S1</B>)
presents a revised programme indicating the earliest date for first waste
emplacement as the first half of 2012.  This is 23 years after start of
drilling.  This is longer than the 18 years quoted by Dr Haszeldine for an
oilfield and substantially longer than the 9.25 years he shows in his Figure 6.7
(PE/GNP/3) for the <I>'Nirex drilling plan'</I>.
</P>
<P>12.8 Detailed examination of the Nirex investigation programme reveals close
similarities with the practice in the hydrocarbons industry.  The adoption of a
progressive, step-wise methodology from the regional reconnaissance scale
towards the District and then the Site and finally the PRZ is a clear example.
</P>
<P>12.9 The acquisition of seismic reflection data similarly followed standard
exploration procedures.  Hydrocarbon exploration normally begins with wide
ranging 2-D seismic reflection surveys and exploratory drilling, moving later,
where justified, to development drilling and, in many, but by no means all
cases, to targeted 3-D seismic surveys.

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>

<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.

a repository:</P>

the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are

<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.

Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>

<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts

<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.

<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.

<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK

<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.

<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts

<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.

<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information

</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:

<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White

of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);

<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>

</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule

</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a

<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.

<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several
initiatives in advance of 1994: ...</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><I>UK Nirex Ltd. will speed up its investigations into a potential
underground waste disposal site so that a well-founded proposal can come to a
public inquiry as soon as possible; ... </I>&quot;
</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern

proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>

<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site

<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;

<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved

line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we

<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.
