Most people are aware that outdoor air pollution can damage their health, but they may not know that indoor air pollution can be even more dangerous. The construction of well-sealed buildings with reduced ventilation rates and the use of household cleaners, pesticides, and personal care products all contribute to serious health problems. Studies show indoor air can be eight to ten times more toxic than outdoor air. Equinox Air Filtration Systems reduce the amount of pollutants and potentially hazardous materials we are exposed to whether at home, at work, or in the car, creating a healthier environment for ourselves and our families. All of our air filtration systems are made from superior quality, heavy duty materials and come with an excellent warranty, which is validated when the warranty card is sent in to Equinox.<P>



<font size=+1>EQ-100 Portable Air Filtration System</font><BR>
Designed to be used away from home, the EQ-100 Portable Air Filtration System is ideal for use in vehicles, hotel rooms, or anywhere that indoor air quality is a concern. This compact unit draws polluted air through a highly effective three-stage filtration system and expels clean air in all directions around the circumference of the unit for maximum coverage. The first stage filter removes large dust particles and absorbs noxious fumes and odors. The second stage filter attracts and holds submicron dust particles from the air, and the third stage filter absorbs gaseous contaminants. Two adapters are included with this unit, a 12 volt dc for cars and a 110 or 230 volt ac transformer for indoor use. The EQ-100 Portable Air Filtration System has a one-year pro rata warranty.<P>

<font size=+1>EQ-1000 Tabletop and EQ-2000 Floor Model Air Filtration Systems</font><BR>
These outstanding home filtration systems effectively remove 99.9% of particulate pollution using a three-stage filtration process. In the first stage, a carbon pre-filter helps to eliminate fumes, dust, odors, and smoke. The second stage consists of a 3,000 grade HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter that eliminates pollen, bacteria, mold spores, attached viruses, animal dander, and radon progeny. It is effective on particles down to 0.3 microns in size, which is approximately 250 times smaller than a human hair. Finally, in the third stage, a carbon blanket removes additional chemicals, fumes, and odors. Both units have an external baked powder-coated epoxy steel housing that comes in basic black and off-white.  Equinox provides a one-year pro rata warranty from the date of purchase for complete parts and labor against defects in materials or workmanship and a two-year pro rata warranty on the HEPA filter, providing for normal home or office use.<P>

This unique tropical blend contains various botanicals that have been identified as having properties beneficial to the skin since the 18th century. Hawaiian White Ginger Root Extract and Jaboncillo Extract are used for their superior cleansing ability, and the emollients Bladderwack and Matricaria Extracts are included for their skin soothing abilities. This excellent cleanser produces a rich lather, opens the pores for deep cleaning, and leaves the skin feeling refreshed.<p>

A light spray on the face after cleansing induces the refreshing feeling of the tropics thanks to a unique combination of ten herbs and flowers. Its superior moisturizing properties leave the skin with a wonderfully luxurious feel. For best results, follow with either a daytime or nighttime moisturizer.<p>

<font size=+1>Botanical Facial Scrub</font><br>
A combination of rain forest botanicals and very fine pumice creates a superior cleansing and moisturizing formula. 
Macadamia Nut and Brazil Nut Oils are included to help keep the skin smooth, soft, and healthy looking. 
This is an excellent exfoliation treatment.<p>

This deep cleaning treatment is ideal for skin that has been stressed by environmental conditions. It leaves the skin feeling invigorated and naturally refreshed.<p>

<font size=+1>Daytime Moisturizer With Retinyl A</font><br> 
Some of the richest ingredients found in the rain forest have been combined with Retinyl A Palmitate, a product shown in studies to thicken the epidermis and dermis, increase skin elasticity, and normalize dry, parched skin. Natural extracts such as Matricaria, Calendula, and Yarrow help keep skin looking youthful and healthy. This superb moisturizer is an excellent foundation for makeup and is gentle enough to use every day.<p>

<font size=+1>Night Treatment With Alpha Hydroxy</font><br> 
Five Alpha Hydroxy Acids--Lactic Acid, Sugar Cane Extract, Citrus Extract, Apple Extract, and Green Tea Extract--are included in this outstanding  skin treatment to gently exfoliate the skin.

<font size=+1>Botanical Eye Gel</font><br>
Our naturally rich, glycol-free formula is designed to help protect the very delicate tissue surrounding the eye. This special gel contains Aloe Vera, renowned for its healing properties, and Jaboncillo Extract, which produces a protective film that may help prevent fine lines caused by dryness resulting from exposure to the elements. Extracts of Cucumber, Comfrey, and Witch Hazel make it safe to use every day.<p>

<font size=+1>Rain Forest Resources Skin Care System</font><br>
Equinox has created a skin care system that is absolutely unequaled.

<p>
Cheryl Sullivan, Secretary, Indiana FSSA <br>
<hr>
<p>
The <b>Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) </b> was created in
1991 to strengthen families.  Families are the source of Indiana's rich heritage
and diversity.  They create our neighborhoods and communities.
<p>
Indiana has worked to strengthen the ability of families and individuals to
move toward self-sufficiency.  FSSA was established to be a catalyst in
developing a comprehensive service system that addresses the needs of individuals
and families through prevention, early intervention, and preservation.
<p>
The creation of FSSA brought programs from the former Departments of Human
Services. Public Welfare, and Mental Health into a single agency.  For the
first time, program staffs that had been separated by bureaucracy have the
chance to work together to address problems confronting families.  FSSA 
maximizes limited resources by working closely with other state agencies
through the Indiana Collaboration Project, local Step Ahead Councils, and
federal agencies.  The goals and priorities of local communities are reshaping
service systems to put the family at the heart of them, with parents empowered 
to really help themselves and to fulfill their obligations to their children.
<p>
Click here for further information on the <a href=#STEP>Step Head </a> concept.
Click here for <a href="/indiana/home.html">
local Step Head </a> contact information.
<p>
FSSA is organized into three divisions:  
<ul>
<li> <a href=#DMH>The Division of Mental Health,</a>
<li> <a href=#DFC>The Division of Family and Children, and </a>
<li> <a href=#DDARS>The Division of Disability, Aging and 
Rehabilitative Services. </a>
</ul>
<p>

<a name=DMH><h3>Division of Mental Health.</h3> </a>
<p>
<b>Indiana Division of Mental Health </b> <br>
402 West Washington Street, Room W353 <br>
Indianapolis, IN 46204-2739
(317) 232-7800 <br>
<p>
Under the aegis of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration,
the Division of Mental Health (DMH) is responsible for assuring that
Indiana citizens have access to appropriate menatl health and addictions
services that promote the greatest extent of self-sufficiency possible.
<p>
To accomplish these purposes, DMH carries five overarching functions:
<ul>
<li> DMH certifies all substance abuse treatment services and licenses all
free-standing psychiatric and alcoholism/drug abuse inpatient treatment
facilities;
<li> DMH certifies all Indiana community mental health centers and other
managed care providers;
<li> DMH contracts with community mental health centers and other agencies
providing a variety of mental health and alcohol and other drug abuse 
treatment or services to assure a continuum of community-based care for
individuals in the following four target populations who are eligible by

<h4>What Is Step Ahead> </h4> 
<p>
Maybe it's easier to say what Step Ahead is NOT.  It's not a new state
program or agency.  Instead, it's a way of mobilizing community resources
and services, putting each county at the center of decision-making.  By
focusing on the county level -- closest to our families -- Indiana is
finding new ways to streamline the system and work together to get help
to families more quickly.
<p>
Step Ahead is a coordinated effort that allows children and families 
the opportunity to reach their full potential.
<p>
<center><i>Working Together to Put Indiana Families a Step Ahead </i> </center>
<p>
Over the years, a vast array of prorgams and services for children and
families have emerged, and families are left to find their way to the 
services they're seeking.  Too many Indiana's children and families were
not always getting the help that was available -- but unknown or not 
easily accessible -- to them.
<p>
Now the time has come for an effective way to channel those resources, so
that each one builds upon the work of others.  That new way is Step Ahead -- 
a bold new approach to human services that has moved Indiana into a
leadership position as our nation seeks better ways to serve families and
children.
<p>
<h4> How Does It Work? </h4>
<p>
Thousands of Indiana residents are working in every county across the state to
improve how we help our neighbors.  They are active on 
<a href="/indiana/home.html">county Step Ahead 
councils </a> that include parents, lcoal and state agencies, schools, 
churches, businesses, and community services.
<p>
Through county Step Ahead councils, they work together to mobilize resources
and identify unmet needs -- applying common sense and real-life experience 
to th ways families can get access to services.
<p>
Since 1991, when Step Ahead councils were formed, counties are starting
to demonstrate success:
<ul>
<li> New efficiencies that will reduce government paperwork.
<li> New funding sources.
<li> New collaboration networks and connections among service providers.
<li> Increased availability and quality of child care and other services.
</ul>

<b>Mission Statement:</b></a><p>
        
        The Indiana Prevention Resource Center (IPRC) was established
in 1987 to assist Indiana-based alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
(ATOD) prevention programs improve the quality of their services.  Our
primary target audience is the community of prevention professionals
and volunteers, and government officials who are providing or
monitoring delivery of ATOD prevention programs to Indiana residents.
We were not established to provide direct prevention services to the
general public, but to provide technical assistance and support to
those who do.  Our primary mission is to support those programs
through the provision of information, materials, consultation, and a
wide range of high-level technical assistance.  Secondarily, as
Indiana's designated RADAR Network (Regional Alcohol and Drug
Awareness Resource Network) State Center, we provide ATOD information,
government publications, and referral services to all Indiana
residents.<p>
        
        The target audience for prevention programs includes
individuals who are not drug dependent. Primary prevention programs
serve non-users and those whose use has not progressed beyond
experimental or infrequent casual use.  Secondary prevention programs
serve those who are in the early stages of drug involvement, while
still reversible through education and intervention programs.  The
objective of ATOD prevention is a lifestyle free of interference
caused by the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.  Such a
lifestyle is predicated upon no use of illegal drugs and no illegal or
harmful use of legal drugs.<p>

<h2><a name=Techn>Grantwriting Technical Assistance</h2></a>
<p>
The IPRC provides a wide range of grantwriting assistance to ATOD prevention programs in 
Indiana, including assistance in locating potential funding sources, development of proposal 
writing skills, proposal writing and critiquing assistance, and sponsorship of week-long 
grantwriting training workshops conducted by the staff of The Grantsmanship Center.  
Technical assistance services are provided without charge to Indiana-based prevention 
programs.  Participants in the week-long  proposal writing workshops pay a minimal charge 
for meals and refreshment breaks, but the cost of materials and the training is absorbed by the 
Indiana Prevention Resource Center.
<p>
Grantwriting Technical Assistance services include:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> research assistance locating potential funding sources
<li> research assistance locating potential partner agencies and consultants
<li> review and critique of proposal drafts
<li> assistance in identifying and locating instructional information on program planning and 
proposal writing
<li> training in granstmanship and strategic fundraising skills
</ul>
<p>
We have extensive print references, and on-line and CD-ROM databases on potential 
governmental, foundation, and corporate funding sources.  We also can provide detailed 
profiles of foundation sources, along with information on funding restrictions, contact people 
and submission procedures.  These reference services are provided without charge to Indiana-
based prevention programs.
<p>
Indiana applicants who are eligible to apply for large federal or foundation grants may request 
our intensive grantwriting assistance.  This service includes up to 200 hours of proposal 
writing, typing and duplicating, and proposal submission services.  Due to staff limitations, 
only a limited number of the most promising PREVENTION proposals are selected to receive 
this intensive level of service.
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2><a name=Intensive>Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service is to increase the amount of 
funding for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug <b>prevention</b> programs available in the 
State of Indiana, by providing grantwriting technical assistance to qualified applicant agencies, 
and assisting them in developing fundable grant applications and contract proposals for federal 
agencies, foundations, or corporations.
<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center will select up to eight grassroots <b>prevention 
</b> organizations per year, that have a project with a high probability of receiving funding, 
to receive this exceptional level of assistance.
<p>
Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Services include up to 200 hours of technical assistance 
services such as:<br>
<ul>
<li> assessment of local readiness to proceed with a full proposal or application
<li> development of concept and funding strategy
<li> consultation on information-gathering tasks
<li> development of local coalitions and partnerships
<li> preparation of draft application or proposal
<li> preparation of budget and final application or proposal documents
<li> compliance monitoring for all technical rules and regulations
<li> typing, duplication, and submission services.
</ul>
<p>
The Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service is limited to applications for competitive or 
"sole source" programs (not "formula grant" or entitlement programs) and must be of 
sufficient size, scope, and duration to warrant 200 hours of technical assistance.
<p>
Applicant agency must be a viable candidate to receive a federal or foundation grant award 
(incorporated entity with a good track record and acceptable fiscal and management control, 
and able to provide or acquire the technical expertise in needs assessment, planning, 
implementation, and evaluation of the project).

Recent media coverage of marijuana issues, much of it orchestrated by 
pro-marijuana activists, has presented a one-sided argument in favor 
of legalization of marijuana smoking.  If left unchallenged, this might 
leave the erroneous impression that the myths and misperceptions 
on which the argument is based represent factual evidence that 
is widely accepted by the general public.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
While I concede the existence of some factual controversy, and that 
informed individuals may disagree over policy, the so-called "facts" 
presented by the pro-marijuana activists are not generally accepted 
by the scientific community.  Just as the Tobacco Institute is not 
accepted as a reliable source of scientific information about cigarette 
smoking, the de facto "Marijuana Institute" should not be accepted as a 
reliable source of scientific information about marijuana smoking.  
The vast majority of experts on health and drug issues dispute much of 
the disinformation used to support the pro-marijuana arguments.
<p>
The pro-marijuana activists base their arguments upon five myths that 
create a smokescreen that attempts to obscure the real concerns that health 
and law enforcement professionals have about marijuana legalization.  
Using side issues, such as hemp as a commercial crop, or the proposed medical 
use of marijuana, they have diverted attention away from their real goal, 
which is the removal of legal sanctions against smoking marijuana to get high.
<p>
<h3>Myth #1 - Decriminalization Won't Increase Use</h3>
The pro-marijuana activists insist that removal of legal sanctions will not 
increase use.  Common sense and history suggest otherwise.  While it is 
obvious that current users ignore the law, a sizable majority of adult 
Americans do not use marijuana.  At least some of those people avoid using 
because it is illegal to do so.  Removal of legal sanctions and the inevitable 
advertising and marketing of the product, once legal, would certainly induce 
at least some additional use.  During the late 1970's, when about half of 
the states passed decriminalization laws, use of marijuana in the U.S. hit 
an all-time high.  By the late 1980's, after the repeal of these state 
decriminalization laws, use dropped to less than a third of its previous 
levels.

<h3>Myth #2 - Marijuana Smoking is "Risk-Free"</h3>
Smoking anything is a health hazard.  Consuming any intoxicating substance 
creates risks associated with impaired judgment and increased risk of 
accidents.  To suggest that people can smoke an intoxicating substance and 
not expose themselves to risks is to ignore reality.  
<p>
Recently, yet another study was published showing evidence of a strong 
statistical link between marijuana smoking and lung cancer.  This latest 
report was published in the prestigious <i>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs.</i>   
This journal is published by the Haight Ashbury clinic in San Francisco, 
and is considered to be quite liberal.  It's editorial and advisory 
boards include such people as Andrew Weil, Peter Bourne, 
Eugene Schoenfeld (Dr. HIP-pocrates), and Michael Aldrich.  
These experts are often cited by the pro-marijuana activists in 
support of their arguments.  The latest research is consistent with 
evidence of abnormal cell development discovered in the lungs of marijuana 
smokers over a decade ago by Donald Tashkin and his colleagues.  Inhaling 
any type of smoke damages the lungs.
<h5>Sridhar KS et al., <i>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs</i>26:285-289, 1994.</h5>
Marijuana smoking also has been associated with chronic bronchitis, 
lowered hormonal levels, decreases in activity in the immune system, 
and other significant health risks.  While the statistical evidence from 
these studies may not "prove" causation, they certainly establish a 
rational basis upon which public policymakers can make decisions.
<p>
Intoxication from any source impairs judgment and increases accident risks.  
The two most widely quoted studies on accident risk and marijuana use, 
the <i>Baltimore Trauma Study</i> and the <i>California Young Male 
Driver Study</i> 
both showed strong evidence that marijuana use significantly increases 
accident risks.  
<h5>Soderstorm, et al.,<i> Archives of Surgery</i> 123:733-737, 1988.<br>
William, et al., <i>Public Health Reports</i> 100:19-25, 1985. 
</h5>
<h3>Myth #3 - "Not One Single Death" Has Been Caused by Marijuana</h3>
While THC, the active ingredient in marijuana is unlikely to cause acute 
overdoses by lethal toxicity, marijuana's link with accident deaths and 
lung cancer are ignored by the activists when they argue that marijuana 
use doesn't kill anyone.  Also left out of the equation are deaths 
associated with criminal activities.  Even if one eliminates those crimes 
associated with drug dealing, Bureau of Justice Statistics
evidence shows that about half of all criminals commit their crimes while 
intoxicated -- at least some intoxicated by marijuana.  
<h5> Bureau of Justice Statistics, <i>Profile of State Prison Inmates -
1986.</i>  U.S. Department of Justice, January, 1988 </h5>
Does marijuana kill as many people as tobacco or alcohol?  Obviously not.  
Does marijuana cause <b>any</b> deaths?  Obviously yes.  How many deaths are 
caused by marijuana?  A flip answer might be, "Fewer than by R. J. Reynolds, 
and more than O.J. Simpson was accused of."
<p>
<h3>Myth #4 - Marijuana as Miracle Drug</h3>
The pro-marijuana activists have recently focused their attention on 
so-called "medical benefits" of marijuana for controlling nausea in certain 
chemotherapy patients, or in the treatment of glaucoma, as a smokescreen 
for legalizing marijuana.  They argue that THC, the active ingredient in 
marijuana, has some unique medical benefit that cannot be obtained from 
other drugs.  They suggest that the only solution is to make marijuana 
cigarettes available as prescription drugs.  
<p>
Before getting into the dispute over the merits of medical use of THC, 
one has to question the logic in using cigarettes of any type as a vehicle 
for administering medication.  More than half of the active dose of the 
drug is destroyed by the combustion, and the remaining drug is commingled 
with toxic tars and particulate matter in the smoke.  We don't smoke 
aspirin when we have a headache and don't smoke penicillin for an infection.  
Inhaling any type of smoke is injurious to one's health.  Smoking is an 
inefficient and potentially deadly means of drug administration. 
<p>
A national scientific consensus panel of the National Institutes
of Health studied 
the issue of potential medical use of marijuana.  It concluded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Scientists at the National Institutes if Health indicate that, after
carefully examining the existing preclinical and human data, there
is no evidence to suggest that smoked marijuana might be superior
to currently available therapies for glaucoma, weight loss associated
with AIDS, nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy,
muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, or intractable
pain. 
<h5>Voth EA, Marihuana and its reviews. <i>JAMA: Journal of the
American Medical Association</i> 332:274, 1995. </h5>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Despite the scientific consensus that there is no unique medical benefit
from marijuana use, physicians who sincerely believe that their 
chemotherapy or glaucoma patients would benefit from the so-called 
medicinal effects of marijuana are already able to legally prescribe 
THC in a tablet, called <i>Marinol</i> (dronabinol), that can be swallowed.  
This option allows for a more efficient system for absorption of the THC, 
and avoids the health hazards associated with breathing any type of smoke.  
<p>
The pro-marijuana activists don't like this option, since users of the 
tablet don't get very high.  Also, their arguments for legalizing pot 
smoking are diminished if they admit that the tablets are legally available, 
so they pretend that <i>Marinol</i> doesn't exist, and lobby naive 
politicians to support "compassionate medical use" of marijuana cigarettes.
<p>
The suggestion that marijuana smoking is beneficial in the treatment of 
asthma defies logic.  Inhalation of any type of smoke creates serious 
problems for asthma patients.
<p>
<h3>Myth #5 - Hemp: New Wave Crop to Save the Planet</h3>
The latest tactic used by the pro-marijuana activists is to promote 
the commercial cultivation of "hemp" as a source of products such as fiber for 
cloth and paper, or as a source of protein or seed oil.  Often they cite 
some supposed ecological benefit as a means of getting the support of 
environmental activists.
<p>
It is true that, with significant effort and chemical treatment, usable 
cloth can be produced from the fibers of the hemp plant.  The fibers are 
naturally quite scratchy and need to be treated chemically or physically 
to soften them.  During the Middle Ages, penitents wore scratchy hemp 
garments, "sackcloth and ashes," an penance for their sins -- it was a 
mild form of torture.  To suggest that coarse, brown fibers from the hemp 
plant are somehow superior to soft white cotton or linen is ludicrous.   
The cost of making this fiber commercially viable, as clothing that is
acceptible to anyone but the fringe elements of society, is too high to 
be practical.
<p>
Likewise, with effort, the fiber can be made into paper.  But even clear 
cutting of forests every fifty years to make paper from wood is less 
damaging to the environment than planting, cultivation, fertilization, 
weed control, and harvesting of fields full of annual crops. Marijuana 
plants produce much less seed per acre than corn, so its use as a 
source of food or seed oil is of dubious value.  It is questionable
whether the amount of oil produced by an acre of hemp would generate
as much fuel oil as would be needed to operate the farm implements
needed to plant, cultivate, and harvest the crop.
<p>
<p>
The pro-marijuana activists want us to forget that three generations 
of policymakers have looked at the evidence and determined that legalization 
of marijuana is a bad idea.  A smokescreen of myths and misperceptions won't 
change that.

<P>
The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires
alcohol and drug testing of safety-sensitive employees in the
aviation, motor carrier, railroad, and mass transit industries.
The DOT published rules mandating anti-drug and alcohol misuse
prevention programs in February 1994. The rules also expand and
supplement existing drug testing rules published in November 1988
that mandated drug testing of aviation, interstate motor carrier,
railroad, pipeline, and commercial marine employees. The February
1994 rules generally require implementation beginning on January
1, 1995 for large employers (generally, 50 or more safety-sensitive
drivers) and January 1, 1996 for all other employers.
<P>
The current rules for drug testing of interstate commercial motor
vehicle drivers remain in effect until the new rules are required
to be implemented.
<H2><A NAME="Rules">What are the rules?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The FHWA has issued a rule requiring alcohol and drug testing
of drivers who are required to have a commercial driver's license.
The DOT rules include procedures for urine drug testing and breath
alcohol testing. The urine drug testing procedures rule was issued
in December 1989 and governs drug testing programs mandated by
the FHWA. The 1994 amendments to Part 40 add breath alcohol testing
procedures and additional urine specimen collection procedures
that provide for split urine specimens.
<H2><A NAME="Affected">Who is affected by these rules?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The FHWA rules cover safety-sensitive employees in transportation
who drive commercial motor vehicles requiring a CDL to operate.
There are about 6,600,000 holders of CDLs.
<P>
Examples of drivers and employers that are subject to these rules
are:
<UL>
<LI>Federal, State, and local governments
<LI>Apiarian industry (Beekeepers)
<LI>For-Hire Motor Carriers
<LI>Civic Organizations
<LI>Churches
<LI>Indian Tribe
<LI>Farmers and Custom Harvesters
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Alcohol">What alcohol use is prohibited?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Because alcohol is a legal substance, the rules define specific
prohibited alcohol-related conduct. Performance of safety-sensitive
functions is prohibited:
<UL>
<LI>While having a breath alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent
of greater as indicated by an alcohol breath test.
<LI>While using alcohol.
<LI>Within four hours after using alcohol.
</UL>

<P>
In addition, refusing to submit to an alcohol test and using alcohol
within eight hours after an accident or until tested (for drivers
required to be tested) are prohibited.
<H2><A NAME="Alctest">What alcohol tests are required?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The following alcohol tests are required:
<UL>
<LI><B>Preemployment - </B>conducted before applicants are hired
or after an offer to hire, but before actually performing safety-sensitive
functions for the first time. Also required when employees transfer
to a safety-sensitive (Driver) position.
<LI><B>Post-accident - </B>conducted after accidents on drivers
whose performance could have contributed to the accident (as determined
by a citation for a moving traffic violation) and for all fatal
accidents even if the driver is not cited for a moving traffic
violation.
<LI><B>Reasonable suspicion - </B>conducted when a trained supervisor
or company official observes behavior or appearance that is characteristic
of alcohol misuse.
<LI><B>Random -</B> conducted on a random unannounced basis just
before, during or just after performance of safety-sensitive functions.
<LI><B>Return-to-duty and follow-up -</B> conducted when an individual
who has violated the prohibited alcohol conduct standards returns
to performing safety-sensitive duties. Follow-up tests are unannounced
and at least 6 tests must be conducted in the first 12 months
after a driver returns to duty. Follow-up testing may be extended
for up to 60 months following return to duty.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Randtest">How will random alcohol testing work?
</H2></A><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Random alcohol testing must be conducted just before, during,
or just after a driver's performance of safety-sensitive duties.
The driver is randomly selected for testing (usually from a &quot;pool&quot;
of drivers subject to testing). The testing dates and times are
unannounced and are with unpredictable frequency throughout the
year. Each year, the number of random tests conducted by the employer
must equal at least 25% of all the safety-sensitive drivers. These
rules provide for adjustments to the annual random testing rate
based on the violations (alcohol tests 0.04 or greater and refusals
to test) in the industry subject to the FHWA regulations. The
random rate is set for each industry regulated by the DOT; thus,
aviation employees could be tested at a rate different from commercial
motor vehicle drivers.
<H2><A NAME="Howtest">How will alcohol testing be done?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The rules require breath testing using evidential breath testing
(EBT) devices approved by the NHTSA. The NHTSA periodically publishes
a list of approved devices in the <I>Federal Register</I>. Two
breath tests are required to determine if a person has a prohibited
alcohol concentration. A screening test is conducted first. Any
result less than 0.02 alcohol concentration is considered a &quot;negative&quot;
test. If the alcohol concentration is 0.02 or greater, a second
confirmation test must be conducted. The driver and the individual
conducting the breath test (called a breath alcohol technician
(BAT)) complete the alcohol testing form to ensure that the results
are properly recorded. The confirmation test, if required, must
be conducted using an EBT that prints out the results, date and
time, a sequential test number, and the name and serial number
of the EBT to ensure the reliability of the results. The confirmation
test results determine any actions taken. Testing procedures that
ensure accuracy, reliability and confidentiality of test results
are outlined in the Part 40 rule. These procedures include training
and proficiency requirements for the breath alcohol technicians
(BAT), quality assurance plans for the breath testing devices
(including calibration requirements for a suitable test location),
and protection of driver test records.
<H2><A NAME="Whotest">Who does the testing?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Employers are responsible for implementing and conducting the
testing programs. They may do this using their own employees,
contract services, or by joining together in a consortium that
provides services to all member companies. Law enforcement officers
will not conduct the tests as part of roadside or other inspections.
However, under certain circumstances, post-accident tests conducted
by law enforcement personnel will be acceptable. Any individual
who conducts the testing must be trained to operate the EBT and
be proficient in the breath testing procedures.
<H2><A NAME="Whatconseq">What are the consequences of alcohol
misuse?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Drivers who engage in prohibited alcohol conduct must be immediately
removed from safety-sensitive functions. Drivers who have engaged
in alcohol misuse cannot return to safety-sensitive duties until
they have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional and
complied with any treatment recommendations to assist them with
an alcohol problem. To further safeguard transportation safety,
drivers who have any alcohol concentration (defined as 0.02 or
greater) when tested just before, during or just after performing
safety-sensitive functions must also be removed form performing
such duties for 24 hours. If a driver's behavior or appearance
suggest alcohol misuse, a reasonable suspicion alcohol test must
be conducted. If a breath test cannot be administered, the driver
must be removed from performing safety-sensitive duties for at
least 24 hours. A violation of these employer-based testing rules
is not placed on, nor affects, the driver's CDL record.
<H2><A NAME="EmplRules">How will employees know about these new
rules?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Employers must provide detailed information about alcohol misuse,
the employer's policy, the testing requirements, and how and where
drivers can get help for alcohol abuse. Supervisors of safety-sensitive
drivers must attend at least one hour of training on alcohol misuse
symptoms and indicators used in making determinations for reasonable
suspicion testing.
<H2><A NAME="EmplRehab">Are employees entitled to rehabilitation?</A>
</H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Drivers who violate the alcohol misuse rules will be referred
to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. Any treatment
or rehabilitation would be provided in accordance with the employers'
policy or labor/management agreements. The employer is not required
under these rules to provide rehabilitation, pay for treatment,
or reinstate the driver in his/her safety-sensitive position.
Any employer who does decide to return a driver to safety-sensitive
duties must ensure that the driver: 1) has been evaluated by a
substance abuse professional; 2) has complied with any recommended
treatment; 3) has taken a return-to-duty alcohol test (with a
result less than 0.02); and 4) is subject to unannounced follow-up
alcohol tests.
<H2><A NAME="FHWAfollow">How will the FHWA know if these rules
are being followed? </A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Employers are required to keep detailed records of their alcohol
misuse prevention programs. The FHWA will conduct inspections
or audits of employers' programs. Additionally, selected employers
will have to submit annual calendar year summary reports to the
FHWA. These reports will be used to help monitor compliance with
and enforcement of the rules, as well as to provide data on the
extent of alcohol misuse and the need for any future program and
regulatory changes.
<H2><A NAME="Alcconfid">Are driver alcohol testing records confidential?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>


<P>
Yes? Driver alcohol testing records are confidential. Test results
and other confidential information may only be released to the
employer and the substance abuse professional. Any other release
of this information is only with the driver's consent. If a driver
initiates a grievance, hearing, lawsuit or other action as a result
of a violation of these rules, the employer may release relevant
information to the decision maker.
<H2><A NAME="Foreign">Will foreign operators have to comply with
these rules? </A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The FHWA has issued a proposed rule that would subject foreign
motor carriers to the alcohol misuse rules when their drivers
are operating in the United States beginning in 1996. the proposal,
however, indicates that FHWA will pursue international agreements
in this area because they would more effectively satisfy the basic
objectives and purposes of this rule. If such agreements are in
place prior to 1996, this rule would not apply to foreign operators.
<H2><A NAME="OtherAlc">Will the DOT authorize any alcohol testing
methods besides breath testing?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The alcohol testing rules authorize and require only breath alcohol
testing methods. However, the DOT has issued two other notices
that propose to expand alcohol testing options. A proposal to
use blood alcohol testing for reasonable suspicion and post-accident
tests where breath testing is not readily available was published
in February 1994. The proposal would enable employers to obtain
a blood alcohol test when an EBT and/or trained breath alcohol
technician is not available for tests that may be necessary in
remote locations or at unpredictable hours. The proposal contains
qualifications for personnel authorized to draw a blood sample,
procedures for testing blood samples, qualifications for laboratories
performing the blood alcohol analysis, and protections and safeguards
for drivers. The DOT has also proposed model specifications for
alcohol screening test devices. These proposed specifications
detail precision and accuracy requirements for disposable or portable
devices that could be used for screening tests to determine an
alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater. Potentially, these specifications
could be applied to saliva, breath or other body fluids. If a
&quot;positive&quot; result (0.02 or greater) is obtained on the
screening test devices, a confirmation test would be required
using an EBT. The DOT hopes to issue final specifications, begin
approving any qualified alcohol screening devices, and provide
procedures for their use before the implementation dates of the
alcohol testing rules.
<H2><A NAME="Drugtest">What about drug testing?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The drug testing rules issued by FHWA in November 1988, with later
amendments, remain in effect. The FHWA's new controlled substances
and alcohol testing rules will take effect beginning in January
1995 for all drivers of vehicles requiring a commercial driver's
license employed or used by large employers. However, drug testing
split samples are required to be collected starting on August
15, 1994. The drug testing rules cover the same drivers as the
alcohol testing rules. The types of tests required are: pre-employment;
reasonable suspicion; post-accident; random; return-to-duty; and
follow-up.
<H2><A NAME="Howdrug">How is drug testing done?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The DOT drug and alcohol testing procedures rule (49 CRF Part
40) sets forth the procedures for drug testing in the FHWA industries.
Drug testing is conducted by analyzing a driver's urine specimen.
The analysis is performed at laboratories certified and monitored
by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). There are
over 90 DHHS-certified drug testing laboratories located throughout
the United States. The list of DHHS approved laboratories is published
monthly in the <I>Federal Register</I>. The driver provides a
urine specimen in a location that affords privacy and the &quot;collector&quot;
seals and labels the specimen, completes a chain of custody document,
and prepares the specimen and accompanying paperwork for shipment
to a drug testing laboratory. The specimen collection procedures
and chain of custody ensure that the specimen's security, proper
identification and integrity are not compromised. The Omnibus
Act requires that drug testing procedures for commercial motor
vehicle drivers include split specimen procedures. Each urine
specimen is subdivided into two bottles labeled as a &quot;primary&quot;
and a &quot;split&quot; specimen. Both bottles are sent to a laboratory.
Only the primary specimen is opened and used for the urinalysis.
The split specimen bottle remains sealed and is stored at the
laboratory. If the analysis of the primary specimen confirms the
presence of illegal, controlled substances, the driver has 72
hours to request the split specimen be sent to another DHHS certified
laboratory for analysis. This split specimen procedure essentially
provides the driver with an opportunity for a &quot;second opinion.&quot;
<H2><A NAME="Whatdrug">What drugs are tested for?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
All urine specimens are analyzed for the following drugs:
<OL>
<LI>Marijuana (THC metabolite)
<LI>Cocaine
<LI>Amphetamines
<LI>Opiates (including heroin)
<LI>Phencyclidine (PCP)
</OL>

<P>
The testing is a two-stage process. First, a screening test is
performed. If it is positive for one or more of the drugs, then
a confirmation test is performed for each identified drug using
state-of-the-art gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis. GC/MS confirmation ensures that over-the-counter medications
or preparations are not reported as positive results.
<H2><A NAME="Whodrug">Who reviews and interprets the laboratory
results?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
All drug test results are reviewed and interpreted by a physician
(Medical Review Officer (MRO)) before they are reported to the
employer. If the laboratory reports a positive result to the MRO,
the MRO contacts the driver (in person or by telephone) and conducts
an interview to determine if there is an alternative medical explanation
for the drugs found in the driver's urine specimen. For all the
drugs except PCP, there are some limited, legitimate medical uses
that may explain the positive test result. If the driver provides
appropriate documentation and the MRO determines that it is legitimate
medical use of the prohibited drug, the drug test result is reported
as negative to the employer.
<H2><A NAME="Drugprohib">What drug use is prohibited?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
The drug rules prohibit any unauthorized use of the controlled
substances. Illicit use of drugs by safety-sensitive drivers is
prohibited on or off duty. The FHWA has some additional rules
that prohibit the use of legally prescribed controlled substances
(such as barbiturates, amphetamines, morphine, etc.) by safety-sensitive
drivers involved in interstate commerce. Other regulations require
drivers involved in interstate commerce to report any medical
use of controlled substances.
<H2><A NAME="Drugconseq">What are the consequences of a positive
drug test?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
As with an alcohol misuse violation, a driver must be removed
from safety-sensitive duty if he/she has a positive drug test
result. The removal cannot take place until the MRO has interviewed
the driver and determined that the positive drug test resulted
from the unauthorized use of a controlled substance. A driver
cannot be returned to safety-sensitive duties until he/she has
been evaluated by a substance abuse professional or MRO, has complied
with recommended rehabilitation, and has a negative result on
a return-to-duty drug test. Follow-up testing to monitor the driver's
continued abstinence from drug use may be required.
<H2><A NAME="Randdrug">How does random drug testing work?
</H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Employers are responsible for conducting random, unannounced drug
tests. The total number conducted each year must equal at least
50% of the safety-sensitive drivers. Some drivers may be tested
more than once each year; some may not be tested at all depending
on the random selection. Random testing for drugs does not have
to be conducted in immediate time proximity to performing safety-sensitive
functions. Once notified of selection for testing, however, a
driver must proceed to a collection site to accomplish the urine
specimen collection. The FHWA has issued a proposal to permit
adjustment to the random drug testing rate. The proposal is similar
to what is required for random alcohol testing. The random drug
testing rate would be determined annually based upon the random
positive rate for the FHWA industry.
<H2><A NAME="Empled">Are employee education and training required?</A>
</H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Employers must provide information on drug use and treatment resources
to safety-sensitive drivers. All supervisors and officials of
businesses with safety-sensitive drivers must attend at least
one hour of training on the signs and symptoms of drug abuse.
This training is necessary to assist supervisors and company officials
in making appropriate determinations for reasonable suspicion
testing.
<H2><A NAME="Drugconfid">Are driver drug testing records confidential?</A>
</H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Yes! Driver drug testing results and records are maintained under
strict confidentiality by the employer, the drug testing laboratory,
and the medical review officer. They cannot be released to others
without the written consent of the driver. Exceptions to these
confidentiality provisions are limited to a decision maker in
arbitration, litigation or administrative proceedings arising
from a positive drug test. Statistical records and reports are
maintained by employers and drug testing laboratories. This information
is aggregated data and is used to monitor compliance with the
rules and to assess the effectiveness of the drug testing programs.
<H2><A NAME="MoreInfo">Where can I get more information?</A></H2><A HREF="#MENU"> Return to Menu</A>

<P>
Specific questions addressing any of the above material may be
directed to your local FHWA Regional Office. <P><HR>

October 1994
<P>
Governor Evan Bayh and Members of the Indiana General Assembly,
<P>
In September 1990, The Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana
issued its first strategic report detailing sixty recommended
actions to address alcohol and other drug problems described as
&quot;of immense proportions, threatening the health and well-being
of every citizen in our state&quot;. In the intervening four years,
in spite of an economic slow-down that impeded the development
of resources needed to implement some of the report's recommended
actions and changing federal priorities that diminished the attention
to alcohol and other drug abuse issues, remarkable progress has
been made. Of the sixty recommended actions in the 1990 report,
forty-two have been implemented as of this writing.
<P>
We are most proud of the progress that has been made in bringing
about planning and action partnerships at the state and local
levels and, most importantly, between local communities and state
government. What we have accomplished is due in large part to
the willingness of citizens all across Indiana to rise to the
challenge and a growing responsiveness of state government to
support community decision-making.
<P>
While there is clear evidence of success in the reduction of alcohol
and other drug-related problems in Indiana since 1990, much remains
to be done. Deaths and injuries related to alcohol and other drug-impaired
driving are down, but still unacceptably high. Use of alcohol
by school-age children is down, as is the consumption rate for
adults. But in the last two years, we have observed an increase
in the use of tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, and other illegal
drugs by youth, a disturbing departure from earlier trends.
<P>
As evidenced by the street cost of illegal drugs, Indiana's interdiction
efforts appear to have been successful with respect to intercepting
the supply of cocaine, including crack cocaine. On the other hand
the price of marijuana has dropped, a reflection of an expanding
supply which contributed to increased use of this drug by school-age
youth in 1993-94.
<P>
This report is the result of a planning process that featured
citizen participation. Beginning with Drug Summit II, proceeding
through four regional input forums, and concluding with the Governor's
Conference on Violence and Drugs, we heard from Hoosiers from
all across our state. They offered their views on the most pressing
problems needing attention as well as recommendations for action.
This sharing of information and ideas is evidence that there remains
a strong citizen commitment for making Indiana a safer and healthier
place in which to live through the further reduction of the problems
associated with the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
<P>

<p>
*[Editor's note:  Statistics presented are "prevalence" rates, not "incidence"
rates.]
<p>
Progress on this indicator seems to have reversed in 1993, and the statewide
rate of "binge drinking" (drinking five or more drinks on a single occasion
within the past two weeks) continues to be much higher than the national
average.  This data is available locally from school districts which 
participated in the "Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use by Indiana Children
and Adolescents" 1994 Survey.

The Indiana Criminal Justics Institute began a system for multi-jurisdictional
task forces to report street costs of illicit drugs, using data from 
undercover buys.  This data does not account for purity or volume of purchase.  
A report listing task force purchases and dollar values is available.

Indiana Division of Mental Health Adopts New Prevention Model<p>


<pre>
The Indiana Division of Mental Health (DMH) has announced the 
adoption of a new model for the delivery of direct prevention 
services, to be implemented July 1, 1997.  The new model 
will better focus the Division's efforts to reduce the 
prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse by 
establishing an absolute priority for funding programs 
that will serve those most likely to begin use during the 
next 24 months.
<p>
According to data developed from six years of surveys by 
the Indiana Prevention Resource Center, nearly three-fourths 
of all new experimentation with drugs, and more than two-thirds 
of all new regular use begins during the middle school years.  
Data from other sources verifies that the majority of new 
use in this age group occurs during the after-school hours 
from 3 pm to 6 pm, when the young adolescents are left 
without adult supervision.
<p>
The new DMH prevention delivery model will establish 14 
regional prevention coalitions that will develop between 
250 and 300 local direct prevention services programs aimed
at 10- through 14-year olds.  All programs funded by DMH 
will be aimed at primary prevention target audiences (those 
who are not yet regular users), and will provide positive 
youth development experiences in after school hours that 
will focus on the development or enhancement of "protective 
factors" to reduce the likelihood of future drug use.
<p>
DMH has issued a Broad Agency Announcement soliciting 
applicants for to manage the 14 regional prevention coalitions.  
Proposals are due February 17, 1997.
<p>

Indiana's "Zero Tolerance" Law Now in Effect<p>


<pre>

Drivers under Indiana's legal drinking age of 21 risk a fine and
a one year license suspension if they drive an automobile with any
measurable amount of alcohol on their breaths. <p>

Effective January 1, 1997, Indiana's new "Zero Tolerance" law makes it
a Class A Infraction for a person under the age of 21 to operate a
vehicle in Indiana with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.02%
or more alcohol by volume. Those operating with a BAC of 0.10% or
more are subject to prosecution as a Class C misdemeanor.  Anyone
operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol and/or another drug or
medicine may be prosecuted for a Class A misdemeanor. <p>

The new law, passed in 1996 by the Indiana General Assembly,
recognizes that alcohol and other drugs can impair inexperienced
drivers at levels far lower than the 0.10% presumptive level of
intoxication used in Indiana law to enforce the impaired driving
statutes.  The rationale for imposing a 0.02% level is to allow for
trace amounts of alcohol that may be present in foods or some legal
over-the-counter medications, while still making it clear that Indiana
will not tolerate underage drinking.  It was believed that suspension
of a drivers license may be seen as a greater penalty by most youth
than fines or even short executed jail sentences. <p>

The full text of Indiana's "Zero Tolerance" law may be found at <b> IC 9-30-5-8.5 </b> <p>

Carmel-Clay Schools to Drug Test Smokers<p>


<pre>
Beginning with the start of the second semester, January 29, students in the
Carmel-Clay School Corporation who violate school rules on smoking on school
property will be subject to drug testing.  The Carmel-Clay drug test policy
will require students violating any school rule that is serious enough to subject 
them to a three-day or longer suspension to participate in the school corporation's
drug testing plan, as a condition of continued enrollment.
<p>
Information meetings for students at the high school and two middle schools are
planned for the next two weeks, prior to implementation of the policy.  The
Carmel-Clay drug testing plan is a "for cause" testing program, and not a
"random" testing program.  It is targeted at students who violate rules and
are most likely to use drugs.
<p>
During the school board discussion prior to last fall's vote approving the plan,
the district's above-the-state average rates of self-reported drug use, and the 
powerful statistical link ("gateway drug effect") between cigarette smoking and 
use of other illicit drugs were cited as the rationale for implementing the drug
test plan and for including students who are caught smoking on school property 
in the drug testing plan.

Increase in Violent Crime in Indiana Blamed on Crack Cocaine Epidemic<p>


<pre>
In his annual "State of the Streets" address, Marion County Prosecutor
Scott Newman blamed the increase in violent crime in such major Indiana 
cities as Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Gary, along with other Midwestern 
cities such as Kansas City and Louisville, on the rapid rise in crack
cocaine use in the Midwest.
<p>
"Like a wave that works back and forth across the country to different 
tiers of cities, crack cocaine has brought a wave of violence with it 
wherever it goes," Newman told the members of the Kiwanis Club of 
Indianapolis, hosts of the annual event.  While some large cities in the
U.S. saw a decline in murders last year, Indianapolis experienced its
highest total ever.  In the inner city areas patrolled by the Indianapolis 
Police Department, there were 120 homicides in 1996 among the 374,000 
residents.  In the outer areas of the city patrolled by the Marion County
Sheriff's Department, there were 19 homicides among the 443,000 residents.
Newman said this was a case of a "Tale of Two Cities" in one, with the 
crack-ridden inner city areas burdened with violence related to crack cocaine
dealing.
<p>
According to Newman, dealers feel a need to demonstrate their violent tactics 
as a means of "protecting" their turf from competitors, to collect drug-related 
debts, and to take over new territory.  He suggested that only by involving 
neighborhoods in formulating solutions, can the problem be effectively 
addressed.  He cited the inner city neighborhoods of Stringtown and Haughville 
as areas where homicides and violent crime dropped after neighborhood groups 
teamed with law enforcement to protect the neighborhoods from crack dealing.

State officials charged with the responsibility of dealing with youth access
to tobacco products urged the Indiana General Assembly to sustain former Governor 
Evan Bayh's veto of a bill passed in the closing days of last Spring's session
that preempts local ordinances controlling conditions of tobacco sales.  The
veto override vote is expected in the next week or so.
<p>
State health organizations, associations of local governments, and the attorney
general, health commissioner, and superintendent of public instruction all are 
opposed to the veto override.  The tobacco industry, and cigarette retailers are
supporting the override.  If the bill becomes law over the governor's veto, it 
would invalidate local and county ordinances controlling such practices as 
licensing of tobacco retailers, bans on sales and advertising near schools, and 
local penalties for sales to minors or possession to tobacco by minors.
<p>
While the bill would toughen state-level regulation of tobacco possession by 
minors, the pro-health Tobacco-Free Youth Coalition opposes it, since it will 
eliminate some powerful controls on youth access to tobacco.  The Tobacco 
industry has supported local preemption statutes in many states over the past 
fifteen years, as their primary strategy for weakening the clout of pro-health
activists.  Local premption is the tobacco industry's top legislative priority 
at the state level across the nation, and this veto override vote is seen as
a test of the industry's clout.

<!-- Story Start -->
An Anderson, Indiana bartender was charged with reckless homicide in the October 
death of a bar patron who was served excessive amounts of alcohol, according to 
Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings.  Bartender Gay Ann Beeman was charged 
with reckless homicide, and sale to a prohibited person (an intoxicated person),
and her bond was set at $10,000.
<p>
Beeman was a bartender at Snow's Saloon in Frankton, and allegedly served a fatal 
number of drinks to Terry Hudson on October 29, 1996.  Hudson's blood alcohol 
concentration was 0.567%.  Beeman is charged with serving excessive amounts of alcohol
and then failing to provide aid when he passed out.  She refused to provide any 
assistance and asked two of Hudson's friends to remove hom from the premises.  
The two friends left Hudson sitting near Frankton High School where his body 
was found several hours later.  The two friends face felony charges of assisting 
a criminal.

Indiana Underage Drinking Coalition Receives Grant from Robt. Wood Johnson Foundation<p>
<!-- Headline End -->

<pre>
<!-- Story Start -->
The Indiana Underage Drinking Coalition was awarded a four-year $840,143 grant
from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to fund the startup of a new statewide
initiative to discourage underage drinking in Indiana.  The award to the 
<b>Indiana Communities for Drug-Free Youth, Inc. </b> will provide funding for 
public information campaigns, youth development activities, and the implementation
of a prevention plan.  The programs will focus on influencing the attitudes of 
youth, parents, and the general public to support policy changes that will 
discourage underage drinking.  The funds, however, will not be used for 
lobbying activities.
<p>
RWJF is funding eleven statewide coalitions, from Puerto Rico to Oregon, through 
its initiative "Reducing Underage Drinking through Community and State Coalitions."
The national initiative is being managed for RWJF by the American Medical 
Association.  The funded groups will combine -- and build upon -- hundreds of 
smaller organizations to change the environment in which young people learn 
about drinking.  
<p>
The new campaigns -- around policies, alcohol advertising and public attitudes -- 
will focus on various segments of the public and, to a degree not tried before, will 
involve young people and broader sections of American communities.  RWJF is 
investing $10.2 million in the four-year program nationwide.
<p>
In Indiana, youth will be intimately involved in every aspect of the new Coalition.  
There will be one youth partner for every adult representative on all Coalition committees
and councils, which will also have youth and adult co-chairs.  Together, the youth and 
adults will determine the Coalition's annual agenda and implementation.
<p> 
Indiana's proposal was prepared by Jean Pock, of Indiana Communities for Drug-Free 
Youth, Inc., and members of the Coalition.  Rosemary King, Grants Assistance Specialist 
with the Indiana Prevention Resource Center provided technical assistance in developing 
the funded proposal.

Bill to Increase Division of Mental Health's Share of Riverboat Tax Passes first step in House<p>
<!-- Headline End -->

<pre>
<!-- Story Start -->
House Bill 1135, which would increase the riverboat admissions tax from $3 to $4 
including increasing the Indiana Division of Mental Health's (DMH) allocation from 10 cents 
per admission to 35 cents per admission, has passed its first test.  The Committee on 
Ways and Means held its hearing on the bill on January 14, and made a "do pass" 
recommendation to the full House.  The bill has a very good chance of passing the
House in the next few weeks.
<p>
If both houses pass the bill as presently written, and it is signed into law by the
governor, DMH's revenue from the giverboat gambling tax would more than triple, and 
it would provide the first new revenue stream for addictions prevention and treatment in several years.
The funds generated under this bill would support prevention and treatment programs
for alcohol, other drugs, and gambling addiction.  At least 25% of the funds would be 
earmarked for gambling addiction prevention and treatment.  The remaining 75% can be 
used by DMH for alcohol, other drug, and/or gambling prevention and treatment programs. 
In the past, DMH has allocated approximately 20% of their addictions funds for ATOD
(alcohol, tobacco, and other drug) prevention programs, so some significant additional 
funding for prevention programs could be expected if the bill is signed into law.
<p>
When all ten riverboats are operating (expected within the next year), it is estimated 
that the tax will generate several million dollars per year (likely $4 to $6 million) for
DMH.

Bill Providing Increased Addiction Funding Passes House<p>
<!-- Headline End -->

<pre>
<!-- Story Start -->
The Indiana House of Representatives passed HB1135, which would increase the 
riverboat casino admissions tax by $1 per ticket, and earmark 25 cents of 
that increase for the prevention and treatment of addiction to alcohol, drugs,
or gambling.  The bill passed the House on third reading by a vote of 55 to 43 
on January 30, 1997, and was referred to the Senate where it awaits action.
<p>
The bill would raise the Indiana Division of Mental Health's (DMH) share of
the riverboat admissions tax from ten cents to thirty-five cents per admission. 
Twenty five percent of that sum would be earmarked for gambling prevention and 
treatment, and the remaining 75% could be used for alcohol, drug, and/or 
gambling addiction prevention and treatment programs.  In the past, DMH has 
used approximately 20% of available revenues of this sort to fund prevention 
programs.  The bill is expected to add $7 to $8 million in new revenue each 
year for DMH programs.

Indiana Senate Passes Bill Making Possession of Tobacco by Minors Illegal<p>
<!-- Headline End -->

<pre>
<!-- Story Start -->
The Indiana Senate has passed Senate Bill 0006, which makes possession of
tobacco products by persons under the age of 18 a Class C Infraction.  A 
Class C Infraction is punishable by a fine of up to $500 plus court costs.
<p>
Current Indiana laws makes purchase of tobacco, or "accepting tobacco for 
personal use" an infraction, but the new bill makes simple "possession" of 
tobacco by minors illegal.  This provision will make enforcement easier,  
since intent is not an issue.
<p>
The Senate vote on final passage was 46-4.  It has been referred to the 
House of Representatives, where action is expected soon.

<TITLE>IPRC - Version of Prevention Primer: RADAR Network</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>
Re-posted by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center at Indiana University<br>
<h3><i>Prevention Primer:</i></h3>
<H1>RADAR Network</H1><P>

The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) established the
Regional Alcohol and Drug Awareness Resource (RADAR) Network to
make current prevention information readily available to those who
need it most--prevention practitioners at the State and community
levels.<P>

The RADAR Network responds to the need for prevention services
closer to home, staffed by people who understand the unique assets
and liabilities of local communities. The RADAR Network was formed
in partnership with State governments and national constituency
groups. The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
(NCADI) serves as the national center for information and services,
but the satellite centers of the RADAR Network provide local
support to prevention practitioners and other community 
members interested in addressing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
problems.<P>

<STRONG>RADAR Network Centers</STRONG><P>

RADAR Network Centers are located in every State and U.S.
Territory. Coordinated through NCADI, regular RADAR Network Centers
services are available to all community members. Services
include:<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Helping people find accurate and up-to-date information about
prevention as well as effective materials and programs that can be
adapted for their communities.
 <LI>Providing posters, booklets, and other materials with
prevention and intervention messages for youth, parents, and other
target audiences. Some of these products are offered in bulk for
distribution to groups, while others are camera-ready for
reproduction. Almost all materials are in the public domain and
community members are encouraged to reproduce and distribute
copies.
 <LI>Promoting and supporting outreach efforts to groups at high
risk (e.g., children of alcoholics and other drug abusers,
dropouts, pregnant teens, low-income families, juvenile
delinquents, youths with disabilities, suicidal teens, and those
with mental health problems).
 <LI>Responding to questions about prevention and intervention by
mail or telephone and assisting visitors by providing hands-on
assistance.
 <LI>Helping prevention practitioners design and implement programs
tailored to meet the special needs of their communities. This
includes assistance with services and materials that are culturally
sensitive and age-appropriate.
</UL><P>

RADAR Network Centers work closely with CSAP, NCADI, CSAP grantees,
and each other through an electronic communications system
(PREVline) that allows for the ready exchange of information and
ideas, facilitating an unprecedented level of interstate
cooperation on prevention issues. The system is available 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week.<P>

In addition to State RADAR Network Centers designated by State
governments, the network includes Specialty RADAR Network Centers
that operate at the national level, associate members that work at
the community level, and international organizations.<P>

<STRONG>Specialty RADAR Network Centers</STRONG><P>

Specialty RADAR Network Centers are national organizations and
Federal agencies that focus on specific alcohol, tobacco, and other
drug issues. For example, National Families in Action might help a
caller track how the media is covering a specific alcohol, tobacco,
and other drugs related issue.<P>

<STRONG>Associate RADAR Network Members</STRONG><P>

Associate members are organizations that conduct information and
referral services at the community level. In addition to serving
the public, associate members assist and support the RADAR Network
Centers in their activities.<P>

<STRONG>International RADAR Network Members</STRONG><P>

Other countries are interested in information exchange with the
United States. Some have established International RADAR Network
Centers and have sent representatives to NCADI to learn how to set
up similar clearinghouse activities.<P>

<STRONG>Using the RADAR Network</STRONG><P>

Anyone may use the services offered by the RADAR Network. For the
location of the nearest RADAR Network Center or for membership
information, contact:<BR>

<h2><a name=Techn>Grantwriting Technical Assistance</h2></a>
<p>
The IPRC provides a wide range of grantwriting assistance to ATOD prevention programs in 
Indiana, including assistance in locating potential funding sources, development of proposal 
writing skills, proposal writing and critiquing assistance, and sponsorship of week-long 
grantwriting training workshops conducted by the staff of The Grantsmanship Center.  
Technical assistance services are provided without charge to Indiana-based prevention 
programs.  Participants in the week-long  proposal writing workshops pay a minimal charge 
for meals and refreshment breaks, but the cost of materials and the training is absorbed by the 
Indiana Prevention Resource Center.
<p>
Grantwriting Technical Assistance services include:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> research assistance locating potential funding sources
<li> research assistance locating potential partner agencies and consultants
<li> review and critique of proposal drafts
<li> assistance in identifying and locating instructional information on program planning and 
proposal writing
</ul>
<p>
We have extensive print references, and on-line and CD-ROM databases on potential 
governmental, foundation, and corporate funding sources.  We also can provide detailed 
profiles of foundation sources, along with information on funding restrictions, contact people 
and submission procedures.  These reference services are provided without charge to Indiana-
based prevention programs.
<p>
Indiana applicants who are eligible to apply for large federal or foundation grants may request 
our intensive grantwriting assistance.  This service includes up to 200 hours of proposal 
writing, typing and duplicating, and proposal submission services.  Due to staff limitations, 
only a limited number of the most promising PREVENTION proposals are selected to receive 
this intensive level of service.
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h2><a name=Intensive>Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service is to increase the amount of 
funding for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug <b>prevention</b> programs available in the 
State of Indiana, by providing grantwriting technical assistance to qualified applicant agencies, 
and assisting them in developing fundable grant applications and contract proposals for federal 
agencies, foundations, or corporations.
<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center will select six to eight grassroots <b>prevention 
</b> organizations per year, that have a project with a high probability of receiving funding, 
to receive this exceptional level of assistance.
<p>
Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Services include up to 200 hours of technical assistance 
services such as:<br>
<ul>
<li> assessment of local readiness to proceed with a full proposal or application
<li> development of concept and funding strategy
<li> consultation on information-gathering tasks
<li> development of local coalitions and partnerships
<li> preparation of draft application or proposal
<li> preparation of budget and final application or proposal documents
<li> compliance monitoring for all technical rules and regulations
<li> typing, duplication, and submission services.
</ul>
<p>
The Intensive Grantwriting Assistance Service is limited to applications for competitive or 
"sole source" programs (not "formula grant" or entitlement programs) and must be of 
sufficient size, scope, and duration to warrant 200 hours of technical assistance.
<p>
Applicant agency must be a viable candidate to receive a federal or foundation grant award 
(incorporated entity with a good track record and acceptable fiscal and management control, 
and able to provide or acquire the technical expertise in needs assessment, planning, 
implementation, and evaluation of the project).

<h2><a name=Course>The Grantsmanship Center's Proposal Writing Workshop 
</a></h2>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center, in cooperation with the National Training Team from 
<b> The Grantsmanship Center, </b> sponsors a five-day Granstmanship Proposal Writing 
Workshop twice each year, to improve the grantwriting capacity of Indiana prevention 
professionals.  The usual cost of enrolling in this workshop, when purchased from The 
Grantsmanship Center, is approximately $800, including meals and materials.  Qualified 
prevention professionals from Indiana may participate in the IPRC-sponsored workshops for a 
minimal fee of $100 for meals and refreshment breaks.  The cost of materials and the training 
is absorbed by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center.  Each workshop is limited to a 
maximum enrollment of 25 persons.
<p>
The next workshop is scheduled for the week of June 17 through 21 in Indianapolis.
<p>
The fall workshop has not yet been scheduled, but will likely be in August or September, at a location 
to be announced, possibly in Northwest Indiana if there is enough interest in this location.
<p>
For further information on this week-long workshop, contact the IPRC.

<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center hasts a specially-tailored version of <b> The
Grantsmanship Center</b>'s five-day Proposal Writing Workshop, to help develop
proposal writing capacity in alcohol and other drug prevention professionals.  
<b><i>This special version of the workshop focuses specifically on developing
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) prevention proposals to federal and
foundation funding sources.</i></b>  The lead trainer is V.C. League, a
nationally recognized expert in ATOD issues, who has trained for The 
Grantsmanship Center for more than 20 years.
<p>
Designed for both the novice and the experienced grant seeker, this workshop
covers all aspects of researching for grants, writing grant proposals, and
negotiating with funding sources.  The program teaches the use of the Center's
proposal writing format, the most widely used in the world.  During the class,
you will search out funding for your agency using a wealth of materials
available at the workshop.  With a team you will also develop a proposal for 
your agency or help a classmate develop a proposal.  You will leave this
workshop possessing new skills and understanding how to apply these skills
to the needs of your own organization.
<p>
<h3>The Workshop Agenda</h3>
This is an intensive five-day program combining instruction and practical
exercises to take you step-by-step through all the stages of writing a
grant proposal.  In the first part of the workshop you will learn all the
essentials of proposal writing.  Working on your own, and in small groups,
you'll develop and critique proposal elements -- focusing on your own agency.  
You will also serve as a panelist, evaluating a proposal brought to class by 
a participant -- or bring in your own proposal for review.
<p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
The Grantsmanship Center's usual registration fee for this workshop is $595 
per trainee for the trainig, plus registrants pay at least $100 for meals 
and breaks.  The Indiana Prevention Resource Center offers this training
for a total cost of $100, to partially cover the expenses of melas and
breaks.  The fee is non-refundable.  The remaining funding is provided by 
the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration - Division of 
Mental Health.  <b>Participants are responsible for providing their own
transportation to the training site, lodging, and evening meal expenses.</b>
<p>
Each workshop is limited to 25 participants, who are assigned to 
five-person workgorups to assure personal attention for each participant.  
Enrollment is limited to no more than two trainees per agency, and may
be apportioned by the IPRC to assure geographic equity within Indiana.
<hr>
<i><b>The Grantsmanship Center</b></i> is the world's oldest amd largest
fundraising training organization.  Founded in 1972, the Center has trained 
more than 50,000 staff members from nonprofit and government agencies.  
A two-year long evaluation of this program found that an average of 
$177,000 per person in new grants and contracts has been attributed to
this program by a group of 872 graduates.

<p>
<b>GATEWAY DRUGS</b> are drugs that serve as the "gate" or path that almost always 
precedes the use of illicit drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and LSD.  These gateway 
drugs serve as almost essential precursors to the use of other drugs, and often lead to adoption 
of the drug-using lifestyle.  Gateway drugs, or drugs-of-entry, serve to initiate a novice user to 
the drug-using world.
<p>
Heroin addicts rarely, if ever, begin their drug use with heroin -- they start with gateway 
drugs, such as tobacco, and then progress (or regress) to heroin. While not all users of 
gateway drugs progress to heroin or cocaine, many do, and it is not possible to predict which 
users will progress to heroin and which will not.
<p>
The common gateway drugs include: <b>tobacco, alcohol, inhalants</b>, and 
<b>anabolic steroids.</b>   Use of these drugs is statistically linked with later progression 
to other drugs.  The linkage is not biochemical, however.
<p>
Despite the fact that <b>TOBACCO</b> smoke contains hundreds of toxic chemicals, 
none of them cause smokers to try marijuana or cocaine.  The gateway drugs serve as social 
and psychological precursors to the use of other drugs.  The decisions to use tobacco or other 
gateway drugs set up <b>patterns of behavior</b> that make it easier for a user to go on 
to the other drugs.  It is the series of decisions made by the smoker that make decisions to use 
other drugs easier.  Social psychologists refer to this phenomenon as a "developmental 
progression."  Children who decide to accept the risks of smoking later find it much easier to 
accept the risks of using other drugs.
<p>
On the other hand, children who make conscious decisions to avoid smoking tobacco because 
of the health risks are very unlikely to later make a decision to smoke marijuana, because 
accepting the health risks of smoking marijuana would be psychologically inconsistent with the 
values and beliefs of a non-tobacco smoker.
<p>
While the link is not biochemical, it is powerful nonetheless.  How powerful is the influence of 
tobacco use on future use of illegal drugs?  In 1987, a research team from the University of 
Michigan's Institute for Social Research found that among high-school seniors, daily smokers 
were <b>10 times more likely to use cocaine regularly</b> than were seniors who never 
had smoked regularly!  Students who never smoked were much less likely to experiment with 
controlled substances such as heroin and LSD, and very unlikely to use them regularly.  
However, nearly one-fourth of the seniors who smoked cigarettes daily had used cocaine in the 
month before the survey!






<p>
The Michigan study examined five different levels of smoking history and use of 15 different 
drugs.  The evidence was overwhelming that cigarette-smoking high school seniors were much 
more likely to use every class of controlled substance (but only slightly more likely to use 
alcohol) than were non-smoking students.
<p>
The link is dose-related -- the more cigarettes a student smoked, the more likely he or she was 
to use marijuana and cocaine.  For example, while less than 4 percent of the high school 
seniors who never had smoked tried cocaine one or more times during their senior year of high 
school, more than 40 percent of the seniors who smoked a pack a day or more had tried 
cocaine during the year.  Only 7.2 percent of the non-smoking seniors used marijuana during 
the month before the survey, as compared with 59 percent of the pack-a-day smokers.  (More 
detailed data are provided in the accompanying charts.) 
<p>
[Reference: Johnston, O'Malley, and  Bachman, 1987.]
<p>
The role of <b>ALCOHOL</b> as a gateway drug is a little more complex.  The 
statistical link between alcohol use and use of illicit drugs is age and dose related.  Alcohol use 
by children and young adolescents serves as a precursor to and predictor of future use of illicit 
drugs, while alcohol use that begins after the age of 16 does not appear to be linked directly 
with use of other illicit drugs.  The child who begins using alcohol in the late elementary 
grades or during junior high school is much more likely to later use such drugs as cocaine, 
marijuana, and LSD, while the person who begins drinking later in adolescence is no more 
likely than non-drinkers to use other illicit drugs.  Those who drink heavily, or who regularly 
"binge drink" (drink to the point of intoxication at least once every two weeks) are more likely 
to use controlled substances than are non-drinkers or moderate drinkers.
<p>
<b>INHALANTS</b> are drugs whose fumes or vapors are inhaled for their intoxicating 
effect.  They include such substances as gasoline, lighter fluid, tool-cleaning solvents, model 
airplane glue, typewriter correction fluid, and even fumes from permanent magic markers.  
Particularly in the Midwest, inhalants often are the first drug used by children to produce an 
intoxicating effect.  In some communities, as many as one-fourth of all late elementary grades 
students regularly use inhalants to get high.  Statistically, those children who use inhalants are 
much more likely to use other illicit drugs than are non-inhalant users.
<p>
Recently, the use of <b>ANABOLIC STEROIDS</b> by some students has been shown to 
produce the gateway drug effect.  Steroids are used to build muscle bulk.  Often, steroid users 
combine a regimen of pills and injectable forms of the drug.  Some steroid users learn to 
accept the risks of using injectable drugs and of regularly taking pills.  The psychological 
conditioning that accompanies acceptance of these risks can lead to accepting the risks 
associated with other drug use.
<p>
Some social scientists believe that the gateway drug phenomenon is simply an example of 
practice conditioning that leads to the development of a learned behavior.  Children who 
experiment with and later use gateway drugs are, in effect, practicing the wrong social skills 
and learning the wrong behaviors.  They then apply these conditioned behaviors to other, more 
sinister drugs.
<p>
One of the problems with this approach is the possible minimization of the risks associated 
with the gateway drugs themselves.  Tobacco and alcohol themselves cause nearly one-third of 
<b>all deaths</b> from all causes in the United States.  More people die from tobacco and 
alcohol use each month than die in an entire year from use of all other illicit drugs combined.
<p>
From a public policy standpoint, tobacco and alcohol prevention programs are essential in their 
own right.  They help mitigate the adverse impact that the two deadliest drugs have on our 






society.  But tobacco and alcohol prevention programs also are important as a means of 
preventing use of other drugs.  Prevention of cocaine and heroin use begins with preventing 
tobacco use!  If children learn to make good decisions not to use gateway drugs, they are very 
unlikely to begin using controlled substances.

<h3>Gateway Drugs in Indiana</h3><br>
<p>
The University of Michigan study cited above was limited to high school seniors.  
An analysis of the 1992 Indiana Prevention Resource Center survey of alcohol,
tobacco, and other drug use by Indiana children and adolescents showed that the
gateway drug effect is even more pronounced at younger ages.  The survey 
analyzed the responses of 30,629 Indiana students in grades 5 to 12 from 88
schools in 25 communities.  It demonstrated that pack-a-day smokers were:
<ul>
<li> 3 times more likely than nonsmokers to use alcohol;
<li> 7 times more likely than nonsmokers to use smokeless tobacco;
<li> 45 times more likely than nonsmokers to use marijuana;
<li> 79 times more likely than nonsmokers to use cocaine; and
<li> 10 to 80 times more likely than nonsmokers to use other drugs.
</ul>
<p>
The table below shows the percentage of Indiana students who reported use of
the named drug at least once in the year prior to survey, classified by
smoking status.  For a more detailed discussion, and more complete data
tables, see Torabi, Bailey and Majd-Jabbari, 1993.

<B>MARIJUANA</B> 
<P>
Marijuana is one of the most controversial drugs in American society.
<P>
Many believe it to be a menace to society, while others assert
that it is no more harmful than an occasional drink of alcohol.
Still others view marijuana as something in between.
<P>
Marijuana is the powerful drug made from <I>cannabis sativa</I>
-- commonly known as the hemp plant -- that is smoked for its
intoxicating effects. The primary active ingredient in marijuana
is <B>delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol</B> (THC), and it is this complex
chemical that produces most of the psychoactive (mind-altering)
reactions experienced by marijuana users. The level of THC determines
the potency of the drug. This level can range from 0.01 to 10
percent, the latter being 1,000 times more potent than the former.
<P>
<img src = "/graphics/photographs/drugs/marip.jpg" align = right>
Most often, marijuana is prepared using the dried flowers and
leaves of the hemp plant. Other related drugs made from the hemp
plant are hashish, made from the plant resin, and hash oil, which
is made from an oily extract of either hashish or marijuana. These
drugs usually are smoked in cigarettes (&quot;joints&quot;) or
pipes, or they are baked into brownies or cookies. Common slang
terms for marijuana include &quot;grass,&quot; &quot;weed,&quot;
&quot;pot,&quot; and &quot;dope.&quot;
<P>

Marijuana is, by far, the most widely used controlled substance in the
United States. Use of marijuana by children and adolescents has
increased dramatically over the last three years. According to the
National High School Senior Survey (<i>Monitoring the Future study</i>),
lifetime use by high school seniors declined from the 1979 peak of
60.4% to a low of 32.6% in 1992, but has increased sharply in each of
the last three years to reach 41.7% in 1995. Use in the past month by
high school seniors increased from 11.9% in 1992 to 21.2% in 1995. In
the annual Indiana survey conducted by the Indiana Prevention Resource
Center, lifetime use by high school seniors increased from 31.0% to
40.0% between 1992 and 1995, at the same time that monthly use
increased from 14.4% to 24.0%. Monthly use by Indiana 10th graders in
1995 was 21.5%, and was 13.1% by 8th graders, both substantially
higher than national averages.

<B>HEALTH CONSEQUENCES: </B>
<P>
<img align = right src = "/graphics/photographs/drugs/j.jpg">
Marijuana is highly fat soluble, and thus it is absorbed readily
and will accumulate in the brain, liver, lungs and reproductive
organs. These parts of the body are covered by fatty membranes.
As a result of this storage within the body, marijuana poses serious
danger because its effects may persist for several days or even
weeks, with chronic use.
<P>
Several facts about marijuana smoking have produced persistent
concern about its effects on the respiratory system. First, marijuana
is smoked &quot;unfiltered,&quot; and the cigarette is consumed
almost entirely. Also, marijuana is deeply inhaled, and when it
is smoked, the smoke is held in the lungs for several seconds.
Marijuana smoke contains carbon
monoxide, nitrosamines, benzopyrene, and over 60 cannabinoid compounds.
All of these are respiratory irritants and potential carcinogens.
Long-term use has been shown to produce precancerous cell changes and
several recent studies suggest that marijuana smoking can lead to lung
cancer.
Users have reported symptoms such as hoarseness, coughing, laryngitis
and bronchitis.
<P>
In addition to irritation of the respiratory system, specific
physical effects of marijuana use include increased pulse and
heart rate, and with chronic use, impairment of the immune system.
Also, there is evidence that regular marijuana use may damage
the reproductive system, including reducing sperm production and
decreasing estrogen production, and causing menstrual or ovulatory
irregularities. Research on marijuana use during pregnancy is
inconclusive, although like most substances, marijuana crosses the
placental barrier. Evidence suggests that marijuana use during
pregnancy may be sufficient to produce permanent fetal abnormalities,
and if combined with other drug use, inadequate prenatal care
or malnourishment, harm to the fetus may increase greatly.
<P>
Marijuana also produces inability to complete psychomotor tasks.
Driving performance is impaired, due to altered perception of
space and time, and reduced ability to make quick decisions. Marijuana
intoxication interferes with other skills such as communicating,
or recalling verbal or graphic material from short-term memory.
The degree of impairment depends on the dose and potency of the
drug, the individual's tolerance, and the complexity of the task.
<P>
Many feelings experienced by marijuana users are subjective in
nature. Feelings may include euphoria, relaxation and hilarity,
and negative psychological reactions include panic attacks, anxiety
and hallucinations. Although it is difficult to measure objectively,
researchers have expressed concern over marijuana's effects on
motivation. A picture has emerged of <I>amotivational syndrome</I>,
which can be described as a massive and persistent loss of ambition
that is replaced by chronic apathy and passivity toward goals
and the future. Amotivational syndrome is seen most frequently
in heavy marijuana users.
<P>
Tolerance to a drug develops when increasing doses of a drug are
required to produce the same effect. If marijuana use is infrequent
or doses are small, tolerance to the drug is not apparent. After
prolonged use, however, it is necessary to ingest more marijuana
to produce the same feelings. The fact that the body stores THC
may be a factor in developing tolerance.
<P>
Physical dependence is manifested when an interruption of drug
use produces physical withdrawal symptoms. It is believed that marijuana
is not physically addictive, except in extremely high doses that
are atypical of the majority of users. But because of the &quot;good
feeling&quot; and instant gratification that marijuana can produce,
psychological dependence is a very real consequence. Moreover,
the lack of motivation that also is experienced by regular users
may make it even more difficult to discontinue using marijuana.

<a name="legal">
<B>LEGAL ISSUES: </B>
<P>
U.S. and Indiana laws classify marijuana a Schedule I Controlled
Substance, which means:
<P>
1. Marijuana has a high potential for abuse.
<P>
2. There is no currently accepted medical use for marijuana in
the United States.
<P>
3. There are no accepted safety guidelines for marijuana use.
<P>
Under Indiana and federal laws, it is illegal to use, possess,
cultivate or sell marijuana. Following is a summary of Indiana
laws about marijuana.
<P>
Delivering or manufacturing marijuana, hash oil or hashish, or
possessing marijuana, hash oil or hashish with the intent to sell
it is a Class A misdemeanor. The usual penalty for a Class A misdemeanor
is up to one year in prison and a maximum fine of $5,000.
<P>
Possessing, cultivating or failing to destroy existing marijuana
plants are also Class A misdemeanors, which carry the same penalty
as described above.
<P>
Delivering marijuana to a minor is a Class D felony, which carries
a sentence of one to four years and a maximum fine of $10,000.
<P>
Delivering marijuana within 1,000 feet of school property or on
a school bus is a Class C felony. The usual sentence for a Class
C felony is two to eight years and a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Classes of offenses also vary depending on the amount of marijuana,
hashish or hash oil involved. Penalties may also be increased
if an individual previously has been convicted for an offense
involving marijuana, hash oil or hashish.

<hr>
The  scenario seems right out of some science fiction nightmare.  A dangerous  addictive  drug 
that  is  cheap  and  easy to manufacture appears out of nowhere and  creates  a  potential  drug 
crisis.   The  drug  is concocted from a "witches brew" of battery acid,  Drano,  and  over-the-
counter asthma medication, and can be manufactured in home kitchens.
<p>
Unfortunately, it isn't science fiction.  It isn't fiction.  It is Indiana's most recent drug threat -- 
methcathinone.   Since  1991  or  1992, this new drug has emerged as  a  cheap  substitute  for 
methamphetamine.  Since it is so new, all of the risks have not yet been assessed.  But lack  of 
information about risks has not stopped its use in Indiana.

<p>
The ingredients used in various recipes for home-made methcathinone include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (found in some over-the-counter asthma and cold 
medications)
<li> acetone (explosive paint solvent)
<li> muriatic acid (used in sandblasting and cleaning mortar off bricks)
<li> sulfuric acid (usually purchased from auto supply stores as battery acid)
<li> lye (usually in the form of a crystal drain cleaner such as Drano)
<li> sodium dichromate or potassium dichromate
<li> sodium hydroxide
<li> toulene (explosive paint thinner)
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name=History><h3>History of Methcathinone </h3></a>
<p>
Methcathinone is a derivative of a naturally-occurring stimulant drug, cathinone, which is 
found in the "khat" plant, <i> Cathula edulis</i>, which is native to the horn of Africa 
and southern Arabian peninsula.  It was first synthesized in Germany in 1928, and used in the 
Soviet Union as an anti-depressant during the 1930's and 1940's.  Abuse of methcathinone, 
also known as "ephedrone," "Jeff," or "Mulka," has been reported in the Soviet Union since 
the late 1960's.
<p>
In the mid-1950's, American pharmaceutical manufacturer Parke Davis & Company conducted 
preliminary studies on methcathinone to determine if it had any medicinal potential.  Although 
Parke Davis soon abandoned its methcathinone research, after determining that there were 
unacceptable safety risks and substantial side effects, their studies revealed that it had 
physiologic effects similar to amphetamine.  Methcathinone reemerged in this country in 1989, 
when a University of Michigan student who was interning at Parke Davis stumbled across and 
stole samples of the drug and documentation of the manufacturing process.  In 1990, associates 
of that student began manufacturing and selling the drug in clandestine laboratories in northern 
Michigan.  Its use became popular in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1990 and 1991, and 
quickly spread statewide.  As of 1995, methcathinone laboratories have been discovered in ten 
states, from Colorado through the Midwest.  It has quickly become one of the biggest 
challenges faced by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
<p>
Methcathinone was classified a a schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled 
Substances Act on May 1, 1992, under the emergency scheduling procedure.  The 
classification was made permanent effective October 15, 1993.
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>






<a name=Effects><h3>Effects of Methcathinone Intoxication</h3></a>
<p>
The most common means of taking methcathinone is snorting (nasal insufflation).  Other routes 
of administration include taking it by mouth (oral ingestion) mixed in a liquid such as coffee or 
soft drinks, intravenous injection, and smoking it either in a crack pipe or added to tobacco or 
marijuana cigarettes.  Methcathinone is often used in binges lasting from two to six days, 
during which methcathinone is used repeatedly.
<p>
Effects  of short term intoxication are similar to those produced by crack cocaine  or  
methamphetamine:   stimulation  of  heart  rate and respiration; feeling of  euphoria;  loss  of  appetite; 
increased  alertness; pupils may be dilated; body temperature may be slightly elevated.   Acute 
intoxication at higher doses may also result in: insomnia, tremors and muscle twitching,  fever, 
headaches,  convulsions, irregular heart rate and respirations, anxiety,  restlessness,  paranoia, 
and hallucinations and delusions.
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name=Problems><h3>Problems Associated with Methcathinone Use</h3><a/>
<p>
While research on the long-term effects of methcathinone use is just beginning in the United 
States, anecdotal reports from users in treatment in this country, and from published research 
in Russia, paint a similar picture.  Chronic use of methcathinone produces a range of problems 
typical of addiction to powerful stimulant drugs including:
<p>
<ul>
<li> paranoia and delusions
<li> hallucinations, including a sensation of bugs crawling under the skin
<li> anxiety followed by depression
<li> tremors and convulsions
<li> anorexia, malnutrition, and weight loss
<li> sweating, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance
<li> stomach pains and nausea
<li> nose bleeding and eventual destruction of nasal tissues and erosion of the nasal septum
<li> elevated blood pressure and heart rate
<li> body aches
</ul>
<p>
In addition, following a binge, users report a "crash" that often includes severe psychological 
depression, and suicide ideation.
<p>
Anecdotal reports from patients in treatment facilities in Michigan and Wisconsin suggest that 
methcathinone is highly addictive, similar to crack cocaine, and some users report developing 
tolerance and withdrawal symptoms after just one incident of binging (six to ten days) on 
methcathinone.  Addiction to methcathinone appears to be as difficult to treat as addiction to 
crack cocaine.
<p>
Data from Russia report that many methcathinone addicts suffer permanent brain damage and 
exhibit symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.
<p>
In extreme cases, deaths have been reported, and are related to heart failure, lethal overdoses, 
drug-related violence, and manufacturing accidents.
<p>
<p>
<hr>






<p>
<a name=Legal><h3>Legal Issues and Methcathinone</h3></a>
<p>
When methcathinone appeared on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1990, there were no 
federal or state laws specifically regulating its possession and sale, although it was banned 
under the "designer drug" (controlled substances analog) provisions of the federal Controlled 
Substances Act.  On May 1, 1992, the DEA took emergency action, and temporarily classified 
methcathinone as a Schedule I controlled substance, based upon a finding that emergency 
action was warranted to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.  After public hearings 
and a scientific review, this classification was made permanent, effective October 15, 1993.
<p>
In Indiana, methcathinone had been classified as a Schedule I controlled substance [IC 35-48-2-
4-(f)].  It is a felony to possess or sell a Schedule I controlled substance in Indiana.  Depending 
upon drug quantity, the age of the purchaser, and the location of the sale, penalties could range 
up to 40 years in prison for sale of methcathinone.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name=Indiana><h3>Methcathinone Use in Indiana</h3></a>
<p>
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported the seizure of four clandestine 
methcathinone laboratories in Indiana in September, 1993.  Since that time, more than two 
dozen additional laboratories have been seized by police, primarily in South Central Indiana.  
<p>
An explosion and fatal fire near Lake Monroe, south of Bloomington, on January 9, 1995, 
appears to be related to methcathinone manufacturing.  One man was killed and another was 
seriously burned in the explosion which destroyed 11 condominium units valued at more than 
$1 million.  Police allege that the two were involved in a clandestine lab which blew up during 
the manufacturing process.  Two other persons also were charged in the incident.
<p>
Another fire at a public housing apartment in Bloomington, on May 3, 1995, is alleged to be 
the result of an exploding methcathinone laboratory.  At least one arrest has been made in that 
incident.  Other laboratories were raided in Gosport on March 10, 1995, in Spencer on April 
7, 1995, and in Springville, on May 16, 1995.
<p>
The drug is relatively easy to manufacture, from commonly available materials, and can 
produce quick profits.  Five hundred dollars worth of raw materials and containers and 
equipment commonly found in home kitchens can produce drugs valued at $20,000 to $50,000 
on the street market.  Instructions can be found in many counterculture publications and is 
easily available over the Internet.
<p>
Due to the relatively recent emergence of this drug, there are no reliable statistics on the 
prevalence  of  methcathinone use in Indiana.  Based upon police observations, its use  is  still  quite 
rare, and lifetime use would certainly be below 1% of the population.
<p>
In Indiana, methcathinone is usually seen as a white or off-white powder sold in gram-sized 
portions at a cost of $75 to $100, or in smaller, single dose quantities ranging from 1/10 to 1/4 
gram.  It is usually snorted, and is usually more than 90% pure.  Due to the nature of 
clandestine drug manufacturing, and its lack of quality controls, substantial adulteration with 
residues of the manufacturing process is common.  Residues include traces of unprocessed 
ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, caustic acids, lye, talcum, and other chemical residues.  The 
presence of each of these substances presents additional risks to the user.

<p>

A familiar stimulant drug, long used to treat hyperactivity in children,
is quickly becoming the drug abuse "hot topic" in the American Midwest.  
Reports of <b><i>Ritalin</i> (methylphenidate) </b> abuse have taken 
center stage in television specials and news magazine articles in the
fall of 1995.  Prescription tablets, which produce mild stimulant effects
when taken as directed and at usual prescription doses, can create
powerful stimulant effects and serious health risks when crushed and
then snorted like cocaine, or injected like heroin.
<p>
Producing cocaine-like stimulant effects, snorted or injected <i>Ritalin </i>
is just the latest trend in a resurgence in abuse of stimulant drugs that 
recalls the "Speed Freak" era of the late 1960's.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="pattern">
<h3>PATTERN OF NON-MEDICAL USE</h3>
<p>
<i>Ritalin</i> (methylphenidate) is manufactured by CIBA-Geigy Corporation, 
and is supplied in 5 mg., 10 mg., and 20 mg. tablets, and in a sustained
release form, <i> Ritalin SR </i> as 20 mg. tablets.  It is readily 
water soluble and is intended for oral use.  Many non-medical users, however,
crush the tablets and either snort the resulting powder, or disolve it in
waterand "cook" it for intravenous injection.  It is a Schedule II Controlled Substance
under both the federal and Indiana Controlled Substances Acts.
<p>
In medicine, Ritalin is used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) 
(also known as Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), formerly called
Minimal Brain Dysfunction) and in the treatment of narcolepsy.  In recent
years, the frequency of diagnosis for attention deficit disorder has
increased dramatically, especially since adults are now diagnosed with
this disorder that had previously been considered a children-only disease.
Prescriptions for Ritalin have increased more than 600% over the past
five years according to the DEA, and a significant portion of these 
prescriptions are diverted for illicit non-medical use.  
<p>
Since Ritalin is a Schedule II Controlled Substance, the federal government
strictly regulates the amount that may be manufactured, through a system
of rigid manufacturing quotas.  Over the past several years, as ADD diagnoses
increased, the manufacturing quotas have not increased sufficiently to
allow for the increased demand.  This has led to sporadic and regional
shortages of Ritalin.  Diversions of drugs into the illicit street drug
trade increases the shortages of the drug for legitimate medical purposes.
<p>
When purchased in pharmacies with a valid prescription, Ritalin tablets usually cost 
25 cents to 50 cents each.  In the illicit street drug market, tablets sell 
for $3 to $15 each.  While street prices in the Midwest are now at the low
end ($3 to $5 per tablet) compared with some West Coast locations, 
they have been rising over the past few years.
<p>
At a December, 1994 meeting of the Community Epidemiology Work Group, a
drug use epidemiology forum, an upsurge in illicit street use of Ritalin
was reported on the U.S. West Coast and in the Midwest.  Snorting of
crushed Ritalin tablets and intraveous injection of a solution made from 
Ritalin tablets were reported at both Midwestern reporting sites: Chicago
and Detroit.  Anecdotal reports suggest that suburban and white abusers
are somewhat more likely to snort Ritalin, while black inner-city abusers
are somewhat more likely to inject it.
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>Chicago: "The most intensive stimulant abusers...are those who prefer
to inject...white IDUs on the North Side are reported to inject phenmetrazine
HCl (Preludin)...black stimulant suers on the South Side prefer 
methylphenidate (italin), or "west coast." </i>
<h6> CEWG, Epidemiologic Trends in Drug Abuse, NIDA, 1995.</h6>
</blockquote>
<p>
Epidemiologists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse describe Ritalin 
abuse over the last two decades as "sporadic but persistent," and rates
of use fluctuate over time.   
<hr>
<p>


<a name="health">
<h3>HEALTH CONSEQUENCES</h3>
<i><b>Ritalin</b></i> (methylphenidate) is a central nervous system 
stimulant, similar to amphetamines in the nature and duration of its 
effects.  It is believed that it works by activating the brain stem arousal
system and cortex.  Pharmacologically, it works on the neurotransmitter
dopamine, and in that respect resembles the stimulant characteristics of
cocaine.  When taken in accordance with usual prescription instructions,
it would be classified as having mild to moderate stimulant properties,
but when snorted or injected it has a strong stimulant effect.
<p>
Even when taken according to the prescription directions, there is a risk
of developing dependence and tolerance to the drug.  The manufacturer
cautions physicians to be on the lookout for the following adverse
effects:
<ul>
<li> nervousness and insomnia;
<li> loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting;
<li> dizziness, palpitatons, headaches;
<li> changes in heart rate and blood pressure (usually elevation of both,
but occasionally depression);
<li> skin rashes and itching;
<li> abdominal pain, weight loss, and digestive problems;
<li> toxic psychosis, psychotic episodes, drug dependence syndrome; and
<li> severe depression upon withdrawal.
</ul><p>
High doses of stimulants produce a predictable set of symptoms that
include:
<ul>
<li> loss of appetite (may cause serious malnutrition);
<li> tremors and muscle twitching;
<li> fevers, convulsions, and headaches (may be severe);
<li> irregular heartbeat and respirations (may be profound and life threatening);
<li> anxiety, restlessness;
<li> paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions;
<li> excessive repetition of movements and meaningless tasks; and
<li> formicaton (sensation of bugs or worms crawling under the skin).
</ul>
While death due to non-medical use of Ritalin is not common, it has been
known to occur.
<p>

In order to make the 5- to 20 mg. dose tablets large enough to handle
easily, at least 100 mg. of "inert ingredients" are added to the tablets
to increase their size.  Depending upon size and formulation, the following
inert ingredients are found in Ritalin tablets, according to the
manufacturer:  lactose, starch, polyethelene glycol, magnesium stearate,
sucrose, talc, cellulose, mineral oil, and various dyes and conditioning
agents.  While these ingredients are "inert" when taken by mouth, they 
can cause serious problems when injected or snorted.


<h4>Health Consequences of Intravenous and/or Injection Drug Use</h4>

The hypodermic syringe was designed to deliver a concentrated dose of a
drug quickly and efficiently.  In doing so, it bypasses many of the body's
natural defense mechanisms such as the skin, respiratory cilia, digestive
acids, etc.  The syringe allows anything in it (drugs, dust, bacteria,
pollen, allergens, yeasts, viruses, fillers, etc.) to pass directly into
the blood and body tissues.  The rapid delivery of drugs via injection makes
it difficult for the user to control the intensity of the drug effect, thus
making toxic overdoses more likely.
<p>
When drugs are prepared for injection by a street user, dust, dirt, and
other contaminants fall into the liquid.  Bacteria, talc, lint, and other
particles are injected along with the drug.  The "inert ingredients" that
manufacturers include to increase the bulk may be harmless when taken by
mouth, but talc, cellulose, mineral oil, and sugars (among other fillers)
can create serious problems when injected directly into veins or body
tissues.  Complications from injection drug use include:
<ul>
<li> drug overdoses and toxic overdose reactions;
<li> blood clots from scar tissue, particles in the liquid, cotton and lint
fibers, etc.;
<li> infections ("blood poisoning," abscesses, hepatitis, AIDS, etc.);
<li> scars ("tracks" and adhesions);
<li> pulmonary problems ("addict's lung," embolisms, etc.); and
<li> skin and circulatory problems.
</ul>
There are numerous reports in medical journals about permanent and 
irreversible lung tissue damage related to injection of crushed Ritalin 
tablets.

<h4> Health consequences of Snorting Drugs (Intranasal Insufflation) </h4>
The delicate epithelial tissues that line the nasal cavities and air
passages may be damaged by direct contact with drugs.  Ritalin tablets
contain the hydrochloride salt of methylphenidate and yield dilute 
hydrochloric acid when they come into contact with moisture.  While this
is not a problem in the stomach (hydrochloric acid is one of the digestive
acids used in the stomach), in the nasal passages the acid can "burn" the
delicate nasal tissues, resulting in open sores, nose bleeds, and possibly
in deterioration of the nasal cartilage.
<p>

<hr>
<p>
<a name="legal">
<h3>LEGAL ISSUES</h3>
Ritalin (methylphenidate) is a Schedule II Controlled Substance under both
the federal and Indiana's Controlled Substances Acts.  As such, it is
tightly regulated, from manufacture to receipt by a patient.  Schedule II
drugs are covered by strict manufacturing quotas, careful inventory controls
that require special order forms, and separate recordkeeping requirements.  
Prescriptions may not be refilled -- a new prescription is required for 
additional supplies.  Prescriptions must be in writing, and limited to
an amount sufficient for one month plus one week, if used in accordance
with the prescribing instructions.  In Indiana, Ritalin prescriptions
must be in writing, and on special, numbered, three-part prescription forms
that permit tracking supplies.
<p>
Under both federal and state law, dealing in or distributing Ritalin is a
serious felony.  Possession without a prescription is a felony under
Indiana law as well.  Depending upon the quantity, location of transfer,
and age of the recipient, dealing in Ritalin could be a Class A Felony
resulting in a prison term of up to 45 years, and a fine of up to $10,000,
under Indiana law.
<p>
Indiana law is so strict that the transfer of one or two tablets from 
one student to another on school grounds can be construed as dealing 
in a controlled substance in or on school property -- a Class A Felony!  
<p>
Indiana's law provides increased penalties for dealing to minors under age
18, or dealing on or within 1000 feet of school property or a school bus;
or near pulic parks.

<P>
<B>TOBACCO</B> 
<P>
Tobacco is a substance consisting of the dried leaves and stems
of the plant <I>Nicotinia tabacum</I>, which contains the drug
<B>nicotine</B>. The plant is native to North America, but now
is grown around the world. Nicotine is a powerful nerve stimulant
and is extremely toxic. Two to three drops of pure nicotine, if
taken all at once, are enough to kill the average person. Nicotine
has been classified as the most addictive drug in existence.
<P>
There are three principal ways to consume tobacco: smoking, chewing
and dipping, and snuffing. All three ways produce approximately
equal blood nicotine levels in tobacco users.
<P>
<B><A NAME="smoking">SMOKING </A>has been identified as the single
most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States.
Approximately 50 million Americans smoke. They consume about 540
billion cigarettes each year, and each year approximately 390,000
people die from smoking-related causes. Cigarette smoke contains
more than 300 known poisons, including such deadly substances
as nicotine, arsenic, cyanide, carbon monoxide, phenol and formaldehyde.
Cigarette smoking is such an enticing habit that few smokers realize
they are addicted - until they are hooked. </B>

<a name="chew">
<P>
<B>CHEWING</B></a> looseleaf tobacco and <B>&quot;DIPPING&quot;</B>
moist, ground snuff tobacco are two common ways to use tobacco
without smoking. There are as many as 12 million chewers and dippers
in the United States who consume smokeless tobacco - many under
the mistaken impression that it is safer than cigarette smoking.
Smokeless tobacco contains powerful chemicals, including nicotine,
nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dozens of
other carcinogens, that can injure tissues in the mouth and throat.
<P>
Despite users' erroneous impressions about differing health risks
in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, the health risks presented
by smokeless tobacco use are substantial, and cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco cannot be meaningfully compared. The Surgeon General has
concluded that &quot;the oral use of smokeless tobacco represents
a significant health risk. It is not a safe substitute for smoking
cigarettes. It can cause cancer and a number of noncancerous oral
conditions and can lead to nicotine addiction and dependence.&quot;
<P>
<B><A NAME="snuff">SNUFFING </A></B>is a method of tobacco administration
rarely employed in the United States today. In snuffing, a dry
powdered tobacco is &quot;snorted&quot; and brought into contact
with the nasal passageways, and the nicotine is absorbed through
the epithelium in the upper nasal passages.<HR>

<a name="health">
<P>
<B>HEALTH ISSUES </B>
<P>
</a>
&quot;Cigarette smoking is the major single cause of cancer mortality
in the United States,&quot; according to the Surgeon General.
An estimated 30 percent of cancer deaths in the United States
are linked to smoking. These deaths are due mostly to lung cancer,
but include cancers of the larynx and oral cavity, esophagus,
bladder and kidney, pancreas, stomach and uterine cervix. Many
people fail to recognize the traumatic effect that cigarette smoke
and nicotine have on the circulatory system. Cardiovascular problems
such as high-blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and circulatory
deficiencies are common in cigarette smokers, resulting in over
170,000 deaths each year in the United States. Chronic obstructive
lung diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10
times more likely to occur in smokers than in non-smokers. Smoking
during pregnancy also poses serious risks. Spontaneous abortion,
preterm birth, low birth weights, and fetal and infant deaths
all are more likely to occur when a pregnant woman smokes.
<P>
Use of smokeless tobacco causes serious oral health problems,
such as oral cancers, leukoplakia, enamel erosion and tooth loss,
gingivitis, halitosis and gum ulcers. Because nicotine is present
in smokeless tobacco, all the cardiovascular problems associated
with cigarette smoking can develop as well.<HR>

<a name="environmental">
<P>
<B>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE </B>-- commonly referred to as
&quot;second-hand smoke&quot; -- is the nation's No. 1 airborne
carcinogen, killing more people than all other forms of air pollution
combined. This involuntary smoke is a cause of disease, including
lung cancer in healthy non-smokers. Many workplaces and other
businesses that serve the public are now considering smoking-control
ordinances to protect the health of non-smokers.
<P>
Children of smokers, forced to breathe second-hand smoke, have
more respiratory problems and miss more school than do children
of non-smokers. It is estimated that smokers' children miss about
three additional days of school per year, the equivalent of seven
weeks of school over the 12 years of primary and secondary schooling,
due to exposure to cigarette smoke in the home.
<P>
The fact that smoking cigarettes interferes with one's sense of
smell is well known, but now researchers know how serious this
effect can be. A University of Pennsylvania study reported in
the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> found that smokers
lose 15 to 20 percent of their sense of smell - enough to keep
them from detecting low concentrations of leaking gas. The study
estimated that it is not until 10 years after quitting smoking
that the sense of smell returns to its pre-smoking level.
<P>
It is never too late to quit smoking. <I>The Health Benefits of
Smoking Cessation: A Report of the Surgeon General, 1990 </I>concluded:
1) smoking cessation has major and immediate health benefits for
persons of all ages and provides benefits for persons with and
without smoking-related disease; 2) former smokers live longer
than continuing smokers; 3) smoking cessation decreases the risk
for lung and other cancers, heart attack, stroke and chronic lung
disease;
<P>
4) women who stop smoking before pregnancy or during the first
three to four months of pregnancy reduce their risk for having
a low-birth-weight infant to the same level of risk for women
who never smoked; and 5) the health benefits of smoking cessation
substantially exceed any risks from the average 5-pound weight
gain or any adverse psychologic effects that may follow quitting.
<HR>

<a name="legal">
<P>
<B>LEGAL ISSUES: </B>
<P>
Indiana law defines &quot;tobacco&quot; as chewing tobacco; cigars,
cigarettes, and snuff that contain tobacco; and pipe tobacco.
<P>
A person less than 18 years of age who purchases tobacco or accepts
tobacco for personal use commits a Class C infraction, for which
the usual sentence is a maximum $500 fine.
<P>
A person who knowingly sells or distributes tobacco to a person
less than 18 years of age also commits a Class C infraction.
<P>
It is illegal to sell tobacco via vending machines in Indiana,
unless the vending machine is located in an area unaccessible
to persons under the age of 18. Restaurants, for example cannot
have cigarette vending machines, except in a bar area that is
restricted from entry by minors. Violating this law is also a
Class C infraction.
<P>
Federal law requires a rotating system of warnings on cigarette
packages and advertising. Brands must rotate warnings every three
months, so four warnings appear in a year. The current warnings
begin with &quot;SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING,&quot; and are followed
with: 1) &quot;Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema,
and May Complicate Pregnancy,&quot; 2) &quot;Smoking by Pregnant
Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth
Weight,&quot; 3) &quot;Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide,&quot;
or 4) &quot;Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks
to Your Health.&quot;
<P>
All smokeless tobacco packages and advertising must display one
of three rotating health warnings, which are: 1) &quot;Warning:
This product may cause mouth cancer,&quot; 2) &quot;Warning: This
product may cause gum disease and tooth loss,&quot; and 3) &quot;Warning:
This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.<HR>

<P>
<B>OTHER ISSUES:</B> 
<P>
Prevention of other illegal drugs use begins with the prevention
of tobacco and other gateway drug use. Gateway drugs are drugs
that serve as almost essential social and psychological precursors
to use of other drugs, such as marijuana, heroin and cocaine,
although the link between the gateway drug and the other drug
is not biochemical.
<P>
Cigarettes are the ultimate gateway drug. In 1987, a research
team at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research
found that among high-school seniors, daily cigarette smokers
were <B>10 times more likely to use cocaine</B> regularly than
were seniors who never had smoked regularly. Students who never
smoked were much less likely to experiment with controlled substances
and very unlikely to use them regularly. A tobacco-free lifestyle
serves as a powerful protective factor against abuse of controlled
substances.
<P>
Studies show that the younger a smoker becomes addicted, the tougher
it is to quit. According to the American Lung Association, 60
percent of smokers begin by age 14, and 90 percent by age 19,
and most of them think they never will get hooked on nicotine.

<HR>

<P>
<B>VERY-LOW ALCOHOL BEVERAGES</B> 
<P>
What looks like a beer, smells like a beer, tastes like a beer,
even foams like a beer, but is <U>not</U> a beer? The answer is:
a <B>&quot;NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER,&quot;</B> a name that brewers have
given to very low-alcohol beverages. These so-called &quot;non-alcoholic&quot;
brews are not free of alcohol. By law, non-alcoholic beverages
may contain no more than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. For products
to be treated as an alcoholic beverage under the law, they must
contain at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.
<P>
By comparison, natural fermentation produces similar low levels
of alcohol in most fruit juices. Typical levels of alcohol in
orange juice range from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent. The alcohol
level in the two best selling &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot;
is 0.28 percent and 0.37 percent. Most true beers in Indiana contain
about 4 percent alcohol, with low-alcohol beers having about 2.5
percent alcohol, and light beers about 3.2 percent alcohol (ranging
from 1.9 percent to 4 percent).
<P>
Although the very-low alcohol beverages do not contain enough
alcohol to cause intoxication when taken in reasonable doses --
it would take about 30 12-ounce servings in one hour to bring
a 150-pound man's blood-alcohol concentration up to about 0.10
percent alcohol by volume -- they have been the center of controversy
since more aggressive marketing efforts began a few years ago.
<P>
These products have been around since prohibition, but only in
the past few years have low- and non-alcoholic beers returned
as a major force on the market. Very-low alcohol brews represent
less than one-half of one percent of the total U.S. beer consumption.
They are, however, one of the fastest growing segments of the
beer industry. The number of users has been rising by 6 to 15
percent per year. Brewers report that annual sales were as low
as 4.5 million cases five years ago, climbed to 10 million cases
in 1990, and are predicted to triple in the next five years.
<P>
The increasing market for very-low alcohol brews could be attributed
to new marketing techniques, better tasting products, stricter
drinking and driving laws, greater health consciousness, or a
scheme to develop children's taste for beer.
<P>
Very-low alcohol brews are made using one of two methods. One
method stops the fermentation process before much alcohol is produced.
The other removes alcohol from regular beers using heat or vacuum
distillation.
<P>
Most of the controversy surrounding &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot;
center around their similarity with true beer. The brews do contain
some, albeit a small, amount of alcohol and the taste of the brews
are much like the real thing. Addiction professionals have expressed
concern that relapse in recovering alcoholics may be triggered
by the taste, smell or appearance of the products. Children also
may acquire a taste for beer if the products are available to
them.
<P>
The consumption of &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot; may cause harmful
physiological effects due to interaction of the small amounts
of alcohol with other drugs or medications. Those who are using
the anti-alcoholism drug Antabuse (disulfiram) should avoid &quot;non-alcoholic
brews&quot; because even trace amounts of alcohol can set off
an adverse reaction.
<P>
Alcohol use during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetus, so the
surgeon general of the United States has recommended that women
who are pregnant or
<P>
considering pregnancy abstain from using any alcoholic beverages.
Non-alcoholic brews should not be consumed because no level of
alcohol consumption is free of risk to the fetus.
<P>
While the physiological effects of these drinks are somewhat negligible
for most, they do pose a psychological danger to recovering alcoholics.
The familiar taste, albeit non-alcoholic, could trigger a response
that would lead to a relapse. A psychiatrist, who is recovering
from alcoholism, said he tried a non-alcoholic brew and, &quot;three-
quarters of the way through, I started feeling dizzy. I don't
know if it was the small amount of alcohol that affected me or
if I was affected psychologically.&quot;
<P>
These products have come under fire from pro-health groups, on
grounds that they may serve as &quot;training beers&quot; for
young people. The brews allow children to legally imitate adult
alcohol consumption.
<P>
&quot;We have serious concerns that these products, either by
design or actuality, may cause serious confusion among the young,
and that they may in fact represent a seductive introductory vehicle
to get the young to begin using a form of beer,&quot; says Hamilton
Beazley, former president of the National Council on Alcoholism
and Drug Dependence. &quot;This is kind of like candy cigarettes.
It's a poor model for kids.&quot;
<P>
Many people view &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot; as a gateway
set up by the beer industry to get young people to acquire the
taste of beer. The beer industry claims the beverages are designed
for people who want beer, but don't want the alcohol - health-conscious
yuppies, for example.
<P>
The very-low alcohol brews also create enforcement problems for
police and school administrators. These brews can serve as decoys
that allow minors to defy laws that prohibit alcohol consumption.
Minors could fill the &quot;non-alcoholic brew&quot; containers
with regular beer, and argue that they are not drinking real beer.
It is virtually impossible to test each individual bottle or can,
or impound as evidence to test for alcohol content. It would be
too time-consuming and too expensive.
<P>
School administrators would be similarly perplexed, and there
are currently few, if any, policies to control use of the non-alcoholic
brews. Schools and colleges may have difficulty preventing possession
or use of &quot;non-alcohol brews&quot; on their premises if they
allow other carbonated sodas, such as Coke or Pepsi. It could
be argued that such regulations were unfair brand discrimination.
<P>
Another concern is that the new &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot;
might be a ploy to get around pending advertising restrictions
on real beer. The NCAA, for example, has restricted the number
of beer commercials that can be shown on college basketball tournament
telecasts. If advertising time for alcohol on television is limited,
or if an outright ban of such promotions would occur, the alcoholic
beverage industry could run ads for these &quot;non-alcohol&quot;
beers. Commercials create a powerful visual stimulus, and that
just-grabbed-from-the-cooler-look might stimulate the desire for
a real beer.
<P>
Because &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot; are not legally considered
to be alcoholic beverages, they are exempt from federal and state
excise taxes. But then why are they priced the same as, or higher
than, regular beer?<HR>

<P><a name="legal">
<B>LEGAL ISSUES: </B>
<P>
Because Indiana law defines an alcoholic beverage as a liquid
or solid that is or contains 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume,
is fit for human consumption and is reasonably likely, or intended,
to be used as a beverage, alcoholic beverage laws do not apply
to &quot;non-alcoholic brews.&quot; This means there are no legal
restrictions on age of purchaser, hours of sale, etc.
<P>
In a February 1990 statutory interpretation, the Indiana Alcoholic
Beverage Commission classified &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot;
as carbonated sodas. IABC determined it does not regulate sale
of carbonated sodas, except in package liquor stores, so it cannot
make rules about vending machine sales, sales to minors, etc.
Indiana law does not allow package liquor store permit holders
to sell cooled soft drinks, so liquor stores cannot sell &quot;non-alcoholic
brews&quot; cold. Other permittees, such as convenience stores,
have no such regulations, and may sell &quot;non-alcoholic brews&quot;
warm or cold. Some retail establishments and chains voluntarily
have decided to restrict sales of these beverages to individuals
over 21.
<P>
Because the products are not alcoholic beverages, proposed restrictions
on advertising of alcoholic beverages would not apply. Because
the brews look, smell and taste like alcoholic beers, enforcing
laws against minor possession or use of beer may be more difficult,
if accused minors claim the beverages in question are non-alcoholic.
But users of non-alcoholic beers may have unnecessary legal problems
if law enforcement officers mistake the non-alcoholic beverages
for alcoholic ones.

<li>The Westside PTA wants to determine the need for after-school programs that provide 
alcohol- and other drug-free supervised activities for "latchkey" children living in the school 
district.  The PTA needs to know the number of children under the age of 14 who live in 
single parent households and in households where both parents work outside the home.
<li> The Hoosier Ridge Neighborhood Association wants to survey residents living in  the 
neighborhood to determine the feasibility of establishing a drug-free zone.  The association 
needs to know the educational level of adult residents in the area bounded by West 7th Street, 
North Walnut Street, the Penn Central Railroad tracks, and North Adams Street, to make sure 
that the promotional materials and survey questions are written at an appropriate readability 
level.
<li>The Big Brothers program wants to expand its after-school programs for 9- to 12-year 
old boys who live in households headed by single mothers. The program needs information 
about the number of such boys living within walking distance of proposed satellite locations, to 
determine which location would be most convenient for the target population.
<li> The Hispanic League wishes to use Spanish-language billboards to reach residents living 
on the south side of the city.  The league would like to know the relative proportion of 
Spanish-speaking residents who live in the neighborhoods surrounding three proposed billboard 
sites, to determine which site would be most effective.
</ul></i>
<p>
As alcohol- and other-drug prevention programs become more sophisticated, they need precise 
data to assist with planning efforts.  Hunches, instinct, and good intentions are not enough.  
Today's prevention planners need detailed information about their target audiences to improve 
their ability to reach those audiences in the most effective and efficient ways.  They need data 
on age, education, income levels, family structure, and living patterns of their audiences.
<p>
When major corporations have questions such as these, they usually seek information from 
market research firms who scan existing demographic data from census reports and survey 
research.  In many cases, all of the needed data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau.  
The research firms simply extract the needed information and present it in a format that the 
corporations can use.
<p>
<b><i>Social marketing</b></i> is a system that utilizes the tools and techniques of 
marketing to sell an idea, concept, or behavior, rather than a product.  Just as the 
manufacturer researches markets for a new product. prevention agencies should research their 
"markets" prior to making decisions or implementing a new program.  The Winter 1992 issue
of <i>Prevention Newsline</i> described how communications research can improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of prevention programs.  This article describes how market 
research about a target audience can assist prevention planners in program development and 
evaluation.
<p>
Marketing experts have learned that product sales can be increased by dividing their market 
into :market segments," and then directing specialized messages to each market segment.  For 
example, a detergent manufacturer may use one advertisement in magazines with a younger 
audience, and another ad for the same product when selling to senior citizens.
<p>
Problems can arise when advertising is inappropriately targeted to certain audiences, such as 
cigarette ads targeted toward children, but prevention professionals can use market 
segmentation for more positive purposes.  Using sophisticated demographic data, prevention 
messages can be directed at the appropriate audience segment.  For example, market research 
can help planners identify which parts of a city have the highest concentrations of children 
living in high-risk environments, so that prevention messages can be more efficiently directed 
to those children.
<p>
Much of the information needed by social marketers and prevention professionals can be found 
in U.S. Census Bureau data obtained from the regular decennial Census of Population and 
Households.  While no individually identifiable information is available, profiles of every 
"census tract" and "census block" allow the user to obtain information about the group 
characteristics of individuals living within those tracts or blocks.
<p>
A "census tract" is a distinct geographic area including about 500 to 1000 homes, with a 
population of several thousand people.  Census tracts often are the equivalent of distinct 
neighborhoods or large subdivisions.  A "census block" is a smaller geographic area including 
50 to 200 homes, and a population of several hundred people.  Within city limits, a census 
block may be the equivalent of several city blocks.  The Census Bureau calculates data on over 
3,200 variables for each census tract or block.
<p>
Since the 1970 census, this type of information has been available from the Census Bureau on 
computer tapes, but due to the need to use powerful mainframe computers, only the largest 
market research firms could provide the data.  The cost of obtaining demographic profiles 
often was prohibitive for most prevention programs.
<p>
Now, for the first time, data from the 1990 Census are available on CD-ROM disks that can be 
read by high-end desktop computers.  The era of "desktop demographics" has arrived.
<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center (IPRC) recently acquired new computer software to 
allow it to help local prevention programs use 1990 Census data for program planning 
purposes.  Using an Intel Pentium-based computer workstation recently purchased by the 
Indiana University Institute for Drug Abuse Prevention (IU-IDAP), the IPRC now can provide 
demographic reports needed by Indiana prevention agencies.
<p>
<b><i>PCensus-USA</i></b> is a user-friendly computer software program that 
allows users to access and sort through census data in a matter of seconds.  
<i>PCensus</i> is a registered trademark of Tetrad Computer Applications, Ltd.
<p>
The IPRC has acquired this software, plus the entire Indiana data sets from the 1990 Census 
(STF-1A and STF-3A files), which allow us to provide detailed demographic information on 
more than 3,200 population and housing variables for each census tract and census block in 
Indiana.  Since these "geographic building blocks" can be structured together to create larger 
areas, this means that demographic profiles can be generated by the IPRC for any pre-defined 
or user-defined geographic area in Indiana.
<p>

<p>
If a patron needs information about an existing, pre-defined geographic area such as a county, 
city, or town, the data are generated almost immediately.  If a patron needs information on a 
particular neighborhood or subdivision, the area can be user-defined through the use of 
detailed census maps.
<p>
If a patron needs information on a particular neighborhood or subdivision, the area can be 
user-defined through use of detailed census maps.  At present, IPRC is using 1/24,000 scale 
maps produced by the U.S. Geologic Survey, but use of computerized census maps (TIGER 
line files) is possible.  Because the Indiana Geologic Survey is located just a few blocks from 
the IPRC at Indiana University-Bloomington, we are able to obtain the paper maps easily for 
any location in Indiana.
<p>
Using the detailed maps, a user may define an area as a circle around a particular point, or a 
multi-sided polygon by defining the boundaries of the area to be searched.  A circle could be 
used, for example, to determine the characteristics of the population living within one or two 
miles of a particular location.  A polygon could be used to define a school attendance district, a 
neighborhood, or a political subdivision such as a precinct or city council district.
<p>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/publications/demomap.gif">

<p>
<h6>As illustrated above, desktop demographic software lets a user define a particular 
neighborhood for demographic analysis, such as this area of Indianapolis.<br></h6>
<p>
Demographic market research is no longer limited to census data.  Recently, the IPRC has 
purchased a detailed "psychodemographic" data system, <b>MicroVision 50</b>, 
developed by the National Decision Systems division of Equifax.  This system provides 
information about lifestyles and values.  In the <i>MicroVision</i> system, 50 "lifestyle 
clusters," with exotic names such as "Lap of Luxury" and "Movers and Shakers" are used to 
categorize clusters of individuals.  Although two clusters may appear similar in census data, 
their lifestyle patterns and values may be quite different.  For example, those young 
professionals in the "White Picket Fence" cluster may be more goal oriented and less 
hedonistic than others of similar age and income in the "Young and Carefree" cluster.  IPRC 
can now import these data into the <i>PCensus</i> data, allowing neighborhood-by-
neighborhood analysis of lifestyles and values.
<p>
In 1994, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center's affiliated research organization, IU-IDAP, 
began a three-year needs assessment project, the <b>Indiana Prevention Needs Assessment 
Studies</b>, which will help provide additional planning information.  This project consists 
of a "family" of five separate needs assessment studies.  Some of the data from these studies 
also will be available by census tract or census block.  By 1997, a whole new data set will be 
available to assist prevention planners in making decisions about how best to serve their target 
audiences.
<p>
IPRC prevention specialists can help local prevention programs obtain relevant demographic 
information needed to improve program planning and evaluation activities.  We can provide 
detailed reports similar to those previously provided only by large market research firms.  
However, due to the need to obtain and consult paper maps, and due to staffing limitations, 
demographic reports are not available on a walk-in basis, but must be scheduled by 
appointment.  Due to limited staffing levels, this service is currently restricted to use by bona-
fide <b>prevention</b> programs located in Indiana.
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Demographic research helps reach populations, but won't let programs target specific 
individuals.</h3><br>
<p>
Although demographic research can provide prevention planners with a wealth of demographic 
information that is useful in prevention program development, there are limitations to its 
usefulness.
<p>
Just as a product marketer could not expect demographic research to identify a group in which 
100 percent of the members would need a particular product, a social marketer cannot expect 
market research to identify a target audience that is 100 percent in need of service.  All market 
research can do is improve the odds.
<p>
Fans of the TV series "LA Law" will remember the peripatetic direct mail mogul, David 
Meyer, talking endlessly about "response rates" to his mailings.  Two percent was "break 
even, 3 percent meant a profit, and a 5 or 6 percent response was a smashing success.  Meyer 
used market research to identify which target audiences were more likely to need or want his 
service,
<p>
Demographic research can help you identify populations that are more likely than the average 
to need your services.  If the rates of drug use are higher in groups that have certain 
demographic characteristics -- i.e. those who live in "high-risk environments" -- then market 
research can help you find groups that have those characteristics.
<p>
Demographic research cannot identify <b>individuals</b> within those groups that are in 
need of your services.
<p>
For example, if children living in single-parent households are more likely to have experienced 
the trauma of growing up with an alcoholic parent, demographic research can identify 
neighborhoods with high frequencies of single-parent families, but can't tell you which of those 
families have alcoholism within.
<p>
Demographic research can improve your odds of locating children in need of your services by 
identifying <b>groups</b> with characteristics similar to those in need.  It cannot 
distinguish single-parent families with an alcoholic parent from those without an alcoholic 
parent, nor can it identify <b>specific</b> families in need of your services.
<p>
<p>

<p>
<h3> Demographics in Action:  How Research Could Be Used in Prevention
</h3>
<p>
Have you ever lost a policy battle, or failed to gain approval for one of your prevention 
initiatives due to a lack of hard information?  Consider the possibilities of how desktop 
demographics can provide the needed information to make you more effective.  Dream, for a 
moment, of the following hypothetical situation...
<p>
Officials at a university campus are alarmed upon learning of an application for a new liquor 
license adjacent to their campus.  The applicant plans to open a bar within walking distance of  
most campus undergraduate residence halls.  Knowing that research shows that the proximity 
of liquor outlets has a major impact upon underage alcohol consumption, the university seeks 
denial of the application based upon the potential adverse impact upon the surrounding 
neighborhood (mostly the campus), which houses many residents under the legal drinking age.
<p>
The applicants argue that they will avoid selling to minors and that there are plenty of potential 
customers over the legal drinking age in the neighborhood.  They also challenge campus 
administrators to document the character of the neighborhood and to describe how it might be 
adversely affected.
<p>
Using desktop demographic software, the university pinpoints the location of the proposed bar 
and establishes a "user-defined" area by drawing concentric circles that are one-half mile, one 
mile, and one and one-half miles from the location.  Then they use 1990 census data to show 
the percentage of 18- to 20-year olds living in each circle.  These data are used to support the 
university's contention that the neighborhood contains a disproportionate number of 18- to 20-
year olds, and that fewer than 20 percent of the neighborhood's residents are of legal drinking 
age.  Without precise data, it would be difficult to document a new liquor license's potential 
for adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
<p>
Desktop demographic software also could be used to compare the density of liquor outlets in 
specific parts of town, to document over-saturation of outlets in a given neighborhood.  
Demographic data also can assist prevention programs in documenting the need for 
governmental action, funding, and programming.

<a name="intro"><h4>SECRETARY'S INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
--Lamar Alexander, Secretary of Education<p>


     As a parent of school-aged children, I share with all
Americans concern about illegal drug and alcohol use and the
threat these substances pose to the welfare of our Nation's  
efforts of the last few years are paying off. The 1990 survey of
high school seniors, for example, showed that these young people
are less tolerant of drug use and more knowledgeable about the
risks of using drugs. For the first time in many years, fewer
than half of them have tried an illicit drug.   Many factors
contribute to these encouraging trends. As President Bush has
reminded us, parents have an especially vital part to play:<p>
     Schools, churches, synagogues, community groups, law
enforcement--all can help us turn the tide on drug and alcohol
abuse. But none can take a parent's place. Drug education must
begin at home and in the neighborhood long before the classroom.
Statement from the White House, February 26, 1990.<p>
     The standards of behavior we establish in our families
provide our children with the strongest inducements to stay off
of drugs. This handbook helps families learn about drugs,
including the drugs most children use first--alcohol and tobacco.
It gives important information on child development at four key
stages of growth and suggests activities to reinforce drug
prevention messages in the home.<p>
     Growing Up Drug Free is based on the best available
information about how children learn and what works to prevent
drug abuse. There is nothing difficult about this information,
and the only qualification needed to use it is a loving concern
for the welfare of our children and families.<p>
     Concern for the welfare of children and families underpins
every one of the national education goals that form the basis of
President Bush's AMERICA 2000 education strategy. One of these
goals is that every school in America will be free of drugs and
violence and will offer a discipline environment conducive to
learning. The AMERICA 2000 strategy recognizes that our schools,
our workplaces, and our communities cannot be places where
education comes first unless and until they are drug free. Our
role as parents is to do our part to help make drug-free schools
and communities a reality by the year 2000. What Parents Can
Do.<p><p><hr>
<p><a name="intro2"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
     Child rearing is one of the most important tasks anyone ever
performs, and the one for which there is the least preparation.
Most of us learn how to be parents through on-the-job training
and by following the example that our parents set.   Today the
widespread use of alcohol and other drugs subjects our children,
families, and communities to pressures unheard of 30 or 40 years
ago. Frankly, many of us need help to deal with this frightening
threat to our children's health and well-being.   Recent surveys
show that we are making progress in our national battle against
some drugs. Casual use is declining, attitudes are changing, and
we know more about what works to prevent drug use by our young
people.<p>
     As parents, we can build on that progress in our own
families by having strong, loving relationships with our
children, by teaching standards of right and wrong, by setting
and enforcing rules for behavior, by knowing the facts about
alcohol and other drugs, and by really listening to our
children.<p><p><hr>
<p>
<a name="values"><h4>TEACHING VALUES</h4></a>
     Every family has expectations of behavior that are
determined by principles and standards. These add up to "values."
Children who decide not to use alcohol or other drugs often make
this decision because they have strong convictions against the
use of these substances-convictions that are based in a value
system. Social, family, and religious values give young people
reasons to say no and help them stick to their decisions.<p>

Here are some ways to help make your family's values clear:<p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate values openly. Talk about why values such as
honesty, self-reliance, and responsibility are important, and how
values help children make good decisions. Teach your child how
each decision builds on previous decisions as one's character is
formed, and how a good decision makes the next decision
easier.
<li> Recognize how your actions affect the development of your
child's values. Simply stated, children copy their parents'
behavior. Children whose parents smoke, for example, are more
likely to become smokers. Evaluate your own use of tobacco,
alcohol, prescription medicines, and even over-the-counter drugs.
Consider how your attitudes and actions may be shaping your
child's choice about whether or not to use alcohol or other
drugs.   This does not mean, however, that if you are in the
habit of having wine with dinner or an occasional beer or
cocktail you must stop. Children can understand and accept that
there are differences between what adults may do legally and what
is appropriate and legal for children. Keep that distinction
sharp, however. Do not let your children be involved in your
drinking by mixing a cocktail for you or bringing you a beer, and
do not allow your child to have sips of your drink.

<li> Look for conflicts between your words and your actions.
Remember that children are quick to sense when parents send
signals by their actions that it's all right to duck unpleasant
duties or to be dishonest. Telling your child to say that you are
not at home because a phone call comes at an inconvenient time
is, in effect, teaching your child that it is all right to be
dishonest.

<li> Make sure that your child understands your family values.
Parents assume, sometimes mistakenly, that children have
"absorbed" values even though they may be rarely or never
discussed. You can test your child's understanding by discussing
some common situations at the dinner table; for example, "What
would you do if the person ahead of you in line at the theater
dropped a dollar bill?"</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p><a name="setting"><h4>SETTING AND ENFORCING RULES AGAINST THE USE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS</h4></a>
     As parents, we are responsible for setting rules for our
children to follow. When it comes to alcohol and other drug use,
strong rules need to be established to protect the well-being of
a child. Setting rules is only half the job, however; we must be
prepared to enforce the penalties when the rules are broken.
<p><ul>

<li> Be specific. Explain the reasons for the rules. Tell your child
what the rules are and what behavior is expected. Discuss the
consequences of breaking the rules: what the punishment will be,
how it will be carried out, how much time will be involved, and
what the punishment is supposed to achieve.
<li> Be consistent. Make it clear to your child that a no-
alcohol/no-drug-use rule remains the same at all times--in your
home, in a friend's home, anywhere the child is.


<li> Be reasonable. Don't add new consequences that have not been
discussed before the rule was broken. Avoid unrealistic threats
such as, "Your father will kill you when he gets home." Instead,
react calmly and carry out the punishment that the child expects
to receive for breaking the rule.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<p>
<a name="getting"><h4>GETTING THE FACTS</h4></a>
     As parents, we need to know about alcohol and other drugs so
that we can provide our children with current and correct
information. If we have a working knowledge of common drugs--know
their effects on the mind and body, and the symptoms of their use
we can discuss these subjects intelligently with our children. In
addition, well informed parents are better able to recognize if a
child has symptoms of alcohol or drug-related problems: At a
minimum, you should:<p><ul>
<li> know the different types of drugs and alcohol most commonly
used and the dangers associated with each;
<li> be able to identify paraphernalia associated with each drug; be
familiar with the street names of drugs; know what drugs look
like;
<li> know the signs of alcohol and other drug use and be alert for
changes in your child's behavior or appearance;

<li> know how to get help promptly if you suspect your child may be
using alcohol and other drugs.</ul>

     For current information on alcohol and other drug use, the
resource section in this guide can help direct parents to
clearinghouses, drug and alcohol prevention organizations, and
parent groups--to name a few.<p><hr><p>

<a name="children"><h4>CHILDREN AND ALCOHOL</h4></a>
     Parents who are clear about not wanting their children to
use illicit drugs may find it harder to be tough about alcohol.
After all, alcohol is legal for adults, many parents drink, and
alcohol is a part of some religious observances. As a result, we
may view alcohol as a less dangerous substance than other drugs.
The facts say otherwise:<p><ul>
<li> 4.6 million teenagers have a drinking problem.<br>

<li> 4 percent of high school seniors drink alcohol every day.<br>

<li> Alcohol-related accidents are the leading cause of death among
young people 15 to 24 years of age.<br>

<li> About half of all youthful deaths in drowning, fires, suicide,
and homicides are alcohol related.<br>

<li> Young people who use alcohol at an early age are more likely to
use alcohol heavily and to have alcohol-related problems; they
are also more likely to abuse other drugs and to get into trouble
with the law.<br>

<li> Young people whose body weight is lower than adults reach a
higher blood alcohol concentration level than adults and show
greater effects for longer periods of time.<p></ul><p>
<hr><p>
<a name="facts"><h4>FACTS ON TOBACCO</h4></a>
     We know that smokers are 10 times as likely as nonsmokers to
develop lung cancer and 3 times as likely to die at early ages
from heart attack. In fact, in 1985, smoking was the leading
cause of early death among adults. Nicotine, the active
ingredient in tobacco, is as addictive as heroin, and fewer than
20 percent of smokers are able to quit the first time they try.
Despite these facts, many children use these products.<p><ul>

<li> 18 percent of high school seniors are daily smokers; 11 percent
smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day. <p>

<li> Young people who use cigarettes are also at great risk for all
   other drug use. <p>

<li> 70 percent of all children try cigarettes, 40 percent of them
   before they have reached high school. <p>

<li> Cigarettes contain more than 4,000 harmful substances, several
   of which cause cancer. <p>

<li> 12 percent of boys and 1 percent of girls have chewed tobacco
or used snuff. Smokeless tobacco is just as addictive and harmful
as tobacco that is smoked. <p></ul>

<a name="talking"><h4>TALKING WITH AND LISTENING TO YOUR CHILD</h4></a>
     Many parents hesitate to discuss alcohol and other drug use
with their child. Some of us believe that our children couldn't
become involved with illegal substances. Others delay because we
don't know what to say or how to say it, or we are afraid of
putting ideas into our children's heads.<p>

     Don't wait until you think your child has a problem. Many
young people in treatment programs say that they had used alcohol
and other drugs for at least two years before their parents knew
about it. Begin early to talk about alcohol and other drugs, and
keep the lines of communication open.<p>

     Don't be afraid to admit that you don't have all the
answers. Let your child know that you are concerned, and that you
can work together to find answers. Some references that may help
are listed later in this text of this guide.<p>

     Here are some basic hints for improving your ability to talk
with your child about alcohol and other drugs:<p>
* Be a good listener. Make sure your child feels comfortable
bringing problems or questions to you. Listen closely to what
your child says. Don't allow anger at what you hear to end the
discussion. If necessary, take a 5 minute break to calm down
before continuing. Take note of what your child is not saying,
too. If the child does not tell you about problems, take the
initiative and ask questions about what is going on at school or
in other activities.<p>

  Be available to discuss even sensitive subjects. Young people
need to know that they can rely on their parents for accurate
information about subjects that are important to them. If your
child wants to discuss something at a time when you can't give it
full attention, explain why you can't talk, set a time to talk
later, and then carry through on it!<p><ul>


<li> Give lots of praise. Emphasize the things your youngster is
doing right instead of always focusing on things that are wrong.
When parents are quicker to praise than to criticize, children
learn to feel good about themselves, and they develop the self-
confidence to trust their own judgment.<p>


<li> Give clear messages. When talking about the use of alcohol and
other drugs, be sure you give your child a clear no-use message,
so that the child will know exactly what is expected. For
example, "In our family we don't allow the use of illegal drugs,
and children are not allowed to drink."<p>


<li> Model good behavior. Children learn by example as well as
teaching. Make sure that your own actions reflect the standards
of honesty, integrity, and fair play that you expect of your
child.<p></ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<a name="communication"><h4>COMMUNICATION TIPS</h4></a>
     Effective communication between parents and children is not
always easy to achieve. Children and adults have different
communication styles and different ways of responding in a
conversation. In addition, timing and atmosphere may determine
how successful communication will be. Parents should make time to
talk with their children in a quiet, unhurried manner. The
following tips are designed to make communication more
successful.<p><ul>


<h4>LISTENING</h4>
<p><ul>
<li> Pay attention.<br>
<li> Don't interrupt.<br>
<li> Don't prepare what you will say while your child is
speaking.<br>
<li> Reserve judgment until your child has finished and has asked
you for a response.<br></ul>
<p><hr>
<p>
<h4>LOOKING</h4><br><p><ul>
<li> Be aware of your child's facial expression and body language.
Is your child nervous or uncomfortable--frowning, drumming
fingers, tapping a foot, looking at the clock? Or does your child
seem relaxed--smiling, looking you in the eyes? Reading these
signs will help parents know how the child is feeling.<br>

<li> During the conversation, acknowledge what your child is saying-
-move your body forward if you are sitting, touch a shoulder if
you are walking, or nod your head and make eye contact.<br></ul>
<p>
<h4>RESPONDING</h4><br><p><ul>
<li> "I am very concerned about...." or "I understand that it is
sometimes difficult ...." are better ways to respond to your
child than beginning sentences with "You should," or "If I were
you," or "When I was your age we didn't...." Speaking for oneself
sounds thoughtful and is less likely to be considered a lecture
or an automatic response.<p>
<li> If your child tells you something you
don't want to hear, don't ignore the statement.<p>

<li> Don't offer advice in response to every statement your child
makes. It is better to listen carefully to what is being said and
try to understand the real feelings behind the words.<p>

<li> Make sure you understand what your child means. Repeat things
to your child for confirmation.<p></ul></ul><p>

     The preceding sections have outlined some general guidelines
for talking with children about alcohol and other drugs. We can
make these messages more effective by taking into account the
knowledge youngsters already have and their readiness to learn
new information at different ages.<p><p>
<hr><p>
<a name="preschoolers"><h4>PRESCHOOLERS</h4></a><p>
     Drug education may seem unnecessary for preschoolers, but
the attitudes and habits learned early can have an important
bearing on the decisions children make later.<p>
     Three- and four-year-olds are not yet ready to learn complex
facts about alcohol and other drugs, but they can learn the
decision-making and problem-solving skills that they will need to
refuse alcohol and other drugs later. Remember that children in
this age group are not able to listen quietly for very long; they
are more interested in doing things for themselves.<p>

     It's tempting for busy parents to do things for young
children because it's quicker and easier. With a little planning,
however, you can use the learn-by-doing approach to teach your
preschooler how to make decisions. Let your child pick from a
range of options that are acceptable to you. When the choice is
made, make sure your child sticks with it.<p>

<center>
              <h4>  Suggested Activities</h4></center>

<ul>
<li> Set aside regular times when you can give your child your full
attention. Playing together, reading a book, and taking a walk
are special times that help to build strong bonds of trust and
affection between you and your child.<p>


<li> Point out to your child poisonous and harmful substances that
can be found in your home. Household products such as bleach,
lye, and furniture polish all have warning labels that you can
read to your child. Keep all household products that could harm a
small child away from the place you store foods and out of your
child's reach.<p>


<li> Explain how medicine can be harmful if used incorrectly. Teach
your child not to take anything from a medicine bottle unless you
give it to the child yourself or specify someone else who can
give it, such as a babysitter or grandparent.<p>


<li> Explain why children need good food and should put only good
things into their bodies. Have your child name several good foods
that he or she eats regularly, and explain how those foods will
make your child strong and healthy.<p>


<li> Provide guidelines that teach your child what kind of behavior
you expect. Teach your child the basic rules of how to get along
with other children: Play fair. Share toys. Tell the truth. Treat
others the way you want them to treat you.<p>


<li> Encourage your child to follow instructions. For example,
invite your child to help you cook; following a recipe--measuring
ingredients, cracking eggs, kneading dough--can help children
have fun while learning about step-by-step procedures. Playing
simple board games with your child can give practice in following
instructions and rules.<p>


<li> Take advantage of opportunities to use play as a way to help
your child handle frustrating situations and solve simple
problems. A tower of blocks that continuously collapses can drive
a child to tears. You can offer a few suggestions to keep the
tower up, but at the same time you should ask your child what he
or she thinks is the best way to do it. Turning a bad situation
into a success reinforces a child's self-confidence.<p>


<li> To help your child learn decision making in a practical way,
lay out some clothing from which the child can select what he or
she wishes to wear. Don't worry if the choices don't quite match.
Let your child know that you think he or she is able to make good
decisions.<p></ul><p><hr>
<p>
<a name="kindergarten"><h4>KINDERGARTEN-GRADE 3</h4></a><p>

     Five- to nine-year-olds usually feel good about themselves.
They like growing up, and they generally like school and all the
new opportunities it provides. They still think and learn
primarily by experience, and they don't have a good understanding
of things that will happen in the future. Fact and fantasy mingle
easily; the world is seen as the child wishes it to be, and not
as it actually is. Children of this age need rules to guide their
behavior and information to make good choices and decisions.<p>

     Discussions about alcohol and other drugs must be in the
here and now, and related to people and events the child knows
about. Most children are very interested in how their bodies
work, so discussions should focus on maintaining good health and
avoiding things that might harm the body.<p>

     Adults are very important both as teachers and as role
models. Children are generally trusting, and they believe that
the decisions adults make for them are right. Helping your child
know whom to trust is important. They need to understand that
just because someone tells them to do something, it is not always
right to do it.   By the end of the third grade, your child
should understand:<p><ul>

<li> what an illicit drug is, why it is illegal, what it looks like,
and what harm it can do:<p>

<li> how foods, poisons, medicines, and illicit drugs differ;<p>

<li> how medicines may help during illness, when prescribed by a
doctor and administered by a responsible adult, but also how
medicines are drugs that can be harmful if misused:<p>

<li> why it is important to avoid unknown and possibly dangerous
objects, containers, and substances;<p>

<li> which adults, both at school and outside, you want your child
to rely on for answers to questions or help in an emergency;<p>

<li> which foods are nutritious and why exercise is important;<p>

<li> what the school and home rules are about alcohol and other drug
use; and<p>

<li> how using alcohol and other drugs is illegal for all
children.<p></ul>

<h4>  Suggested Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li> Children in this age group need to understand the family's
rules. You can explain the need for rules by talking about
traffic safety rules and school rules with which your child is
already familiar.<p>


<li> Emphasize the importance of good health by talking about things
people do to stay healthy, such as brushing teeth after each
meal, washing hands, eating good foods, getting plenty of rest
and sleep. You can use this discussion to contrast the harmful
things that people do, such as taking drugs, smoking, or drinking
to excess.<p>


<li> Discuss how TV advertisers try to persuade children to buy
their products, including high sugar/additives-loaded cereals,
candy bars, and toys named after characters in cartoon shows that
children find appealing.<p>


<li> Discuss illnesses with which your child is familiar and for
which prescription drugs are often necessary. Many children have
had strep throat, ear infections, flu, and colds. Discussing such
illnesses can help your child understand the difference between
medicine and illicit drugs.<p>


<li> Practice ways to say no with your child. Describe situations
that may make your child feel uncomfortable: being invited to
ride a bike where you do not allow your child to go, for example,
or being offered medicine or other unfamiliar substances. Give
your child some responses to use in these situations.<p>


<li> Develop a "helpers" file of people your child can rely on. Put
together a phone list of relatives, family friends, neighbors,
teachers, religious leaders, and the police and fire departments.
Illustrate the list with photos. Talk with your child about the
kind of help each person on the list could provide in case of
various unexpected situations, such as being approached by
strangers or losing a house key.</ul><p>

<a name="grades4"><h4>GRADES 4-6</h4></a>
     This is a period of slowed physical growth when typically a
lot of energy goes into learning. Children 10 to 12 years old
love to learn facts, especially strange ones, and they want to
know how things work and what sources of information are
available to them.   Friends--a single best friend or a group of
friends--become very important. What children this age are
interested in or will be committed to often is determined by what
the group thinks. Children's self-image is determined in part by
the extent to which they are accepted by peers, especially
popular peers. As a result, a lot of "followers" are unable to
make independent decisions and choices.<p>

     This age is perhaps the most important time for parents to
focus on increased efforts at drug prevention. These late
elementary school years are crucial to decisions about the use of
alcohol and other drugs. The greatest risk for starting to smoke
comes in the sixth and seventh grades. Research shows that the
earlier youngsters begin to use alcohol and other drugs, the more
likely they are to have real trouble.<p>

     Your child will need a clear no-use message, factual
information, and strong motivation to resist pressures to try
alcohol and other drugs and to reinforce the determination to
remain drug free. Appropriate new information could include:<p>
<ul>

<li> ways to identify specific drugs, including alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, inhalants, and cocaine in their various forms;<br>

<li> the long- and short-term effects and consequences of use;<br>

<li> the effects of drugs on different parts of the body, and the
reasons why drugs are especially dangerous for growing bodies;
and<br>

<li> the consequences of alcohol and other illegal drug use to the
family, society, and the user.<br><p>
</ul><center>
                <h4>Suggested Activities</h4></center>
<ul>
<li>  Create special times when you are available to talk to your
child. Try to give your child undivided attention. A walk
together, dinner in a quiet place, or a visit to the ice cream
parlor after a movie are some ways to make talking together a
little easier.<p>

<li>  Encourage your child to participate in wholesome activities
that will allow the child to form new friendships and have fun.
Sports, Scouts, religious-sponsored youth programs, and
community-sponsored youth organizations are excellent ways for
children to meet others of their own age.<p>

<li>  Teach your child to be aware of how drugs and alcohol are
promoted. Discuss how children are bombarded with messages--from
TV, song lyrics, billboards, and advertisements--that using
alcohol and other drugs is very glamorous. Clearly separate the
myths from the realities of alcohol and other drug use.<p>

<li>  Continue to practice ways to say no with your child,
emphasizing ways to refuse alcohol and other drugs. It is not
uncommon for sixth graders to be offered beer and cigarettes and
to know other children who smoke and drink alcohol.<p>

<li>  Encourage your child to join a local anti-drug club or peer
assistance group that encourages drug-free activities.<p>

<li>  Ask your child to scan the morning newspaper and to circle any
article that has to do with alcohol and other drug use. No doubt
there will be articles about drug-related murders, strife in
other countries due to drug trafficking, and alcohol-related auto
accidents. Talk with your child about the tremendous loss of
lives and resources because of the use of alcohol and other
drugs.<p>

<li>  Make friends with the parents of your child's friends so that
you can reinforce one another's efforts in teaching good personal
and social habits. A neighborhood social gathering, sporting
event, or school assembly are good places to meet.<p> 

<li> Join with
other parents in providing supervised activities for young people
to limit "free time," which often leads to experimentation with
alcohol and other drugs.</ul><p>
</ul>
<p><hr>
<p>
<a name="grades7"><h4>GRADES 7-9</h4></a>
     During the early teens "fitting in" with friends is a
controlling influence. In some ways, the onset of puberty is like
a "rebirth." Children want and need to let go of the past and to
find their own unique identity. This often means letting go of
old friendships and ties with teachers and other adults, as well
as old ways of doing things. The decision-making and problem-
solving methods that they learned as young children are still
helpful, but young teens will be making new decisions based on
new information and new goals.<p>
     Young people this age can begin to deal with abstractions
and the future. They understand that their actions have
consequences, and they know how their behavior affects others.
They sometimes have a shaky self-image: they are not sure whether
they are growing and changing adequately, they are often in
conflict with adults, they are not sure where they are headed,
and they tend to see themselves as not "okay." Strong emotional
support and a good model of adult behavior are particularly
important now.<p>
     Young people who use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs
typically begin before leaving the ninth grade. Be sure that
family discussions about drugs emphasize the immediate,
unpleasant effects of alcohol and other drug use. Telling junior
high school students who are smoking that they will get lung
cancer or heart disease in several decades is less likely to make
an impression than talking about bad breath, stained teeth and
fingers, and burned clothing.<p>
  Many young people use drugs because their friends use drugs. A
large portion of your prevention efforts during these years
should be spent reinforcing your child's motivation to avoid
alcohol and other drugs. Here are some important steps:<p><ul>

<li>  Counteract peer influence with parent influence. Reinforce your
no-alcohol/no-drug-use rules and expectations so that your child
clearly understands that drinking and using drugs are
unacceptable and illegal. Children may argue that "everyone is
doing it" and not experiencing any harmful effects. Inform your
child that alcohol and other drug use is illegal for children and
that "everyone is not doing it." Emphasize how unpredictable the
effects of alcohol and other drugs can be, so that although many
drug users may appear to function properly, drug use is extremely
risky, and all it takes is one bad experience to change a
life.<p>
<li>  Get to know your child's friends and their parents. Meet your
child's friends. Invite them to your home frequently. Share your
expectations about behavior with other parents. Work together to
develop a set of rules about curfews, unchaperoned parties, and
other social activities.<br>

<li>  Monitor your child's whereabouts. If your child is at "a
friend's house," be sure that you know the friend and the
parents. If your child is at the movies, be sure you know what
film is playing and at which theater. Last-minute changes in
plans, such as visiting a different friend or going to a
different movie, should not be permitted unless the child checks
with Mom, Dad, or another designated adult.   <p>
</ul>

     By the end of ninth grade your child should know:<br><p><ul>

<li> the characteristics and chemical nature of specific drugs and
drug interactions;<br>

<li> the physiology of drug effects on the circulatory, respiratory,
nervous, and reproductive systems;<br>

<li> the stages of chemical dependency and their unpredictability
from person to person;<br>

<li> the ways that drug use affects activities requiring motor
coordination, such as driving a car or participating in sports;
and<br>

<li> family history, particularly if alcoholism or other drug
addiction has been a problem.<p></ul>
<p><center>
                <h4>Suggested Activities</h4> </center>
<ul>
<li>  Continue to practice ways to say no with your child. Teach your
child to recognize problem situations, such as being at a house
where no adults are present and young people are smoking or
drinking beer. Make up situations in which your child may be
asked to try alcohol and other drugs and let the child practice
saying no using the steps outlined. Try many variations until you
are confident that your child knows how to say no.<br>

<li>  Children this age are very concerned about how others see them.
You can help your child develop a positive self-image by making
sure that the child looks good and feels healthy. In addition to
providing well-balanced meals, keep your refrigerator and pantry
stocked with appealing alternatives to junk food.<br>

<li>  Continue to spend private time with your child to discuss what
your child feels is important in his or her life right now. Your
child's fears about emerging sexuality, appearing different from
friends, and going on to high school are real problems and
deserve your concern and attention.<br>

<li>  Periodically review and update, with your child's
participation, your house rules and your child's responsibilities
regarding chores, homework, time limit on TV watching, and the
curfew on school and weekend nights. Discuss these questions with
your child: Are the rules fair and the consequences appropriate?
Is it time to switch to some new chores? Should there be fewer or
different chores because of added homework assignments or after-
school activities? Should the curfew be adjusted?<br>

<li>  Talk with your child about friendship. Make the point that true
friends do not ask each other to do things they know are wrong
and risk harm to themselves, their friends, or their
families.<br>

<li>  Plan supervised parties or other activities for your child in
your home which reflect a no alcohol/no-drug-use rule. For
example, have your child invite friends to share a pizza and
watch TV.</ul><p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="grades10"><h4>GRADES 10-12</h4></a>
     High school students are future-oriented and can engage in
abstract thinking. They have an increasingly realistic
understanding of adults. Young people therefore want adults to
discuss their concerns and the ways they solve problems and make
decisions. You may have a tremendous new opportunity to help your
children at this age. At the same time, the teenagers continue to
be group-orientated, and belonging to the group motivates much of
their behavior and actions. During these years, young people
often develop a broader outlook and become more interested in the
welfare of others.<p>
     By the end of high school, your child should understand:<p><ul>
<li> both the immediate and long-term physical effects of specific
drugs;<br>

<li> the possibly fatal effects of combining drugs;<br>

<li> the relationship of drug use to other diseases and
disabilities;<br>

<li> the effects of alcohol and other drugs on the fetus during
pregnancy;<br>

<li> the fact that drug use is not a victimless crime;<br>

<li> the effects and possible consequences of operating equipment
while using alcohol and other drugs;<br>

<li> the impact that drug use has on society; and<br>

<li> the extent of community intervention resources.<p></ul>
<p>

     You may want to focus on the potential long-term effects of
alcohol and other drugs during these years: drugs can ruin your
teen's chances of getting into college, being accepted by the
military, or being hired for certain jobs. Your teen may also be
impressed by the importance of being seen as a good role model
for a younger brother or sister.<p>
     Although young people long for independence it is
particularly important to keep them involved in the family and
family activities. They should join the rest of the family for
dinner regularly, be part of family vacations, and remain part of
family routines.<p>
<center>
                <h4>Suggested Activities</h4> <p></center>
<ul>
<li>  Continue to talk with your teenager about alcohol and other
drug use. Chances are your teen has friends who use alcohol and
other drugs or knows people who do. Talk about how alcohol and
other drug use threatens lives and may limit opportunities for
the future.<p>

<li>  Plan strategies to limit your teen's unsupervised hours at
home, while you are at work. Researchers have found that
lunchtime and 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. are periods teenagers are likely
to experiment with alcohol and other drugs.<p>

<li>  Encourage your teenager to work on behalf of a drug prevention
program by being trained as a volunteer to answer hot-line calls
or as a peer counselor.<p>

<li>  Talk with your teenager about joining a sports club, drama
club, arts and crafts center, or dance studio or about
volunteering to work for a church group or community
organization. The busier your teenager is, the less likely he or
she is to be bored and to seek an outlet in alcohol or other
drugs. Volunteer with your teenager, if you have time.<p>

<li>  Plan alcohol- and drug-free activities with other families
during school vacations and major holidays, which can be high-
risk idle times for teens.<p>

<li>  Make sure your teen has access to up-to-date information on
alcohol and other drugs and their effects. Make an effort to be
informed about any new drugs that are popular, and know their
effects. (For suggested reading, see the resources section at the
end of this booklet.)<p>

<li>  Cooperate with other parents to make sure that the parties and
social events your teenager attends are alcohol- and drug-free.
Some families choose to draw up a contract holding adults
responsible for parties given in their homes; the contract
specifies that all parties will be supervised and that there is
to be no use of alcohol or other drugs. (See "Safe Homes" in the
resource section.)<p>

<li>  Help plan community-sponsored drug-free activities such as
alcohol- and drug-free dances and other recreational activities
such as "midnight basketball."<p>

<li>  Talk with your teenager about the future. Discuss your
expectations and your teenager's ambitions. Collect college or
vocational catalogs for your teenager, and discuss different
educational and career options. Plan a family outing to local
colleges and universities.</ul><p>

     Young people use drugs for many reasons that have to do with
how they feel about themselves, how they get along with others,
and how they live. No one factor determines who will use drugs
and who will not, but here are some predictors:<ul>

<li>  low grades or poor school performance, <br>
<li> aggressive, rebellious behavior;<br>
<li> excessive influence by peers;<br>
<li> lack of parental support and guidance; and<br>
<li> behavior problems at an early age.</ul><p>

     Being alert to the signs of alcohol and other drug use
requires a keen eye. It is sometimes hard to know the difference
between normal teenage behavior and behavior caused by drugs.
Changes that are extreme or that last for more than a few days
may signal drug use.   Consider the following questions:
<p>
<ul>

<li>  Does your child seem withdrawn, depressed, tired, and careless
about personal grooming?<br>
<li>  Has your child become hostile and uncooperative?<br>
<li>  Have your child's relationships with other family members
deteriorated?<br>
<li>  Has your child dropped his old friends?<br>
<li>  Is your child no longer doing well in school-- grades slipping,
attendance irregular?<br>
<li>  Has your child lost interest in hobbies, sports, and other
favorite activities?<br>
<li>  Have your child's eating or sleeping patterns changed?
<p>
</ul>


     Positive answers to any of these questions can indicate
alcohol or other drug use. However, these signs may also apply to
a child who is not using drugs but who may be having other
problems at school or in the family. If you are in doubt, get
help. Have your family doctor or local clinic examine your child
to rule out illness or other physical problems.<p>

     Watch for signs of drugs and drug paraphernalia as well.
Possession of common items such as pipes, rolling papers, small
medicine bottles, eye drops, or butane lighters may signal that
your child is using drugs.<p>
     Even when the signs are clearer, usually after the child has
been using drugs for a time, parents sometimes do not want to
admit that their child could have a problem. Anger, resentment,
guilt, and a sense of failure as parents are common reactions.<p>
     If your child is using drugs, it is important to avoid
blaming yourself for the problem and to get whatever help is
needed to stop it. The earlier a drug problem is detected and
faced, the more likely it is that your child can be helped.<p>
     First, do not confront a child who is under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, but wait until the child is sober. Then
discuss your suspicions with your child calmly and objectively. 
Bring in other members of the family to help, if necessary.<p>
     Second, impose whatever discipline your family has decided
on for violating the rules and stick to it. Don't relent because
the youngster promises never to do it again.<p>
     Many young people lie about their alcohol and drug use. If
you think your child is not being truthful and the evidence is
pretty strong, you may wish to have your child evaluated by a
health professional experienced in diagnosing adolescents with
alcohol- and drug-related problems.<p>
     If your child has developed a pattern of drug use or has
engaged in heavy use, you will probably need help to intervene.
If you do not know about drug treatment programs in your area,
call your doctor, local hospital, or county mental health society
for a referral. Your school district should have a substance
abuse coordinator or a counselor who can refer you to treatment
programs, too. Parents whose children have been through treatment
programs can also provide information.<p>
     The most promising drug prevention programs are those in
which parents, students, schools, and communities join together
to send a firm, clear message that the use of alcohol and other
drugs will not be tolerated.<p><hr>
<p>
<a name="school"><h4>SCHOOL-PARENT COOPERATION</h4></a>
     The development of strong policies that spell out rules
governing use, possession, and sale of alcohol and other drugs is
a key part of any school-based prevention program. Learn what
your school's policies are and actively support them. If your
school has no policy, work with teachers, administrators, and
community members to develop one. Good school policies typically
specify what constitutes an alcohol or other drug offense, spell
out the consequences for violating the policy, describe
procedures for handling violations, and build community support
for the policy.<p>
     Visit your child's school and learn how drug education is
being taught. Are the faculty members trained to teach about
alcohol and other drug use? Is drug education a regular part of
the curriculum or limited to a special week? Is it taught through
the health class, or do all teachers incorporate drug education
into their subject area? Do children in every grade receive drug
education, or is it limited to selected grades? Is there a
component for parents?<p>
     If your school has an active program to prevent drug use,
ask to see the materials that are being used. Do they contain a
clear message that alcohol and other drug use is wrong and
harmful? Is the information accurate and up-to-date? Does the
school have referral sources for students who need special
help?<p>
     Let other parents know about the school's policies through
meetings of the parent-teacher organization. At least one meeting
each year should be devoted to issues of alcohol and other drug
use. Knowledgeable local physicians and pharmacists can be
invited to discuss how drugs affect the growth and development of
children, police officers can outline the scope and severity of
the drug problem in your community, and substance abuse
counselors can discuss symptoms of alcohol and other drug use and
treatment options.<p><hr>
<p>
<a name="parent"><h4>PARENT-COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES</h4></a>
     Help your child to grow up alcohol and drug free by
supporting community efforts to give young people healthy
alternatives. Alcohol- and drug-free proms and other school-based
celebrations are growing in popularity around the country. You
can help to organize such events, solicit contributions, and
serve as a chaperon.<p>
     Local businesses are also an excellent source of support for
alternative activities such as athletic teams and part-time jobs.
Shops and restaurants in one community in Texas, for example, now
offer discounts to young people who test negative for drugs in a
voluntary urinalysis.<p>
<hr><p>
<a name="support"><h4>PARENT SUPPORT GROUPS</h4></a>
     Other parents can be valuable allies in your effort to keep
your child drug free. Get to know the parents of your child's
friends. Share expectations about behavior and develop a set of
mutually agreed upon rules about such things as curfews,
unchaperoned parties, and places that are off-limits. Helping
youngsters stay out of trouble is easier when rules of conduct
are clearly known and widely shared.<p>
     Build a network of other adults with whom you can talk. Join
a parent organization in your community, or talk informally with
your friends about common concerns in rearing children. Sharing
experiences can provide insights that help you deal with your
child's behavior. It also helps to know that other parents have
faced similar situations.<p>
     Despite the grim stories that fill our newspapers and
dominate the evening news, most young people do not use illicit
drugs, they do not approve of drug use by their friends, and they
share their parents' concern about the dangers posed by drugs.
Successful prevention efforts, whether in a family, school, or
community setting, have many elements in common: a concern for
the welfare and well being of young people, dedicated adults who
are willing to devote their time and energy, and an unwavering
commitment to being drug free.<p>
     That commitment led a small group of parents in Bowling
Green, Kentucky, to form Bowling Green Parents for Drug-Free
Youth. The organization has worked closely with the local schools
and community to provide training and education for all members
of the community, and it has raised more than $35,000 to help
finance its efforts. Questionnaires administered to students in
grades 7-12 for 6 consecutive years have shown a steady decline
in the use of alcohol and other drugs.<p>
     Gail Amato, president of the Bowling Green Parents for Drug-
Free Youth, speaks persuasively about why parents must be
involved in helping to prevent alcohol and other drug use:
     People often ask me why I think parents are the answer, and
I think it's because we have the most to lose. Schools can help,
churches can help, law enforcement can help, but no one can
replace the family. Being involved with drug and alcohol
prevention lets our children know that we care. It strengthens
the family and helps us to be the kind of parents our children
need us to be.<p>
     A similar commitment leads parents of students in Commodore
Stockton Skills School in Stockton, California, to donate more
than 400 volunteer hours each month helping in the classrooms.
Last year a family picnic held during Red Ribbon Week, a national
drug awareness week, drew 500 participants for a day of games and
activities focused on prevention of drug use.<p>
     In addition to helping in the classroom, Stockton parents
work to maintain discipline, to reinforce students' respect for
other people, and to foster personal responsibility at home.
     As a result, behavioral problems in the school are
infrequent, attendance is high, and area police report juvenile
drug arrests from every school in the city except Commodore
Stockton.<p>
     Successful efforts to rid a neighborhood of drugs are often
joint efforts. Two years ago in New Haven, Connecticut, the
residents of six housing projects joined forces to solve a
neighborhood problem--drugs. The residents were afraid for the
safety of their children and sick of the murders and other
nightly violence related to drug deals.<p>
     Representing more than 1,400 families from the six projects,
the group drafted an action plan to rid the neighborhood of
drugs. The residents asked the local police to conduct "sting"
operations periodically. Members of the New Haven news media have
been invited to the project, where residents speak openly about
the problems they encounter. The residents have invited local
community groups and the Greater New Haven Labor Council to join
in the fight. In addition, the mayor has become directly involved
in their struggle.<p>
     One member, speaking on behalf of the residents, stated its
main objective: "We are banding together to stop this madness so
that we can have a peaceful and livable neighborhood and
community." Today, drug sales have decreased, and members of the
community feel safer and more hopeful about the future.<p>
<hr><p>
<a name="alcohol"><h4>ALCOHOL</h4></a>
     Alcohol consumption causes a number of changes in behavior.
Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination
required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol
can increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts,
including spouse and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of
alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions,
severely altering a person's ability to learn and remember
information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and
death.<p>
     Continued use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden
cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal
symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and
convulsions. Long-term effects of consuming large quantities of
alcohol, especially when combined with poor nutrition, can lead
to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the
liver. In addition, mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy
may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome. These
infants may suffer from mental retardation and other irreversible
physical abnormalities. In addition, research indicates that
children of alcoholic parents are at greater risk than other
children of becoming alcoholics.<p>
<hr><p>
<a name="tobacco"><h4>TOBACCO</h4></a>
     The smoking of tobacco products is the chief avoidable cause
of death in our society. Smokers are more likely than nonsmokers
to contract heart disease some 170,000 die each year from
smoking-related coronary heart disease. Lung, larynx, esophageal,
bladder, pancreatic, and kidney cancers also strike smokers at
increased rates. Some 30 percent of cancer deaths (130,000 per
year) are linked to smoking. Chronic, obstructive lung diseases
such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are 10 times more likely
to occur among smokers than among nonsmokers.<p>
     Smoking during pregnancy also poses serious risks.
Spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birth weights, and fetal
and infant deaths are all more likely to occur when the pregnant
woman is a smoker.<p>
     Cigarette smoke contains some 4,000 chemicals, several of
which are known carcinogens. Perhaps the most dangerous substance
in tobacco smoke is nicotine. Nicotine is the substance that
reinforces and strengthens the desire to smoke. Because nicotine
is highly addictive, addicts find it very difficult to stop
smoking. Of 1,000 typical smokers, fewer than 20 percent succeed
in stopping on the first try.<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="cannabis"><h4>CANNABIS</h4></a>
     All forms of cannabis have negative physical and mental
effects. Several regularly observed physical effects of cannabis
are a substantial increase in the heart rate, bloodshot eyes, a
dry mouth and throat, and increased appetite.<p>
     Use of cannabis may impair or reduce short-term memory and
comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to perform
tasks requiring concentration and coordination, such as driving a
car. Motivation and cognition may be altered, making the
acquisition of new information difficult. Marijuana can also
produce paranoia and psychosis.<p>
     Because users often inhale the unfiltered smoke deeply and
then hold it in their lungs as long as possible, marijuana is
damaging to the lungs and pulmonary system. Marijuana smoke
contains more cancer-causing agents than tobacco smoke. Long-term
users of cannabis may develop psychological dependence and
require more of the drug to get the same effect. The drug can
become the center of their lives.<p><pre>

<a name="inhalants"><h4>INHALANTS</h4></a>
     The immediate negative effects of inhalants include nausea,
sneezing, coughing, nosebleeds, fatigue, lack of coordination,
and loss of appetite. Solvents and aerosol sprays also decrease
the heart and respiratory rates and impair judgment. Amyl and
butyl nitrite cause rapid pulse, headaches, and involuntary
passing of urine and feces. Long-term use may result in hepatitis
or brain damage.<p>
     Deeply inhaling the vapors, or using large amounts over a
short time, may result in disorientation, violent behavior,
unconsciousness, or death. High concentrations of inhalants can
cause suffocation by displacing the oxygen in the lungs or by
depressing the central nervous system to the point that breathing
stops.<p>
     Long-term use can cause weight loss, fatigue, electrolyte
imbalance, and muscle fatigue. Repeated sniffing of concentrated
vapors over time can permanently damage the nervous system.<p>

<a name="cocaine"><h4>COCAINE</h4></a>
     Cocaine stimulates the central nervous system. Its immediate
effects include dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure, heart
rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Occasional use can
cause a stuffy or runny nose, while chronic use can ulcerate the
mucous membrane of the nose. Injecting cocaine with contaminated
equipment can cause AIDS, hepatitis, and other diseases.
Preparation of freebase, which involves the use of volatile
solvents, can result in death or injury from fire or
explosion.<p>
     Crack or freebase rock is extremely addictive, and its
effects are felt within 10 seconds. The physical effects include
dilated pupils, increased pulse rate, elevated blood pressure,
insomnia, loss of appetite, tactile hallucinations, paranoia, and
seizure. The use of cocaine can cause death by cardiac arrest or
respiratory failure.<p> <pre>

<a name="other"><h4>OTHER STIMULANTS</h4></a>
     Stimulants can cause increased heart and respiratory rates,
elevated blood pressure, dilated pupils, and decreased appetite.
In addition, users may experience sweating, headache, blurred
vision, dizziness, sleeplessness, and anxiety. Extremely high
doses can cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat, tremors, loss of
coordination, and even physical collapse. An amphetamine
injection creates a sudden increase in blood pressure that can
result in stroke, very high fever, or heart failure.<p>
     In addition to the physical effects, users report feeling
restless, anxious, and moody. Higher doses intensify the effects.
Persons who use large amounts of amphetamines over a long period
of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis that includes
hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. These symptoms usually
disappear when drug use ceases.<p>    <pre>

<a name="depressants"><h4>DEPRESSANTS</h4></a>
     The effects of depressants are in many ways similar to the
effects of alcohol. Small amounts can produce calmness and
relaxed muscles, but larger doses can cause slurred speech,
staggering gait, and altered perception. Very large doses can
cause respiratory depression, coma, and death. The combination of
depressants and alcohol can multiply the effects of the drugs,
increasing the risks.<p>
     Regular use of depressants over time can result in physical
and psychological addiction. People who suddenly stop taking
large doses can experience withdrawal symptoms, including
anxiety, insomnia, tremors, delirium, convulsions, and death.
Babies born to mothers who abuse depressants may also be
physically dependent on the drugs and show withdrawal symptoms
shortly after they are born. Birth defects and behavioral
problems also may result.<p>

<a name="hallucinogens"><h4>HALLUCINOGENS</h4></a>
     Phencyclidine (PCP) interrupts the functions of the
neocortex, the section of the brain that controls the intellect
and keeps instincts in check. Because the drug blocks pain
receptors, violent PCP episodes may result in self-inflicted
injuries. The effects of PCP vary, but users frequently report a
sense of distance and estrangement. Time and body movement are
slowed down. Muscular coordination worsens and senses are dulled.
Speech is blocked and incoherent. In later stages of chronic use,
users often exhibit paranoid and violent behavior and experience
hallucinations. Large doses may produce convulsions and coma, as
well as heart and lung failure.<p>
     Lysergic acid (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin cause
illusions and hallucinations. The physical effects may include
dilated pupils, elevated body temperature, increased heart rate
and blood pressure, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and tremors.
The user may experience panic, confusion, suspicion, anxiety, and
loss of control. Delayed effects, or flashbacks, can occur even
when use has ceased.<p>

<a name="narcotics"><h4>NARCOTICS</h4></a>
     Narcotics initially produce a feeling of euphoria that often
is followed by drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. Users also may
experience constricted pupils, watery eyes, and itching. An
overdose may produce slow and shallow breathing, clammy skin,
convulsions, coma, and possible death.<p>
     Tolerance to narcotics develops rapidly and dependence is
likely. The use of contaminated syringes may result in disease
such as AIDS, endocarditis, and hepatitis. Addiction in pregnant
women can lead to premature, stillborn, or addicted infants who
experience severe withdrawal symptoms.<p>

<a name="designer"><h4>DESIGNER DRUGS</h4></a>
     Illegal drugs are defined in the terms of their chemical
formulas. To circumvent these legal restriction underground
chemists modify the molecular structure of certain illegal drugs
to produce analogs known as designer drugs. These drugs can be
several hundred times stronger than the drugs they are designed
to imitate.<p>
     The narcotic analogs can cause symptoms such as those seen
in Parkinson's disease: uncontrollable tremors, drooling,
impaired speech, paralysis, and irreversible brain damage.
Analogs of amphetamines and methamphetamines cause nausea,
blurred vision, chills or sweating, and faintness. Psych logical
effects include anxiety, depression, and paranoia. As little as
one dose can cause brain damage The analogs of phencyclidine
cause illusions, hallucinations, and impaired perception.<p>

<a name="anabolic"><h4>ANABOLIC STEROIDS</h4></a>
     Anabolic steroids are a group of powerful compounds closely
related to the male sex hormone testosterone. Developed in the
1930's, steroids are seldom prescribed by physicians today.
Current legitimate medical uses are limited to certain kinds of
anemia, severe burns, and some types of breast cancer.<p>
     Taken in combination with a program of muscle-building
exercise and diet, steroids may contribute to increases in body
weight and muscular strength. Steroid users subject themselves to
more than 70 side effects ranging in severity from liver cancer
to acne and including psychological as well as physical
reactions. The liver and cardiovascular and reproductive systems
are most seriously affected by steroid use. In males, use can
cause withered testicles, sterility, and impotence. In females,
irreversible masculine traits can develop along with breast
reduction and sterility. Psychological effects in both sexes
include very aggressive behavior known as "roid rage" and
depression. While some side effects appear quickly, others, such
as heart attacks and strokes, may not show up for years.<p>
     Signs of steroid use include quick weight and muscle gains
(when used in a weight training program); aggressiveness and
combativeness; jaundice; purple or red spots on the body;
swelling of feet and lower legs; trembling; unexplained darkening
of the skin; and persistent unpleasant breath odor.<p>

<TITLE>IPRC - Version of Prevention Primer: Prevention</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>
Re-posted by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center at Indiana University<br>
<h3><i>Prevention Primer:</i></h3>
<H1>Prevention</H1><P>

While there is no single definition of prevention there is general
agreement among prevention practitioners on the overall goal of prevention.
It is to foster a climate in which:<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Alcohol use is acceptable only for those of legal age and only
when the risk of adverse consequences is minimal;
 <LI>Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are used only for the
purposes for which they were intended;
 <LI>Other abusable substances (e.g., gasoline or aerosols) are
used only for their intended purposes; and
 <LI>Illegal drugs and tobacco are not used at all.
</UL><P>

The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) has been charged
since its inception in 1986 with providing guidance and leadership
in the Nation's prevention efforts. As a result of CSAP's efforts,
some basic premises regarding prevention have been established:<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Prevention strategies must be comprehensively structured to
reduce individual and environmental risk factors and to increase
resiliency factors in high-risk populations.

 <LI>Community involvement is a necessary component of an effective
prevention strategy; a shared relationship among all parties is
essential in the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
prevention efforts.
 <LI>Prevention must be intertwined with the general health care
and social services delivery systems and it must provide for a full
continuum of services.
 <LI>Prevention approaches and messages that are tailored to
differing population groups are most effective.
</UL><P>

Current prevention strategies reflect a relatively new approach
that was introduced in the 1970s and expanded in the 1980s.
Prevention research has become more sophisticated, with improved
evaluation techniques resulting in the development of a scientific
basis for prevention efforts. Prevention strategies are evolving as
new scientific findings shed light on promising approaches to
reducing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems.<P>

Since the mid-1980s, the prevention field has developed
sophisticated information dissemination and networking systems. A
centralized information source is available through CSAP's National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI). By calling
NCADI's toll-free telephone number, prevention practitioners can
get answers to their questions and access publications and
literature searches. CSAP's RADAR Network Centers operate as an
interactive communication system among people at the national,
State, and community levels. The RADAR Network allows members
around-the-clock access to information, publications, funding
source referrals, and audiovisual materials developed by Federal
agencies, Network members, and other organizations.<P>

In summary, prevention has developed into a respected, organized
discipline. Prevention offers communities an opportunity to stop
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems before they start, and
provides hope for effecting community change to support healthy
behaviors.<P>

<H1>Prevention Strategies</H1><P>

Prevention strategies targeting youth have evolved over the past 20
years as evaluation research reveals more about what works. Several
strategies are used effectively, especially in combination:<P>
<UL>
 <LI><EM>Information dissemination.</EM> This strategy provides
awareness and knowledge of the nature and extent of alcohol,
tobacco, and other drug use, abuse, and addiction and their effects
on individuals, families, and communities, as well as information
to increase perceptions of risk. It also provides knowledge and
awareness of prevention policies, programs, and services. It helps
set and reinforce norms (for example, underage drinking and drug
dealers will not be tolerated in this neighborhood).
 <LI><EM>Prevention education.</EM> This strategy aims to affect
critical life and social skills, including decision making, refusal
skills, critical analysis (for example, of media messages), and
systematic and judgmental abilities.
 <LI><EM>Alternatives.</EM> This strategy provides for the
participation of targeted populations in activities that exclude
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use by youth. Constructive and
healthy activities offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet the
needs usually filled by, alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use.
 <LI><EM>Problem identification and referral.</EM> This strategy
calls for identification, education, and counseling for those youth
who have indulged in age-inappropriate use of tobacco products or
alcohol, or who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs.
Activities under this strategy would 
include screening for tendencies toward substance abuse and
referral for preventive treatment for curbing such tendencies.
 <LI><EM>Community-based process.</EM> This strategy aims to
enhance the ability of the community to provide prevention and
treatment services to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use
disorders more effectively. Activities include organizing,
planning, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of 
services implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition
building, and networking. Building healthy communities encourages
healthy lifestyle choices.
 <LI><EM>Environmental approach.</EM> This strategy sets up or
changes written and unwritten community standards, codes, and
attitudes--influencing incidence and prevalence of alcohol,
tobacco, and other drug use problems in the general population.
Included are laws to restrict availability and access, price
increases, and community-wide actions.<P>

<H1>Risk Factors</H1><P>

Risk factors are characteristics that occur statistically more
often for those who develop alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
problems, either as adolescents or as adults. Recent research
points to a considerable number of such factors, including

It is important to recognize that risk factors are only indicators
for the potential of problem occurrence. While they can be helpful
in identifying children who are vulnerable to developing alcohol,
tobacco, or other drug 
problems, they are not necessarily predicative for an individual
child. Children growing up under adverse conditions often mature
into healthy, well-functioning adults. In addition, the use of risk
factors to label children poses its own risk. Consequently, there
is increasing attention on those factors that seem to protect
children from developing alcohol, tobacco, or other drug
problems.<P>

There are no simple solutions for helping youth at high risk for
developing alcohol, tobacco, or other drug problems. Reducing risk
factors and fostering resiliency are part of a comprehensive
approach to prevention, and are consistent with a public health
approach to reducing problems.<P>

<h3><i>Prevention Primer:</i></h3>
<H1>Resilience/Protective Factors</H1><P>

Many youths, although living in high-risk environments, seem to
possess personal resilience that helps them avoid alcohol, tobacco,
and other drug problems. One current challenge to the prevention
field is to identify these protective factors and determine how
they can be instilled in all youth in high-risk environments.<P>

The following is a checklist of youth protective factors:<P>
<OL>
 <LI><EM>Community Environment</EM>
 <UL>
  <LI>Middle or upper class
  <LI>Low unemployment
  <LI>Adequate housing
  <LI>Pleasant neighborhood
  <LI>Low prevalence of neighborhood crime
  <LI>Good school
  <LI>School that promotes learning, participation, and
responsibility
  <LI>High-quality health care
  <LI>Easy access to adequate social services
  <LI>Flexible social service providers who put clients' needs
first
 </OL>
 <LI><EM>Family Environment</EM>
 <UL>
  <LI>Adequate family income
  <LI>Structured and nurturing family
  <LI>Parents promote learning
  <LI>Fewer than four children in family
  <LI>Two or more years between the birth of each child
  <LI>Few chronic stressful life events
  <LI>Multi-generational kinship network
  <LI>Non-kin support network, e.g., supportive role models,
dependable substitute child care
  <LI>Warm, close personal relationship with parent(s) and/or other
adult(s)
  <LI>Little marital conflict
  <LI>Family stability and cohesiveness
  <LI>Plenty of attention during first year of life
  <LI>Sibling as caretaker/confidante
  <LI>Clear behavior guidelines
 </UL>
 <LI><EM>Constitutional Strengths</EM>
 <UL>
  <LI>Adequate early sensorimotor and language development
  <LI>High intelligence
  <LI>Physically robust
  <LI>No emotional or temperamental impairments
 </UL>
 <LI><EM>Personality of the Child</EM>
 <UL>
  <LI>Affectionate/endearing
  <LI>Easy temperament
  <LI>Autonomous
  <LI>Adaptable and flexible
  <LI>Positive outlook
  <LI>Healthy expectations
  <LI>Self-efficacy
  <LI>Self-discipline
  <LI>Internal locus of control
  <LI>Problem-solving skills
  <LI>Socially adept
  <LI>Tolerance of people and situations
 </UL>
</OL><P>

If the high-risk environment is the family itself, for instance if
children are growing up in an alcoholic or drug abusing family,
studies suggest that they have a better chance of growing into
healthy adulthood if they:<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Can learn to do one thing well that is valued by themselves,
their friends, and their community;
 <LI>Are required to be helpful as they grow up;
 <LI>Are able to ask for help for themselves;
 <LI>Are able to elicit positive responses from others in their
environment;
 <LI>Are able to distance themselves from their dysfunctional
families so that the family is not their sole frame of reference;
 <LI>Are able to bond with some socially valued, positive entity,
such as the family, school, community groups, or church;
 <LI>Are able to interact with a (perceived to be) caring adult who
provides consistent caring responses.
</UL><P>

Resiliency factors, along with risk factors, need to be more widely
publicized for the use of parents, gatekeepers, and prevention
planners. While many of the factors listed are the result of
external forces, those factors that may be taught or instilled in
children can provide some protection to youths at high risk for
alcohol, tobacco, or other drug problems.<P>

<h3><i>Prevention Primer:</i></h3>
<H1>Healthy People 2000</H1><P>

<CITE>Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention Objectives</CITE> was adopted by the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services in 1990. <CITE>Healthy People 2000</CITE>
is a statement of national opportunities. It is the product of a
national effort, involving 22 expert working groups, almost 300
national organizations, all the State health departments, and the

<h2> A Fence or an Ambulance </h2>
<h3> [A poetic case for the value of prevention]</h3> 
<img src="bar3.gif">

<p>
'Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed, <br>
Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant; <br>
But over its terrible edge there had slipped <br>
A duke and full many a peasant. <br>
So the people said something would have to be done, <br>
But their projects did not at all tally; <br>
Some said, "Put a fence 'round the edge of the cliff," <br>
Some, "An ambulance down in the valley." <br>
<p>
But the cry for the ambulance carried the day, <br>
For it spread through the neighboring city; <br>
A fence may be useful or not, it is true, <br>
But each heart became full of pity <br>
For those who slipped over the dangerous cliff; <br>
And the dwellers in highway and alley <br>
Gave pounds and gave pence, not to put up a fence, <br>
But an ambulance down in the valley. <br>
<p>
"For the cliff is all right, if your careful," they said, <br>
"And, if folks even slip and are dropping, <br>
It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much <br>
As the shock down below when they're stopping." <br>
So day after day, as these mishaps occurred, <br>
Quick forth would those rescuers sally <br>
To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff, <br>
With their ambulance down in the valley. <br>
<p>
Then an old sage remarked: "It's a marvel to me <br>
That people give far more attention <br>
To repairing results than to stopping the cause, <br>
When they'd much better aim at prevention. <br>
Let us stop at its source all this mischief," cried he, <br>
"Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally; <br>
If the cliff we will fence, we might almost dispense <br>
With the ambulance down in the valley." <br>
<p>
"Oh he's a fanatic," the others rejoined, <br>
"Dispense with the ambulance?  Never! <br>
He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could; <br>
No!  No!  We'll support them forever. <br>
Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall? <br>
And shall this man dictate to us?  Shall he? <br>
Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence, <br>
While the ambulance works in the valley?" <br>
<p>
But the sensible few, who are practical too, <br>
Will not bear with such nonsense much longer; <br>
They believe that prevention is better than cure, <br>
And their party will soon be the stronger. <br>
Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen, <br>
And while other philanthropists dally, <br>
They will scorn all pretense, and put up a stout fence <br>
On the cliff that hangs over the valley. <br>
<p>
Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old, <br>
For the voice of true wisdom is calling. <br>
"To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best <br>
To prevent other people from falling." <br>
Better close up the source of temptation and crime <br>
Than deliver from dungeon or galley; <br>
<b>Better put a strong fence 'round the top of the cliff <br>
Than an ambulance down in the valley. </b> 
<p>
<p>
<p>
-- Joseph Malins (1895)

<h1>The Old Man and the Starfish
</h1>
<h2> An allegorical tale demonstrating the value of helping others</h2>
<img src="bar3.gif"></center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Once upon a time, there was an old fisherman who lived in a cottage
near the sea.  Every morning, the old man arose from his sleep, dressed, 
and went down to the seashore for a walk.  Every morning, the shore was 
littered with starfish who had washed ashore during the night.  Every 
morning, the old man picked up starfish who were struggling on the shore 
and tossed them back into the sea.  This act of kindness <b>prevented</b> 
the starfish from dying in the heat of the sun later in the morning.
<p>
One morning, after a particularly heavy storm, the shore was thick with
struggling starfish.  The old man was actively engaged in tossing them back
into the sea, when a bright young man approached him and asked him what
he was doing.  "I'm rescuing starfish who are stranded on the shore, so
they won't die baking in the sun," the old man replied.  The young man 
looked at him with astonishment.  "Look at the shore!  It's covered with
starfish!  There's no way you can save them all!  You're just wasting your
time!  What you're doing just doesn't matter in the big picture," the young
man said.
<p>
The old man shrugged, picked up another starfish, and tossed it into the sea.
"It mattered to that one," he replied.
<p>
Sometimes prevention professionals seem overwhelmed.  The magnitude of alcohol,
tobacco, and other drug problems sometimes makes our task seem hopeless.  Some
days, we are tempted to adopt the young man's despair -- we think that what
we are doing isn't working -- that it just doesn't matter.  We need to remember
the old man's approach.  Look for our successes, and rejoice in them.  
Remember the ones that we <b>do</b> help, and don't despair about the ones
that we missed.

<h1>MOPS, BUCKETS, AND PREVENTION
</h1>
<h2>A metaphorical explanation of the value of prevention</h2>
<img src="bar3.gif"></center>
<p>
<p>
One day a few years ago, when I lived in a large apartment complex, I came
home from work to find my kitchen flooded, and water dripping from the
ceiling above.  I immediately called the emergency maintenance number, and
the person who answered suggested that I first "put a bucket under the drip,"
and, second, "then mop up the water." 
<p>
This approach reminded me of the problem with our current drug policies.  We
have a "mop and bucket" approach to dealing with drug problems.  The bucket
is a metaphor for drug law enforcement strategies -- "capture and contain." 
We arrest and convict drug users, and contain them in prisons.  The mop is a
metaphor for drug treatment strategies -- "clean up the mess after it occurs."
We wait for people to become addicts, and then try to help them become
abstinent.
<p>
The problem with these approaches, is that we will never be able to afford,
or even provide, enough mops and buckets to solve our drug problems.  We
build prison after prison, and fill them with users.  When they get full,
we must either build another prison, or release some of the old convicts
to make room for the new ones ("dump the bucket").  We mop and mop and mop,
and try to help addicts get sober, but there will never be enough mops to keep
the floor dry, and there will never be enough treatment slots to help every
addict.
<p>
Now, I'm a supporter of both law enforcement and treatment programs.  They
play important roles in the <b>short term</b> response to drug problems.
As long as the leak is dripping, we will need mops and buckets.  But just
like the leaky ceiling, something more is needed.  If we want to solve the
problem, we need to go to its source and "fix" the problem.  We need to find
the leak and repair it.  This is a metaphor for prevention.  Prevention seeks
to identify the source of a problem, and them seeks to repair the problem at
its source -- preventing the leak in the first place.
<p>
Good prevention programs examine the situation in their community, and find
existing problems and repair them (risk factor mitigation), or take a
proactive approach and do preventive maintenance to make sure that the leaks
never begin in the first place (protective factor enhancement).
<p>
<b>PREVENTION</b> is the key to a long-term solution to our drug problems.

<h2><img src="tgci.gif" align right><a name=Course>The Grantsmanship Center's Proposal Writing Workshop 
</a></h2>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center, in cooperation with the National Training Team from 
<b> The Grantsmanship Center, </b> sponsors a five-day Granstmanship Proposal Writing 
Workshop twice each year, to improve the grantwriting capacity of Indiana prevention 
professionals.  The usual cost of enrolling in this workshop, when purchased from The 
Grantsmanship Center, is approximately $800, including meals and materials.  Qualified 
prevention professionals from Indiana may participate in the IPRC-sponsored workshops for a 
reduced fee of $100 to partially cover the costs of meals and refreshment breaks.  The cost of materials and the training 
is absorbed by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center.  Each workshop is limited to a 
maximum enrollment of 25 persons.
<p>
The next workshop is scheduled for the week of March 17-21, 1997 in Bloomington.
<p>
Previous workshops have been held in Bloomington, Indianapolis, and Merrillville.
<p>
For further information on this week-long workshop, contact the IPRC.

<p>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center hasts a specially-tailored version of <b> The
Grantsmanship Center</b>'s five-day Proposal Writing Workshop, to help develop
proposal writing capacity in alcohol and other drug prevention professionals.  
<b><i>This special version of the workshop focuses specifically on developing
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) prevention proposals to federal and
foundation funding sources.</i></b>  The lead trainer is V.C. League, a
nationally recognized expert in ATOD issues, who has trained for The 
Grantsmanship Center for more than 20 years.
<p>
Designed for both the novice and the experienced grant seeker, this workshop
covers all aspects of researching for grants, writing grant proposals, and
negotiating with funding sources.  The program teaches the use of the Center's
proposal writing format, the most widely used in the world.  During the class,
you will search out funding for your agency using a wealth of materials
available at the workshop.  With a team you will also develop a proposal for 
your agency or help a classmate develop a proposal.  You will leave this
workshop possessing new skills and understanding how to apply these skills
to the needs of your own organization.
<p>
<h3>The Workshop Agenda</h3>
This is an intensive five-day program combining instruction and practical
exercises to take you step-by-step through all the stages of writing a
grant proposal.  In the first part of the workshop you will learn all the
essentials of proposal writing.  Working on your own, and in small groups,
you'll develop and critique proposal elements -- focusing on your own agency.  
You will also serve as a panelist, evaluating a proposal brought to class by 
a participant -- or bring in your own proposal for review.
<p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
The Grantsmanship Center's usual registration fee for this workshop is $695 
per trainee for the training, plus registrants pay at least $100 for meals 
and breaks.  The Indiana Prevention Resource Center offers this training (to 
representatives of registered Indiana prevention programs only) 
for a reduced fee of $100, to partially cover the expenses of meals and
breaks.  The fee is non-refundable.  The remaining funding is provided by 
the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration - Division of 
Mental Health.  <b>Participants are responsible for providing their own
transportation to the training site, lodging, and evening meal expenses.</b>
<p>
Each workshop is limited to 25 participants, who are assigned to 
five-person workgorups to assure personal attention for each participant.  
Enrollment is limited to no more than two trainees per agency, and may
be apportioned by the IPRC to assure geographic equity within Indiana.
<hr>
<i><b>The Grantsmanship Center</b></i> is the world's oldest amd largest
fundraising training organization.  Founded in 1972, the Center has trained 
more than 50,000 staff members from nonprofit and government agencies.  
A two-year long evaluation of this program found that an average of 
$177,000 per person in new grants and contracts has been attributed to
this program by a group of 872 graduates.

<b><i>This special version of the workshop focuses specifically on developing

 </i></b>
<p>
It takes more than passion and a good cause to ensure your organization's survival.
 It takes know-how. It takes planning. And it takes money. 
<p>
Like most nonprofits, your organization faces hard times ahead. Government funding is being drastically cut. Competition for foundation grants is more heated than ever. You need to
develop a comprehensive fundraising strategy now to secure your organization's future. 
<p>
That's what you'll learn to do in this intensive new workshop from The Grantsmanship Center. You will: 
<p>
      Evaluate your organization's fundraising potential, based on a realistic assessment of its mission, its resources, and its strengths and weaknesses. 
      Examine the full range of fundraising techniques - including direct mail, special events, membership programs, annual fund drives, capital campaigns, major gift solicitation,
      planned giving - and identify those that will work best for your agency. 
      Develop the core elements of a fundraising plan to meet your own organization's specific needs. 
<p>
This program combines structured analysis, focused discussions, and small-group exercises. Class size is limited to 25. 
<p>
You can expect to work hard and come away with a wealth of practical experience. Not only will you enhance your own professional skills, you will start designing a strategic
fundraising plan to keep your organization strong.

<p>
The State of Indiana, through the Division of Mental Health, is in the process of re-focusing its 
efforts to prevent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems, in order to make them more 
effective in reducing the prevalence of those problems in the state, and to reduce the fiscal and 
personal costs associated with substance abuse.  The division is committed to increasing the 
benefits that its funded prevention activities provide to Indiana residents.  This will be 
accomplished by re-focusing its community-based prevention efforts to reduce overlap with 
school-based efforts and to concentrate its efforts on that segment of the population most likely 
to initiate use and abuse, and whose behaviors are most likely to be affected by proven 
prevention strategies -- 10- through 14-year old youth at average or moderate risk of 
developing substance abuse problems.  To that end, the division wishes to establish a network 
of fourteen "Local Prevention Services Coalitions," operated and managed by contractor(s), which 
will coordinate "Direct Prevention Services Programs," in a defined service area.
<p>
Each contractor shall be responsible for creating, implementing, and managing a Coalition of 
Direct Prevention Service Programs in its defined service area.  The selected contractor will be 
expected to recruit collaborating member agencies in each county in its defined service area to 
implement Direct Prevention Services Programs in accordance with the specifications set forth 
below.  The Coalition will consist of at least six independent, service-providing organizations 
that provide direct substance abuse prevention services to targeted youth within the defined 
service area.  In order to implement these Direct Prevention Services Programs, the contractor 
will be required to enter into subcontracts with at least five other organizations, and to 
collaborate with other "volunteer collaborating organizations" that will provide assistance, 
materials, and/or services to the Direct Prevention Services Programs.
<p>
The selected contractor will be expected to provide fiscal oversight, technical assistance, and 
coordination for the members of the Coalition.  The selected contractor will be expected to 
implement an evaluation process specified by the Division of Mental Health to evaluate the 
processes, outcomes, and impacts of each Direct Prevention Services Program and of the 
Coalition.

<h3>I.  Background</a></h3>
<p>
Since the federal Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was signed into law in 
October, 1986, the federal government has provided more than $6 billion in funding for local 
substance abuse prevention programs -- mostly through block grants to the states.  Since 1987, 
the Indiana Division of Mental Health has awarded more than $50 million in federal block 
grant funding to community-based prevention programs; over the same period, the Indiana 
Department of Education has awarded an additional $40 million in federal block grant funding 
to local education agencies for school-based prevention programs.  In 1987, when this funding 
began, little was known about the types of prevention strategies that were most likely to 
produce positive results, and little was known about which target populations and which 
strategies produced the most efficient and effective impact upon reducing problems associated 
with substance abuse.  Without this information, the Division of Mental Health (DMH) relied 
upon funding rationales described in proposals submitted to it by potential prevention 
contractors around the state.  Without solid research and theoretical evidence on which to base 
a funding policy, potential contractors were free to propose any prevention program that 
appeared to be appropriate.  This resulted in the funding of many diverse programs which were 
individually logical and which were based upon "good faith" beliefs of program impact.  
However, this funding strategy did not focus upon any particular population segment, and did 
not produce an equitable geographic balance of funding.  Many of the funded programs served 
very small populations, or populations that were at such high risk that intervention and 
treatment strategies would have been more appropriate.  Large segments of the population 
were left unserved, and some programs served such small populations that they produced a 
very high per capita cost.
<p>
Now, with a decade of research and evaluation evidence from more than $6 billion of 
federally funded prevention programming, a much clearer image of effective prevention 
programming has emerged.  There now is sufficient evidence to suggest that certain prevention 
strategies have documented their effectiveness in reducing the consequences of alcohol and 
other drug use, and that focusing prevention efforts on certain populations are more likely to 
produce positive results.  As it entered its second decade of prevention funding, DMH 
determined to utilize this newly gained information to improve the statewide impact of its 
investment in prevention programs.  The guiding principle in the development of the new 
DMH funding policy is to direct the limited prevention dollars available to programs that are 
most likely to produce the greatest positive impact upon the prevalence of substance abuse 
problems in Indiana.  This meant that prevention funding needed to be focused upon those 
populations whose substance-abusing behaviors are most likely to be influenced by prevention 
strategies, and upon strategies that reach the largest numbers of those populations with 
prevention strategies that have demonstrated impact upon substance-abusing behaviors.  It also 
meant that a priority needed to be given to strategies that demonstrated their ability to produce 
the greatest behavioral impact at a reasonable per capita cost.

The punchline to an often told joke suggests that the reason medical journals 
use technical jargon is to make sure that only doctors understand the message.  
With regard to recent medical journal discussions of alcoholic beverage doses
and blood alcohol levels, however, a not-so-funny result of the latest extreme
in technical jargon is that even doctors often don't understand the message.  
In an attempt to develop an "international standard" for measurements 
described in scientific publications, the so-called <i>Systeme Internationale </i>
requires that journals describe doses of beverage alcohol in terms of "grams,"
rather than "ounces," and the blood levels are described in terms of 
"millimoles per liter," instead of the usual "percent of alcohol by volume"
measurement. 
<p>
This means that, instead of describing the ingestion of two, twelve ounce
beers containing one ounce of absolute alcohol, the medical journal speaks
about ingestion of 28.5 grams alcohol.  Instead of describing the level of
alcohol in a patient's blood as 0.10% (or 100 mg/dL) the level is described 
as 22 mmol/L!  This system certainly is confusing for the layperson, and is
likely to create comprehension problems for many physicians as well.
<p>
<img align=left src="/graphics/photographs/drugs/wine.jpg">
A "millimole" is one one-thousandth of a "mole."  A "mole" is defined as
the amount of a substance contained in exactly 6.02 x
<nobr>10<sup>23</sup></nobr> [<b>NOTE:  This number is and should be reading as 
"ten to the twenty-third power."]</b>  molecules of a substance 
(6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> is called "Avogadro's number," and is the number of
atoms in 12 grams of pure Carbon).  What that has to do with a person's
level of intoxication is beyond most people's comprehension.  Any physician 
whose mind makes
such a logical connection is likely to be unable to communicate on a level his
or her patients can understand.  Anyone who orders drinks by the gram will 
probably be presumed to be intoxicated and refused service!
<p>
Add to this discussion the differences between measures of the percentage of 
alcohol "by volume" versus "by weight," different systems of measuring the
"proof" of an alcoholic beverage, medical versus legal standards for measuring
blood alcohol levels, and discussions of calorie content and specific gravity.  
If you are confused, you are not alone.

<h3>ALCOHOL DOSES</h3>
Further complicating discussions of amounts of alcohol is the difference
between potency measures based upon "percent of alcohol by volume" and
measures based upon "percent of alcohol by weight."  Since alcohol weighs
less than water, any discussion about the proportion of alcohol in a
beverage must specify whether the comparison is "by weight" or "by volume."
A pint of water weights about one pound (16 ounces).  A pint of pure alcohol 
weighs about 12.8 ounces.  If one pint of pure alcohol is mixed with one
pint of water, the result is a beverage that is 50% alcohol "by volume."
If one pound of pure alcohol is mixed with one pound of pure water, the
result is a beverage that is 50% alcohol "by weight."  Since one pound of
water 16 fluid ounces, and one pound of alcohol is about 20 fluid ounces,
the 36 total fluid ounces in a resulting beverage is about 55.5% alcohol
"by volume," although it is 50% "by weight."  As an example of the
importance of specifying the system used to measure the percentage of
alcohol in a beverage, Coors Brewing Company promotional materials 
describe "Zima" as containing 3.7% alcohol by weight; 4.6% alcohol by 
volume.  To convert measures by weight into measures by volume (or visa versa),
use a conversion factor of 0.79.

<h4>Measures of Potency; "Proof"</h4>
The strength of an alcoholic beverage is usually expressed as either the
percentage of absolute alcohol by volume, or as "proof."  In the USA, 
proof is a measure of the amount of absolute alcohol in distilled spirits, 
and is calculated as the number of parts of alcohol in 200 parts of 
beverage at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (a beverage that is 50% alcohol is 
"100 proof;" a beverage that is 43% alcohol is "86 proof").  Under the
American system, one "proof" is equal to one-half percent of alcohol by
volume.
<p>
The concept of "proof" emerged prior to the 18th century, when few people
had the equipment necessary to make precise measurements of the percentage
of alcohol in a beverage.  Exotic formulas, such as igniting a mixture of 
equal parts of the beverage and gunpowder, were used to test the proof of
distilled spirits.
<p>
A different system for measuring proof is used in England,  In England, 
proof is measured by comparing equal volumes of water and the beverage at
51 degrees Fahrenheit.  100 proof is set at the point at which the beverage
weighs 12/13th as much as water.  This means that a beverage that is said
to be 100 proof under the British system is 114.2 proof under the American
system.  A beverage that is 100 proof under the American system is said to
be 87.6 proof under the British system.
<h4>Alcohol Doses</h4>
The <b>dose</b> of alcohol is calculated by multiplying the volume of an
alcoholic beverage by the percentage of alcohol by volume.  For 
example, twelve ounces of beer that is 4% alcohol by volume would have
a dose of 0.48 ounces of alcohol.  Pure alcohol (100% alcohol) is called
"absolute alcohol."  Absolute alcohol is alcohol without any water molecules
in it.  Alcohol produced by distillation contains water molecules that are
very hard to remove. The strongest readily available alcoholic beverage, often
called "neutral grain spirits" is about 95% absolute alcohol (190 proof).
It is possible to manufacture absolute alcohol, also called "scientific
alcohol," by synthesis.
<p>
The dose of alcohol in a typical 12 ounce can of beer, is approximately equal
to the dose of alcohol in a 4 to 5 ounce serving of wine, or in a "shot"
of whiskey.  This average-sized dose of alcohol is equal to one-half ounce of
absolute alcohol, and is sometimes called a <b>"drink equivalent."</b>

<h4>Calorie Content of Alcoholic Beverages</h4>

One gram of ethyl alcohol yields 7 calories of energy when metabolized by
the body.  That converts of approximately 200 calories per ounce of
absolute alcohol, or about 100 calories per drink equivalent (one-half
ounce of absolute alcohol). The total calorie content of an alcoholic
beverage includes the calories from the alcohol itself, and calories from
other components of the beverage (residual sugars or grains in beers and
wines, for example).  A typical serving of regular beer yields about 150 
calories (about 100 calories from the alcohol and about 50 calories from the
 residual carbohydrates).  A typical serving of light beer has a lower
alcohol content and less residual carbohydrates, so the total calorie 
content could be about 100 calories (about 80 calories from the alcohol
and about 20 calories from the residual carbohydrates).

<h3>BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS</h3>

<h4>Conversion Factors for Alternative Measurements</h4>

The most common system for measuring and reporting Blood Alcohol Levels (BAL)
is calculated using the weight of alcohol (milligrams) and the volume of blood
(deciliter).  This yields a Blood Alcohol Concentration that can be expressed
as a percentage (ie. 0.10% alcohol by volume), or as a proportion (ie. 100 mg.
per deciliter).  This system is the one prescribed by almost every state, and is
sometimes referred to as the "weight by volume" or "w/v" method.
<p>
A few states prescribe a "weight by weight" or "w/w" method (milligrams of alcohol
in milligrams of blood).  For forensic evidence purposes, the w/w can be calculated
by dividing the w/v by a factor or 1.055 (the average specific gravity of blood).
<p>
Although most evidentiary rules specify that the proportion of alcohol
in the whole blood by used to measure the level of intoxication, most 
hospitals routinely calculate the proportion of a drug in the plasma portion
of the blood.  While this measurement is the most useful one for medical
purposes, it is not the appropriate one for most legal purposes.  Since
the addition of red and white blood cells would add to the blood volume
that dilutes the alcohol, using only the plasma fraction would result in
a percentage of alcohol that is higher than would be found in whole blood.  
Although there is some variation from person to person, depending upon the
density of their bloods, the average adjustment factor is 1.16.  In other
words, to estimate the alcohol level in whole blood using the alcohol 
level in blood plasma, divide by 1.16.  For example, a plasma alcohol
level of 0.15% would convert to a blood alcohol level of 0.13%.

        <h1>Selected INDIANA ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LAWS
        </h1>
        <p>
        <hr>
        <p>
        
        Under the U. S. Constitution, each state maintains primary responsibility for regulating the use 
        of  alcoholic  beverages  within its borders. While many of  Indiana's  most  unusual  alcoholic 
        beverage  laws (such as the ban against drinking while standing up, or the ban  against  women 
        sitting on a bar stool) have been repealed, Indiana laws concerning the use of alcoholic  beverages
        differ from the laws in many other states. This brief summary of Indiana law is  intended 
        to assist adults in making responsible decisions about the use of alcohol.
        <p>
        <hr>
        <em>[A  complete listing of Indiana alcoholic beverage laws would occupy  several  hundred 
        pages.   The summary below is intended to provide an overview of some of the  sections  most 
        relevant to university students. It is not intended to provide legal advice. Persons needing legal 
        advice should consult an attorney.]</em>

        <h3>ALCOHOL USE BY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 21.</h3></a>
        <p>
        Indiana law states "It is a class C misdemeanor for a minor to knowingly: (l) possess an alcoholic 
        beverage; (2) consume it; or (3) transport it on a public highway when not accompanied 
        by at least one of his parents or guardians." The term "minor" is defined by Indiana alcoholic 
        beverage laws as "a person less than twenty-one [21] years of age.
        <p>
        It also is illegal for a minor:
        <ul>
        <p>
        <li>To misrepresent his or her age for the purpose of obtaining alcoholic beverages.   (Class 
        C  infraction;  in addition, a minor who uses a false or altered driver's license, or  the  driver's 
        license of another person...shall have the minor's driver's license revoked for a period of up to 
        one year.)
        <li>To  furnish  false or altered identification of any type for the purpose of  providing  evidence
        of age to obtain alcohol. (Class C misdemeanor; if the fake i.d. is a driver's license, that license shall be revoked for a period of up to one year) 
        <li>To have in his or her possession false or fraudulent evidence of age. (Class C infraction)
        <li>To  drive an automobile being used to transport alcoholic beverages, unless  the  minor's 
        parent  or  legal guardian is present in the car. [Note: When a minor operates a  motor  vehicle 
        containing  ANY alcoholic beverage s/he is subject to arrest, unless a parent or legal  guardian 
        is in the car. A 21+ year-old friend does NOT qualify a minor to operate a vehicle  containing 
        an  alcoholic beverage. It is no defense that the beverage belongs to someone else or that it  is 
        unopened.] (Class C misdemeanor; the car may also be seized by the state.)
        <li>To  "be  in a tavern, bar, or other public place where alcoholic beverages are  sold, 
        bartered,  exchanged, given away, provided, or furnished." (Class C misdemeanor; in addition  to 
        the  criminal penalty, the minor's driver's license shall be revoked for up to one year  even  if  
        no i.d. was used) 
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>CAUTION ON FAKE I.D.s</h3>
        Under certain circumstances, local prosecutors have used the "criminal code," rather than the 
        "alcoholic beverage code," to prosecute users of fake IDs. Class A misdemeanor charges of 
        "deception," and Class C felony charges of "forgery" have sometimes been filed.  Also,  under 
        a new <B>federal</B> law possession or use of fake or altered driver's licenses or state or 
        federal ID cards can be punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 and/or a five year jail term!

        <h3>GENERAL RULES (Apply to Anyone, regardless of age):</h3></a>
        <p>
        It is illegal:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>To  be  in a public place in a state of intoxication (also known as  "public  intoxication"). 
        (Class B misdemeanor)
        <li>To  sell, barter, exchange, provide, or furnish an alcoholic beverage to a minor.   (Class 
        C misdemeanor)
        <li>To sell, barter, deliver, or give away an alcoholic beverage to person who is intoxicated. 
        (Class B misdemeanor)
        <li>To  sell,  barter, exchange, give, provide, or furnish an alcoholic beverage  to  a  person 
        known to be a habitual drunkard. (Class B misdemeanor)
        <li>To  hinder,  obstruct,  interfere with, or prevent the observance  or  enforcement  of  the 
        Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Code. (Class C misdemeanor)
        <li>For  a person 21 years of age or over to encourage aid, or induce a minor to  unlawfully 
        possess or use an alcoholic beverage. (Class C infraction)
        <li>To  take  an alcoholic beverage into a bar, restaurant, or place  of  public  entertainment. 
        (Class C misdemeanor) [Indiana Law prohibits patrons from taking any alcoholic beverage into 
        any  bar or other place with a liquor license. It also prohibits taking liquor into  any  restaurant 
        or place of public entertainment.]
        <li>To  Possess  alcoholic beverages on which Indiana tax has been unpaid  to  transport  un-
        taxed beverages into the state. (Class B misdemeanor)
        <li>To  directly  or  indirectly charge for alcoholic beverages  without  a  license  (including 
        charging  for  food, entertainment, cups, napkins, tokens, etc. where  alcoholic  beverages  are 
        distributed   there  are  no loopholes). (Class B misdemeanor) [NOTE: A  one-day  temporary  permit  is  easily obtained. This permit allows you to charge for beer or wine, but  also  allows police inspection of the premises without a warrant.  Rules on minors, etc. would still apply.]

        <a name=Driving>
        <h3>DRINKING AND DRIVING:</h3></a>
        <p>
        It is illegal:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>To  operate  a motor vehicle while intoxicated (under the influence of alcohol,  any  
        controlled  substance,  any other drug, or any combination of alcohol, controlled  substances,  and 
        other drugs). (Class A misdemeanor; second offense is Class D felony) 
        <li>To  operate  a motor vehicle with 0.10% or more alcohol in the blood, even  if  intoxication
        is not proven. (Class C misdemeanor; second offense is Class D felony) 
        <li>To operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated or with 0.10% or more alcohol in the blood 
        if said operation results in serious bodily injury to another person. (Class D felony)
        <li>To operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated or with 0.10% or more alcohol in the blood 
        if said operation results in the death of another person. (Class C felony) 
        <li>To consume an alcoholic beverage while operating a vehicle. (Class B infraction)
        <li>To  operate a vehicle with a 0.04% or more alcohol in the blood if an open container  of 
        alcohol is present in the vehicle. (Class B infraction)
        <p>
        Indiana  law  states that anyone operating a motor vehicle within the state gives  "implied  consent"
        to submit to a chemical test of intoxication (breath, blood, or urine). Failure to submit  to 
        the  test  may  be presented as evidence against the driver in court and will  result  in  a  longer 
        driver's  license suspension than if the driver took the test and failed it. The courts  have  ruled 
        that  failure  to cooperate with a test will constitute refusal in the eyes of the  court.  Since  the 
        expert  testimony  of  police officers and videotapes of the driver after arrest  will  be  used  as 
        evidence  to prove intoxication, the consequences of refusing to take the test are almost  always 
        worse than the consequences of failing the test itself.
        <p>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h4>"Open Container" Laws</h4>
        <p>
        Effective  July  1, 1994, two new sections were added to Indiana state law,  making  it  illegal:    
        (1)  for  a driver to consume an alcoholic beverage while the motor vehicle  is  being  operated 
        upon  a public highway (Class B Infraction), or (2) to operate a vehicle with a BAC  of  0.04% 
        or  more  alcohol  in  the blood and to knowingly allow a container  of  alcohol  that  has  been 
        opened,  that has a broken seal, or from which some of the contents have been removed, to  be 
        in the passenger compartment of the vehicle (Class B infraction).
        <p>
        At least 38 local communities (including Bloomington and Monroe County, Indianapolis, South 
        Bend, and West Lafayette) have enacted local "open container" ordinances that are more 
        restrictive than the state law.  Most ban any open container within a vehicle, regardless of the 
        driver's BAC.  Local laws may be enforced as well as the state law.
        <p>
        
        <h3>"Catch 22" Rule:</h3>
 <p>
        If you think you have discovered a "loophole" that would allow you to violate the law think 
        again. In order to close any such "loophole," the General Assembly passed a provision which 
        states: "For the purposes of this title [the Alcoholic Beverage code] whenever a person is 
        prohibited from doing a certain act...directly, he shall be prohibited also from doing that 
        act...indirectly."
        <p>
        <a name=Penalties>
        <h3>PENALTIES</h3></a>
        <p>
        <b>Statutory Penalties (Maximums):</b>
        <table border=2>
        <tr><td>Classification</td> <td>Imprisonment</td> <td>Fine</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Class C Felony</td>    <td>5 years usual (2 to 8)</td> <td>up to $10,000 </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Class D Felony</td>    <td>2 years usual (1 to 4)</td> <td>up to $10,000 </td></tr>                                                                                    
        <tr><td>Class A Misdemeanor</td> <td>up to 1 year </td> <td>up to $ 5,000 </td></tr>  
        <tr><td>Class B Misdemeanor</td> <td>up to 180 days</td> <td>up to $ 1,000 </td></tr>   
        <tr><td>Class C Misdemeanor</td> <td>up to 60 days</td> <td>up to $ 500 </td></tr>    
        <tr><td>Class B Infraction</td>  <td>none </td> <td>up to $ 1,000 </td></tr>
        <tr><td>Class C Infraction</td>  <td>none </td> <td>up to $ 500 </td></tr>     


        </table>
        <p>
        In addition to the penalties shown above, police will confiscate and dispose of all 
        alcoholic beverages and containers (including kegs and taps) involved in any violation of the 
        alcoholic beverage laws. Automobiles or other vehicles used to transport alcohol illegally may 
        also be seized and disposed of.
        <p>
        In addition to the criminal penalty for misdemeanors or felonies of driving while intoxicated or 
        with 0.10% or more alcohol in the blood, the driver's license shall be suspended for at least 90 
        days for a first offense and up to two years for a second offense. (On a first offense, the judge 
        is empowered to reduce the suspension to 30 days and then permit a "restricted" license limiting
        driving privileges to "to and from work or court" for 180 days.) A third offense could 
        result in a ten year suspension.

<H2>ACTION STEPS FOR PARENTS and CAREGIVERS</H2><h3>How to Talk to Your Family About Marijuana</h3>

<UL>
<LI>Talk with your children about marijuana and other drugs
and listen to their pressures and problems. Be clear and consistent
in your &quot;no-use&quot; rules and messages.</LI>

<LI>Be aware of the connection between marijuana and other risky
behaviors. Car crashes, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS,
and injuries have all been linked to marijuana use.</LI>

<LI>Help your child deal with peer pressure. Practice ways for
him or her to refuse drugs in ways that fit your child's personality.</LI>

<LI>Help children and adolescents learn the health, safety,
and legal consequences of using marijuana and other drugs. Be
sure they understand that marijuana can be as dangerous as other
illegal drugs.</LI>

<LI>Model and encourage good health practices: serve balanced
and nutritious meals at regular times and plan fun family activities.
Encourage individual expression and creativity.</LI>

<LI>Be sure children have easy access to a wide range of appealing,
drug-free, alternative activities and safe, monitored areas where
they can gather; work with others in your community -- clubs,
schools, churches, and neighborhood groups -- to sponsor and promote
safe, healthy activities.
</LI>

<LI>Discuss pro-use marijuana and drug images that youth see
in the movies and on TV, and hear on CD's and on the radio. Ask
what they think about these messages. Do they understand their
purpose? Do they recognize that these messages do not teach the
harmful effects of these products?</LI>

<LI>Be a positive role model. Do not engage in any illegal,
unhealthy, or dangerous drug use practices. Provide an example
consistent with your messages to youth.</LI>

<LI>Be tolerant of a child's individuality. Accept a child for
his or her talents and personality. Provide love, support and
encouragement to the child in your life.</LI>

<H2>Action Steps for Youth</H2><h3>How to Deal with Marijuana</h3>

<UL>
<LI>Get media wise.  Discuss and analyze popular movies, music
videos, and television shows that promote and glamorize marijuana
and other drugs.  Contact the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol
and Drug Information (NCADI) at 1-800-729-6686 (or on the Internet,
<A HREF="http://www.health.org">http://www.health.org</A>) for information
about media literacy resources
for youth.  Talk with parents and other trusted adults about these
issues.</LI>

<LI>Get the facts about marijuana and other drugs.  Call your
local health department, city or county substance abuse agency,
or information clearinghouses such as NCADI, to get information
about marijuana and other drugs.  Ask librarians to help you get
answers to your questions. Order materials for yourself, friends,
parents and adults, and for distribution to clubs and groups.</LI>

<LI>Speak out on youth issues about drugs.  Make it a point to
listen to and call-in to radio stations with talk programs that
discuss issues about drugs and related problems among youth. 
Throw your two cents in the barrel.</LI>  

<LI>Influence the airwaves.  Call local radio stations and talk
with the station manager if you object to the music being played.
As a consumer, your opinion can make a difference.</LI>

<LI>Raise community awareness.  Bring information to the attention
of parents, adults and community leaders about problems faced
by youth in the community, e.g. the convenience store that sells
drugs and/or allows underage youth to buy alcohol.  Adults need
to know about what youth face on a day-to-day basis so they can
rally to your support.</LI>

<LI>Promote drug-free youth.  Celebrate and acknowledge the drug-free
lifestyle most youth already practice.  Take your positive stories
to newspapers, radio and TV stations, religious organizations,
and other groups.</LI>     

<LI>Develop teen spokespersons. Organize a teen speakers  bureau.
 Many adult groups and organizations are interested in involving
youth in community prevention programs to help them develop programs
that work.</LI>

<LI>Tap into the creative interests of youth. Solicit the involvement
of teens who are into the arts-dancers,actors, musicians, writers,
and others-to help develop messages, slogans, posters, songs, print ads,
T-shirts, buttons, speeches and articles that promote and address the
benefits of non-use of marijuana and other drugs.</LI> 

<LI>Create positive peer pressure.  Do not engage in any illegal
marijuana or other drug use practices.  Set an example for your
friends and younger brothers and sisters.  Remember, over 86 percent
of youth ages 12-17 have never tried marijuana.</LI>

<LI>Get in the game.  Sports and exercise help reduce the stress
and strain of growing up. They keep you healthy and strong.  When
your mind and body are free from drugs, you have the performance
edge.</LI>

<LI>The art of the matter.  Get involved in drama, music, crafts,
building things, or painting.  You can express your thoughts and
feelings through many different art forms and share them with
the world.  You can grow through your dreams and creativity.</LI>

<LI>Host a party.  Invite your friends to a drug-free social event
and see how much fun you can have without marijuana and drugs.</LI>

<LI>Share what you have learned.  Write an article for your school
newspaper on the facts about marijuana.  You can gather information
from local libraries, or by contacting NCADI at 1-800-729-6686,
or on the Internet, <A HREF="http://www.health.org">http://www.health.org</A>.<br>

<CENTER>
<B>FEMALE ADOLESCENTS AND MARIJUANA USE--Fact Sheet for Adults</B>
</CENTER>

<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="adsfeml.gif">National surveys show that marijuana use by female adolescents
has been increasing:
<UL>
<LI>The 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse shows that
marijuana use among 12- to 17-year-old females has doubled since
1991.</LI>

<LI>The 1994 Monitoring the Future survey showed that marijuana
use by 8th, 10th, and 12th graders rose for the third straight
year.  Daily use by 8th graders doubled.</LI>
 
<LI>The DAWN (Drug Abuse Warning Network) Survey, 1994, revealed
that marijuana/hashish-related emergency room episodes among 12-
to 17-year-olds increased by 50 percent since last year.</LI>

<LI>The Centers for Disease Control report in their 1993 <I>Youth
Risk Behavior Surveys</I> that approximately 7 out of every 25
high school girls have tried marijuana, and approximately 4 out
of 25 are current users.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Marijuana has a definite physical and mental impact:
<UL>
<LI>Marijuana can distort perception and affect short-term memory.</LI>
<LI>Marijuana affects complex motor skills, which can significantly
impair performance, including driving ability.  Car crashes remain
one of the biggest killers of teenage girls.</LI> 
<LI>Marijuana can impair judgment.  Using poor judgment about
sex can place females at risk for unplanned pregnancies and sexually
transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.</LI>
<LI>Chronic marijuana smoking can lead to impaired lung function,
including symptoms of bronchitis and increased susceptibility
to illness and infection.</LI> 
</UL></P>

<P>Female adolescents who become chronic marijuana smokers face a
greater risk of:
<UL>
<LI>lung cancer</LI>
<LI>raised testosterone levels, which can result in increased
facial and body hair and acne</LI>
<LI>increased risk of infertility</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Marijuana use can impair memory, learning, and motivation.  Young
women who use marijuana regularly report that they are unable
to maintain satisfactory grades and performance levels.  With
chronic marijuana use, a girl's ambitions and dreams can go up
in smoke.</P>

<P>Preteen to young adolescence represents a particularly vulnerable
age for females, a time when values and attitudes are formed and
self-esteem is either strengthened or weakened.  Girls aged 9
to 14, in transition from childhood to adulthood, are especially
susceptible to social and environmental influences.  Peer pressure--the
&quot;everybody's-doing-it&quot; syndrome--and the pervasiveness
of pop culture icons that contain pro-marijuana messages can influence
girls to use this drug before they ever understand its consequences.</P>

<H3>10 Things Every Teen Should Know About Marijuana</H3>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="2girls.gif">

<OL>

<LI>Marijuana is illegal.  Using, holding, buying, or selling marijuana can get you
     suspended or expelled from school.  This will hurt your chances of getting a job in the
     future.</LI>

<LI>Resist peer pressure.  Marijuana may make you feel part of the crowd for a while -- but
     who needs friends who could self destruct at any moment?</LI>

<LI> Keep on the right track.  Marijuana reduces your ability to do things that require
     coordination and concentration, like sports, dancing, acting, and studying.</LI>  

<LI>Think twice about what you are advertising.  Do you want to promote something that
     can cause cancer?  make you forget things?  or make it difficult to drive a car?  Think
     about what you're doing if you wear T-shirts, hats, pins, or jewelry with a pot
     leaf/joint/blunt on them.</LI>

<LI>Do the right thing.  Using marijuana hurts your education, family ties, and social life.

<LI>It's a risky business.  Marijuana interferes with your thinking and judgment.  Sexually
     transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, violence and car crashes are all possibilities
     when you use marijuana.</LI>

<LI>Get with the program.  Contrary to what you might hear in songs or see on TV or in
     the movies, smoking marijuana does not make you cool.</LI>

<LI>You can get hooked.  Many users report that, over time, they require more of the drug
     to get the same effect.</LI>

<LI>Talk about your problems.  Using marijuana won't help you escape your problems, it
     will only create more.  Don't believe people who say that marijuana is no big deal, or
     that it will make your life better.</LI>

<LI>You don't need it.  If you think "everybody's doing it" you're wrong  -- over 86 percent
     of 12-17 year olds have never even tried marijuana.  Marijuana won't make you happy
     or popular or help you learn the skills you need as you grow up.  You can do that with
     the help of friends, family, and other adults you trust.</LI>

<H1>Tips for Teens - Marijuana </H1>
<HR>

</CENTER>

<P>Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States and tends to be the first illegal drug teens use.  According to a 1992 survey of high school seniors, 22% had smoked marijuana sometime within the past year.  Marijuana has several negative physical and mental effects.  Use of marijuana may impair or reduce short-term memory and comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to perform tasks requiring concentration and coordination, such as driving a car.  The physical effects, particularly on developing adolescents, can be far more acute.  Studies have shown that marijuana use can lower testosterone levels in men.  Testosterone controls hair and beard growth, development of the penis, muscle mass, and voice changes at puberty.  Marijuana use can also lower sperm counts possible resulting in difficulty having children.  Females who use marijuana can, over time, increase levels of testosterone which can result in increased facial and body hair and acne.  Studies also suggest that chronic use of marijuana may adversely affect reproductive functioning in women.</P>

<h1>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG USE BY<br>
INDIANA CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h1>
<h2>The Indiana Prevention Resource Center Survey - 1995<br>
Prevalence Statistics<br>
<i>Main Findings</i></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

For the past five years, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration - 
Division of Mental Health (formerly the Indiana Department of Mental Health, 
Division of Addiction Services) has contracted with the Indiana Prevention 
Resource Center at Indiana University to coordinate a longitudinal study of 
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use prevalence in Indiana children and 
adolescents.  This survey provides information about the prevalence of ATOD 
use needed for statewide and local planning purposes.  From March 10 through 
April 20, 1995, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center (IPRC) 
coordinated its fifth annual "Alcohol and Other Drug Use Survey", an annual 
survey conducted in the spring of each year in a scientifically designed 
protocol that yields representative statewide data on the prevalence of 
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use by children and adolescents in Indiana. 
<p>
The survey was designed with two purposes in mind: (1) to measure ATOD 
prevalence on a statewide basis for statewide planning and evaluation, and 
(2) to measure ATOD prevalence on a local basis for local planning and 
evaluation purposes.  Since detailed information is required by many local 
communities in order to qualify for federal or state funding, a very large 
number of schools volunteer to participate in the IPRC's survey.  
Although other survey instruments are available to local schools, the IPRC 
survey and its reports are provided to the local communities without charge.  
The widespread participation in the surveys generates a statewide sample that 
is much larger than would be needed simply for statewide planning purposes, 
but is needed in  order to generate meaningful community-level data.  
Most participating schools are scheduled to participate on a biennial or 
triennial basis, but the state's largest school district (with about 10% of 
the total state school population) participates annually to avoid skewing 
the "off-year" results.  
<p>
Data were collected in 85 separate community or school corporation surveys 
conducted in 250  schools throughout Indiana.  These surveys yielded 63,631 
usable surveys.  The school surveys conducted in 1995 provided enough data 
from which to draw inferences about alcohol and other drug use by students in 
grades 6 through 12 throughout the entire state.  In the 1991 survey, 23,319 
usable surveys were collected, in 1992, 20,629 usable surveys were collected, 
in 1993 the number of schools participating increased dramatically, resulting 
in 90,586 usable surveys being collected, and in 1994, 81,732 usable surveys 
were collected.   The 1991 through 1993 surveys included fifth graders, who 
were eliminated in 1994.  The fifth grade samples were more difficult to 
obtain, required working with many more elementary schools, and were much 
less reliable due to a disproportionate number of unusable surveys.  
Since data on fifth graders were not required for statewide planning 
purposes, they were eliminated from the 1994 and future samples.  As data are 
reported by grade, elimination of fifth graders does not influence the 
prevalence rates in grades 6 through 12.  While identical populations were not 
sampled each year, the populations are comparable, were selected for 
geographic and community-size balance in an identical manner, and should 
produce comparable data.
<p>
This year's sample is somewhat smaller than the previous two years samples.  
This is due, in part, to a highly publicized campaign supporting statewide 
legislation to protect student privacy and require parental consent prior to 
student participation in confidential surveys.  Several schools withdrew from 
participation at the last moment, due to publicity about "survey abuse."  
We adjusted our sampling quotas to correct for these last minute defections.  
They do not affect our statewide reliability, but did eliminate important 
local planning information in those affected communities.
<p>
An attempt was made to assure geographic and community-size balance, with an 
appropriate number of schools and subjects selected from each region of the 
state, as well as appropriate sized rural, minority, and urban populations.  
The communities selected for participation are representative of the state, 
at large, in terms of rural/urban and ethnic mix.
<p>
Schools are selected in a three-stage purposive stratified sampling process 
to yield a sample that is representative of the state as a whole.  A 
three-stage purposive/quota cluster sampling procedure is used to yield a 
representative sample of Indiana students that are stratified by grade and 
purposively selected taking into account geographic balance, ethnic diversity, 
and community size.  Schools and communities are purposively selected to 
assure proportional representation from the various parts of the state, 
utilizing ten planning regions established by the Governor's Commission for a 
Drug-Free Indiana, and to assure adequate sampling of minority populations 
and of students from rural areas.  Schools then are assigned a quota designed 
to yield appropriate numbers of subjects in each grade.  
Intact classes are randomly selected as sampling clusters.  The sample 
reasonably well represents the sociodemographic makeup of the state, based 
upon the 1990 decennial Census of Population and Housing.  The 1995 sample 
consisted of appropriate subsamples from each of the ten planning regions.
The number of African-American respondents and Hispanic respondents also well 
represented their share of the state's population.  Although not true random 
sampling, the sampling procedure used in this study is comparable to that 
used in the National High School Survey (Monitoring the Future study) (Johnston, 
<i>et al.</i>, 1993), and its massive size (65,000+ participants) and 
representativeness make it a valuable and reliable sample of the population.

<hr>
The anonymous written questionnaire was selected for reasons of data quality, 
cost and time efficiency and effectiveness, and prior experience.   
Self-administered written questionnaires "were found to produce more complete 
reporting of drug use...[particularly] for reporting of more recent use of 
'harder' drugs." (Schober, <i>et al.</i>., 1992).  This method is 
comparatively less expensive than other data collection methods, and is 
feasible with school-aged youth, given the relatively easy access to this 
population through administration in school settings.  With Indiana's 
relatively strict enforcement of mandatory school attendance laws, more 
than 98% of the youth population under age 16 may effectively be reached 
through school-administered surveys.  School drop-out is a significant 
problem after age 16, and these data reflect only <b>those students still in 
school.</b>  Johnston, <i>et al.,</i> (1993) describe a protocol that can 
be used to estimate the total prevalence (including the drop-out population) 
from data such as these.

<h2>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG USE BY<br>
INDIANA CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
<p>
<b>Prevalence</b> in defined as the rate of "total cases" of a health problem.  
Prevalence rates of drug use are traditionally reported as percentages of all 
drug use over a particular time frame in the entire population at risk.  
This survey uses several different measures of prevalence:
<p>
<b>Lifetime prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade 
or age group that reports using a particular drug at least once in their 
lifetime.
<p>
<b>Annual prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade 
or age group that reports using a particular drug at least once during the 
year prior to the administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Current Use or Monthly prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in 
an entire grade or age group that reports using a particular drug at least 
once in the 30 days prior to the administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Binge drinking</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade or 
age group that reports drinking at least five alcoholic drinks at a sitting 
(approximately the amount needed to raise a person's blood alcohol level to 
about 0.10%) in the 2 weeks prior to administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Daily prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade or 
age group that reports using a particular drug an average of once per day 
during the 30 day period prior to the administration of the survey.  [This 
rate is inferred from the frequency response to a question about monthly 
prevalence, which is the same technique used in the two national surveys used 
for comparison purposes.]
<p>

<h3>PURPOSE AND RATIONALE</h3>

This survey was funded by the Indiana Family and Social Services 
Administration - Division of Mental Health, in order to provide a means of 
meeting the needs of both state and local alcohol and other drug professionals 
for information regarding the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use 
among the population of Indiana. There are several 
needs of both community and state which are met by this survey.  This survey 
allows Indiana to meet federally mandated guidelines for the allocation and 
expenditures of funds for drug abuse programs.  The most efficient allocation 
of resources requires accurate information about the extent of alcohol and 
other drug use.
<p>
An accurate assessment of local needs is a major step in designing and 
implementing alcohol and other drug programs for individual communities. This 
survey allows local professionals to assess the need for programs and to meet 
the requirements of funding agencies for an accurate assessment of the extent 
of the local need.  An accurate and comprehensive cross-sectional survey of 
the prevalence of alcohol and other drug use had not recently been conducted 
in Indiana, prior to the PRC's 1991 survey.  The studies that had been 
conducted were largely independent, localized efforts that yielded specific 
information about individual communities.  Some of these studies were not 
conducted by qualified survey researchers, nor were the instruments 
tested for validity and reliability. Other studies were conducted by private 
organizations, often at great expense to the community.                    
<p>
This survey began a useful statewide data base of information about the 
prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use in Indiana.  The 
individual surveys conducted as a part of this survey provide local 
communities with specific information needed by them to assess local 
needs.  Since all of the local surveys were conducted using the same 
protocols and same instruments, and since these protocols and instruments 
yield data that is directly comparable to two major national surveys, valid 
comparisons can be made and reasoned inferences can be drawn from those 
comparisons.
<p>
<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>

The survey instrument is a four-page self-contained questionnaire developed 
by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center in 1991.  Items are based upon the 
questionnaires developed for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA, 1993) and for the National Institute on Drug Abuse's "Monitoring the 
Future" National High School Survey (Johnston, <i>et al.</i>, 1991, 1992, 
and 1993), and all of the drug use-related items on the questionnaire are 
directly comparable to items on the national surveys.  Items were selected 
for their value in providing statewide planning data and for comparability 
with national data. Items were constructed to yield data to measure progress 
toward meeting the national health objectives set out in <i>Healthy People 2000.</i>   
All of the items were closed-ended questions, 
including three demographic questions, a six-digit school code that provides 
geographic information, and a series of Likert-type items, arranged in 
subscales, to measure:
<ul>
<li> the incidence and prevalence of cigarette smoking, 
<li> the incidence and prevalence of alcohol, smokeless tobacco, and other 
drug use, 
<li> adverse consequences due to alcohol and other drug use experienced by 
the respondent students, 
<li> perceived risks of using alcohol and other drugs, and 
<li> perceived peer approval/disapproval of the student's alcohol and 
other drug use.
</ul>

In 1995, additional subscales were added to measure:
<ul>
<li> perceived alcohol and other drug treatment needs for children and 
adolescents in Indiana,
<li> safety concerns, violence, and weapons use, and
<li> participation in structured and unstructured recreational and informal 
educational activities.  
</ul>
<p>
This report describes only the responses to the alcohol tobacco, and other 
drug use prevalence questions.  Additional monographs in this series will 
report on the treatment needs; safety, violence, and weapons use; and 
participation in youth activities questions.
<p>
The questionnaire was designed to offer consistency of measurements over 
time, provide statistics that were comparable to nationally-conducted drug 
use surveys, and for ease of use and simplicity.  Therefore, the results can 
be plainly presented in an easily understood format, and the results from 
Indiana can be compared with those from national surveys.  The questionnaire 
is intended for use over several samplings.  There are several benefits to 
this strategy:
<p>
First, it provides for the construction of a large data base. The larger a 
data base, the more inherently accurate and valid the collected data will be.
<p>
Second, the more accurate the Indiana data are, the more accurate the 
comparisons between Indiana data and other national data (as the national 
surveys have collected data from tens of thousands of subjects).
<p>
Third, since the data are comparable both through the structure of the 
questionnaire and the times the questionnaires are administered, any changes 
will more accurately reflect actual changes in the use of the drugs examined. 
These changes can reflect upon various prevention strategies, through pre- 
and  post-testing. For example, if the survey were administered at a school 
before that school begins a new prevention program and then surveyed again 
after the program has been implemented, then subsequent changes 
in the results of the two surveys can better be attributed to that program. 
<p>
During development of the survey, the basic questionnaire was reviewed by a 
panel of experts for content validity, subjected to 6 months of pilot testing 
and review by focus groups of school-aged youth, and tested for reliability 
using the test-retest method (correlation coefficient 0.82).  A SMOG Index of 
Readability was calculated to assure readability at the 5th grade level.  
The survey form is optically scannable, allowing for direct transfer of data 
from the forms to a computer file, utilizing an NCS Op-Scan 10 reader.  
The collected data are analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques, 
and multiple regression through SPSS-X routines operating in a VAX/VMS 
environment.  
<p>
The questionnaire used in this survey was designed by the Indiana Prevention 
Resource Center for use in school settings. All of the questions are 
comparable to both the National High School Survey (conducted by the 
University of Michigan) and the National Household Survey (conducted by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse), which show drug use rates for high 
school 8th, 10th and 12th graders, and for persons aged 12 and over, 
respectively. 
<p>
The basic portion of each questionnaire is divided into sixteen multi-part 
questions.  [See Appendix B for copy of the questionnaire.]   Items were 
selected to gather data comparable to the <i>Healthy People 2000</i> standards 
utilized by the U.S. Public Health Service, with the intention of producing 
data that could be used to assess the state's and a community's success 
at meeting the <i>Healthy People 2000</i> target goals.  Since these goals 
often are the basis for evaluation specified in federal and state grant 
funding announcements, the data will assist Indiana applicants in securing 
such funding.
<p>
As in the previous four surveys conducted by the Indiana Prevention Resource 
Center, all surveys were conducted during a six week period in the Spring so 
that the high school data would be comparable to the National High School 
Survey data.  Further surveys will be conducted during the same time period 
each year, in order to yield consistently valid and reliable results.  
Due to the relatively high rates of new drug experimentation during a 
particular school year, it is necessary to survey all populations at about the 
same time, to avoid "maturation bias."  For example, results of a survey 
conducted in one population in September would not be comparable to results 
of a survey conducted in another population in April because many more 
students may have tried drugs for the first time during the intervening seven months.
<p>
Students complete the questionnaire in private, and anonymously deposit it 
in a collection box or envelope to protect confidentiality.  No identifying 
data are collected, except gender, grade in school, and ethnic background, 
and data are processed by a statistical team that has no direct access to 
the students, to assure anonymity.  Students are given the option of 
declining to participate, or of turning in a blank survey instrument.  More 
than 95% of eligible students complete usable surveys at every site.  
Data collection is supervised by the classroom teachers or a classroom 
monitor provided by the local school, in each school.  A 12-minute 
training videotape and written instructions are provided to all data 
collectors, to assure consistent collection of data.  Each school has a 
school coordinator who is personally trained by the IPRC, and who coordinates 
and trouble-shoots data collection at the schools.  IPRC survey 
staff are available via a toll-free 800-number telephone on all data 
collection days, in the event of questions or problems.
<p>
As a check on self reporting accuracy, students are asked how truthfully they 
had answered the questions.  In 1995, over 96% responded completely 
truthfully, 3% responded mostly truthfully, and less than 1% responded not 
truthfully at all.  Focus groups of students during the 1991 pilot test stage 
reported using the "mostly truthfully" option when they intended to answer 
all items truthfully but were uncertain about the answer to a small number of 
items, such as the inability to recall exact dates or numbers of drug use 
episodes.  An error checking protocol was used to eliminate a small number of 
surveys that fell into three categories: (1) those in which the student 
replied that he/she had responded "not truthfully at all," (2) those with 
more than two inconsistent responses that suggested a random 
pattern of answers (ie. students who report "never used" a particular in 
their lifetime, but then report use of that same drug in the past year or 
past month), and (3) pharmacologic implausibility (ie. students 
who report such excessive use of multiple drugs as to create a cumulative 
effect that would be lethal).  These precautions eliminated surveys that were 
not completed seriously by the respondents.  The protocols are consistent 
with recommended protocols to improve validity of self-reports of drug use 
recommended by an advisory panel on validity issues convened by the                    
National Institute on Drug Abuse. (Rouse Kozel & Richards, 1985).
<p>
To substantiate the consistency of the self reports on the current survey, 
in 1992 a correlation coefficient of the reported use of various drugs on a 
five-point Likert scale was calculated comparing reported levels of use in 
the past year with use in the past month.  The correlation coefficient was 
calculated at +0.83, which was statistically significant at p<.01.
<p>
The perceived risk component consisted of a seven-item belief subscale 
related to perceived risk of physical or other harm from drug use.  The items 
were placed on a four point Likert format ranging from "no risk" to "great 
risk."  This subscale was found to be internally consistent with an alpha 
reliability coefficient of 0.85.  Reported frequency of episodes of 
adverse consequences of the use of alcohol and other drugs was measured on a 
ten-item Likert-type scale asking students to report the frequency of 
use-related events such as hangovers, missed school, or poor performance on a 
test.  This subscale also was found to be internally consistent with an 
alpha reliability coefficient of 0.90.  The subscale on perceived peer 
approval/disapproval consisted of seven items with approve/disapprove 
alternatives.  The items in this subscale were internally consistent with an 
alpha reliability coefficient of 0.82.  
<p>
The instruments were designed to produce data that are comparable with that 
produced by two national surveys: the "National High School Survey" and the 
"National Household Survey."  
<p>
The "National High School Survey," also known as the <i>Monitoring the Future</i>
Survey has been administered every year since 1975 to between 15,000 and 
18,000 graduating high school seniors annually from approximately 150 high 
schools nationwide. Beginning with 1991, this survey also gathered limited 
data from 8th and 10th grade students in the same school corporations.  It is 
administered through the University of Michigan's Institute for 
Social Research on behalf of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
The results used in this report's comparisons are those from approximately 
17,000 seniors nationwide constituting the graduating class of 1994, as well 
as preliminary data from approximately 18,800 8th graders 
and approximately 15,500 10th graders in the 1994 national surveys, 
the latest national data available.  
<p>
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse has been conducted every two to 
three years since 1972 directly by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  
The results from the 1990 survey were compared with the 1991 Indiana survey.  
The 1992 household survey is the eleventh study in a series of studies aimed 
at determining drug use rates among the American household population aged 
12 and over.  Only the results from those respondents ages 12 to 17 
were used in comparisons with Indiana students in grades 6 to 11.
<p>
<h4>Limitations and Possible Sources of Error</h4>

As in all surveys, the possibility of errors and the limitations of the 
survey, its instrument, and the manner in which it is distributed, must be 
taken into account when interpreting a survey's results. The following 
limitations are possible sources of such errors in regard to this survey:
<p>
<b>Nonsampling errors</b> = those errors which are the result(s) of recording 
mistakes (respondents marking the wrong answer, ie. doesn't actually apply to 
them), coding errors (the machine skips or misreads a response), missing data 
(some respondents don't answer all the questions), and differences in 
respondents' interpretations of the  questions and answers. These were 
minimized for this survey by a pre-testing conducted at Indiana University, 
specialized training of people who administered the survey, 
coding checks when completed questionnaires were scanned, and checks of 
quality control.  Where the survey team suspects nonsampling errors, these 
have been noted in this report.  
<p>
<b>Sampling errors</b> = those errors that occur from the way in which the 
respondents are chosen and populations are targeted. In other words, the 
reported current use of a particular drug may vary slightly from one sample 
to the next, because of the natural differences which exist in people, their 
location, social practices, etc. and the manner in which they are chosen to 
participate in the survey.  For example, people in the far southern end of 
the state may have slightly different use rates of particular drugs than 
people in the extreme northwest corner of the state, and the state-wide 
results may not reflect an accurate picture of the drug use rates throughout 
the state if disproportionate numbers of people are sampled in the south 
relative to the northwest portion of the state.  These errors were minimized 
by allocating the number of sites in each of the 10 geographic regions used 
by the Governor's Commission for A Drug-Free Indiana and by setting a minimum 
of 50 respondents and a maximum of 2,500 respondents at each site.  
<p>
Scientists use statistical formulas to calculate an estimate of the amount of 
sampling error.  Hundreds of such estimates would have to be made for this 
report, based upon the exact number of responses in each cell category.  To 
avoid unnecessary difficulty in reading such reports, it is customary to 
report the <b>average</b> estimate of sampling error, recognizing that the 
error may be larger in cells with very small numbers of respondents.  
<p>
<b>For the youth populations, the average estimate of sampling error for this the 
whole population and for each grade 6 through 12 in this report is less than &#177;1%, 
within a 95% confidence level.  This means that we estimate that if the same 
number of respondents were sampled 100 times, using the same techniques, 
that in 95 or more of the 100 times, the percentages reported would be within 
or 1% of the percentages reported here.</b>
<p>
In addition, the following should be taken into consideration when attempting 
to interpret the results presented in this report:
<ul>
<li> self-reporting depends on accuracy of memory and honesty in answering 
questions. 

<li> the sample from the National Household Survey used to compare grades 
6 to 11 in Appendix A was relatively small (2,177) compared to the Indiana 
sample of more than 63,000 for the same age group.

<li> those people surveyed were the ones who attended school or work on the 
day on which the survey was conducted at their location. It does not 
(nor does the National High School Survey) sample absentees or school 
dropouts, nor was it a compulsory survey.   Participation in all three 
surveys was strictly voluntary.

<li> the National Household Survey uses a "household interview" technique 
that relies upon oral responses to questions posed by an interviewer.  
This technique may produce results that are not directly comparable to the 
"anonymous written questionnaire" techniques utilized by the PRC survey and 
by the National High School Senior Survey.
</ul>

<h2>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG USE BY<br>
INDIANA CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<h3>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 1995 FINDINGS</h3>

<b>NOTE TO READERS:</b>
<p>
In the tables and graphs found in the next section, the prevalence data 
reported herein are compared with data from a national survey conducted in 
1994 (and annually since 1975) -- the National High School Survey, also known 
as the <i>Monitoring the Future</i> Study, which is 
used as the standard of comparison for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.  In 
Appendix A, the data also are compared with the National Household Survey - 
1988 and 1990, which were used to establish certain target objectives for the 
year 2000 in <i>Healthy People 2000:  Health Objectives 
for the Nation.</i>  The National Household Survey reports only a pooled 
statistic for ages 12 through 17 and is used as a standard of comparison for 
grades 6 through 11.  It is important to note that the latest Indiana data 
are for 1995, and the most recent national comparison standards are from 1994 
and previous years.  Since drug use prevalence trends vary from time to 
time, this difference in data collection time frame should be taken into 
account when interpreting these data.  <b>At press time for this report, 
tobacco use data from the 1994 national survey had not yet been released, so 
that charts and tables reflect a comparison with national data 
on tobacco use through 1993.</b>
<p>
The most useful picture of adolescent use of alcohol, tobacco, and other 
drugs will be found by examining data for <b>high school seniors.</b>  The 
data on seniors shows the full extent of use and best describes the use of 
drugs by older adolescents.  Data on younger students become less and less 
relevant for the total picture as age drops, but are useful in describing 
patterns of use at a particular age and in planning age- or grade-appropriate 
prevention programs.
<p>
<b>NOTE TO NON-INDIANA READERS:</b>
<p>
In various places in this report, we use the term "Hoosier" to describe a 
resident of or attribute of the State of Indiana.  This is accepted local 
usage.  Hoosier means "of Indiana" and is not just descriptive of residence 
-- it is a way of life.  The term "Indianian" is <b>never</b> used in 
the State of Indiana.
<blockquote>
<i>"I insist that the Hoosier is different mentally and spiritually to the 
average person.  He is softer, less sophisticated, more poetic and romantic.  
He dreams a lot.  He likes to play in simple ways.  He is not as grasping as 
some other Americans.  In a crude way, perhaps, he has the temperament of the 
artist, and so I still look to Indiana and its children, at least, 
to do great things..."</i><p>
Theodore Dreiser in <i>The Nation</i>
</blockquote>

<h3>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h3>
Three years of morale-breaking cutbacks in federal appropriations for 
school-based drug prevention programs, and the resulting devastation in 
school-based programming levels and prevention staff layoffs are taking their 
toll on Hoosier children and adolescents.  For the third straight year, 
significant increases in marijuana use have been noted.  The significant 
progress we observed in national statistics from 1980 through 1992  and in 
Indiana statistics from 1991 through 1992 has stopped.  Indiana students 
report increased use of cigarettes, marijuana, inhalants, and most other 
drugs between 1993 and 1995.  Significant findings from the 1995 survey 
include:
<ul>
<li> The increased use of marijuana by Hoosier children and adolescents that 
we reported the last two years, continued unabated in 1995.  All measures of 
prevalence (lifetime, annual, monthly, and daily) increased again this year 
at all grade levels.  This trend was also reported for 1994 by the National 
High School Survey (Johnston, et al., 1994), by the PRIDE National Survey, 
and for Marion County, Indiana by Project I-STAR.  For high school seniors, 
lifetime use increased from 31.0% in 1992 to 40.0% in 1995, annual use 
increased from 23.7% to 34.6% between 1992 and 1995, monthly 
use increased from 14.4% to 24.0%, and daily use increased from 3.9% to 7.4%, 
again from 1992 to 1995.  Nationally, the upswing in marijuana use in 1993 
that reversed a 14-year decline in use from 1978 to 1992, continued in 1994. 
Positive references to marijuana use continued to increase in popular music, 
films, and other media.

<li> Daily, monthly, annual, and lifetime cigarette smoking increased at most 
grades, which for the second consecutive year reversed the decline among 
Hoosier students that we reported in 1992 and 1993.  This increase mirrors 
the increase reported the last two years by the National High School Survey.  
The increase in cigarette smoking is particularly worrisome, since daily 
cigarette smoking is the best statistical predictor of future 
use of alcohol and other drugs (Torabi, Bailey, and Majd-Jabbari, 1993).  
Among children and adolescents, daily smokers are three times more likely to 
drink heavily and ten to sixty times more likely to use controlled substances 
as are non-smokers.

<li> The one bright spot in the 1995 findings is binge drinking (consumption 
of five or more drinks on a single occasion at least once in the two weeks 
prior to survey), which continues to decline slowly. Binge drinking rates for 
1995 were the lowest reported since 1991, and show a significant decline over 
the five year period.  The rates still exceed national levels, however. 

<li> On the other hand, use of psychedelic drugs (particularly LSD, but also 
including mescaline, psilocybin, ecstasy, and others) increased abruptly in 
1995.  Monthly use by high school seniors showed a dramatic increase from 4.4% 
in 1994 to 8.2% in 1995.  Significant increases were observed in grades 10 
through 12.  We noted this level of increase in a handful of local community 
surveys in 1994 -- the trend apparently has gone statewide in 1995.  

<li> Another area of concern is an apparent disproportionately high rate of 
use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, inhalants, tranquilizers, and 
narcotics that we reported last year among members of the high school class 
of 1997 (now 10th graders in 1994).  The National High School Survey 
(Johnston, et al., 1994) and the American Alcohol and Drug Survey (Edwards, 
1993) both reported increases in drug use by 8th graders in 1993.  We have 
observe a dramatic increase in illegal drug use by members of this 
same class cohort.  It is too early to determine if the use rates for this 
high school class are an anomaly, or are a predictor of future problems among 
members of this and subsequent 10th grade classes.

<li> Use of inhalant drugs (nitrous oxide, volatile nitrites, and 
petroleum-based solvents) also appears to be on the increase.  Lifetime, 
annual, and monthly use increased in almost all grades -- many at 
statistically significant levels.  Current (monthly) use is at 
its greatest level in 8th grade, and annual use is greatest in 9th grade -- 
both declining in higher grades.  Inhalant use is the only observed form of 
drug use that peaked in the middle grades and then declined.  Use of all 
other drugs increases year-by-year.

<li> Hoosier students in grades 6 through 12 still maintain their much 
higher-than-national rates of illegal use of prescription drugs.  Use of 
amphetamines, tranquilizers, and prescription narcotics by Indiana children 
and adolescents are at rates two to six times higher than reported in the 
national surveys.  The national rates dropped dramatically  during the 1980's 
-- Indiana's present rates are similar to those seen at the national level 
a decade ago.

<li> Early experimentation with cigarettes continues to be a problem, with 
nearly 4% of Hoosier children reporting experimentation with cigarettes by 
age 7, and more than 9% reporting at least some use by age 9.  More than 7% 
of Hoosier students report at least some use of alcohol prior to age 7 and 
more than 12% have used alcohol by age 9.   This early use of the gateway 
drugs of tobacco and alcohol may be a major contributor to Indiana's 
above-the-national average rates of controlled substance use.

<li> As a matter of fact, nearly all of the increases in other drug use 
noted in this survey are closely correlated with the increases in cigarette 
use over the same time frame.  If the cigarette smoking rates are 
artificially adjusted to hold them constant, use of other drugs also remains 
essentially unchanged.  This suggests that nearly all of the increase 
in other drug use is occurring in the increasingly larger pool of students 
who choose to smoke cigarettes.

<li> As reported last year, for all drugs, use by males exceeded use by 
females.  Surprisingly, however, there still was significant use of smokeless 
tobacco and anabolic steroids by female students, despite the fact that these 
drugs are often assumed by the public to be "male drugs."  More than 10% of 
female juniors and seniors report some use of smokeless tobacco.

STUDENT USE OF MOST DRUGS REACHES HIGHEST LEVEL IN NINE YEARS<br>
</font>
More report getting "very high, bombed, or stoned"

<p>
	Washington, Sept. 25 - More than one in four high school seniors (26.5%) used an illicit drug once a month or more often during the past school year, and when they used drugs they got more intoxicated than ever.
<P>
	Nearly one in five 12th graders (18.3%) used an illicit drug weekly or more.
<p>
	Almost one in ten (8.4%) used daily.
<p>
	More than a quarter admitted weekly alcohol use (25.8%). In addition, 7.1% used cocaine in the past year; 11.6% used uppers; 12.1% used hallucinogens, and 3.5% used heroin.
<p>
	In its ninth annual survey of students in grades 6-12, PRIDE (National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education) reported that annual use of most drugs was at the highest level since the survey began in 1987-88. Record percentages of use were reported for the following drug categories: cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, uppers, downers, inhalants, and hallucinogens.
<p>
	Only three drug categories have ever shown higher levels of use in the PRIDE Survey: beer, wine coolers, and liquor. (Heroin was added as a drug category in 1995-96.)
<p>
Overall, for grades 6-12, PRIDE found that 29.5% of all students surveyed reported annual use of at least one illicit drug, compared with 18.6% in 1987-88, an increase of 58.6%.
<p>
	Annual use of any illicit drug increased from 24.0% in 1994-95 to 29.5% 1995-96, a one-year increase of 22.9%.
<p>
	On a monthly basis, use of any illicit drug by students in grades 6-12 rose from 10.6% in 1987-88 to 18.3% in 1995-96, an increase of 72.6%.
<p>

FEWER STUDENTS THAN EVER SAY PARENTS WARN THEM
<p>
	Despite these alarming statistics, the percentage of students who said their parents talk to them often or a lot about the problems of alcohol and other drugs plunged to the lowest level in the six years that the question has appeared on the survey instrument (29.6% in 1995-96 vs. 40.3% in 1990-91, a drop of 26.6%).
<p>
	Nor are students receiving drug warnings from their peers. Only 11.7% said their friends talk to them regularly about the problems of drugs, compared to 10.7% in 1990-91, a slight improvement.
<p>
	By contrast, 88.9% said their teachers have taught them about drug dangers.
<p>
	When parents warn their children about drugs, use is lower. For example, among students who said they never hear from their parents on the subject of drugs, 35.5% reported using an illicit drug in the past year. That number fell to 26.6% for those whose parents spoke "a lot."
<p>

SCHOOLS ARE LEAST LIKELY PLACE OF DRUG USE
<p>
	Compounding the problem that fewer parents talk to their children about drugs than before, is the fact that most drug use occurs when and where parents are in charge.
<p>
	Among five choices (home, friend's home, car, other place, and school), students said a school building is the last place they use drugs. For example, among 6-12th graders, 16.8% said they smoked marijuana at a friend's home, 13.9% said they smoked at some other place in the community; 10.3% said they smoked in a car; 8.2% said in their own home; and 4.2% said in school.
<p>
	Students said they used drugs mostly at night and on weekends, again when parents are in charge.
<p>
	"Students are getting more guidance about drugs from their teachers than from their parents and friends, and they are using drugs far more often at home, in cars, and at places in the community other than schools. School is the most drug-preventive, drug-free place in town," said Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE.
<p>

WHEN THEY USE, STUDENTS ARE GETTING HIGHER THAN EVER
<p>
	Besides more students using drugs more frequently, more students in 1995-96 reported getting "very high, bombed, or stoned" when they used drugs. Nearly three-fourths of seniors (73.6%) said they get very high when they smoke marijuana, versus 62.8% who responded the same way in 1987-88.
<p>
	Users of beer, cocaine, uppers, inhalants, and hallucinogens also said they were getting higher today than nine years ago.
<p>
	"This is not so-called 'recreational' use. This is marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and amphetamines. This is not experimentation. This is monthly, weekly, and daily use. This is a human tragedy," said Doug Hall, executive director of PRIDE.
<p>
	Today's report marks the fifth straight year of rising drug use reported by PRIDE. The PRIDE Survey has been reported annually since the 1987-88 school year.
<p>
	The responses of 129,560 students in 26 states from New York to California were included in the survey, making it the largest student survey in the nation, and the first to report drug use for the 1995-96 school year.
<p>

MARIJUANA USERS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN OTHER DRUGS
<p>
	Among all students studied 29.5% said they used an illicit drug in the past year, and 24.8% said they smoked marijuana. However, most marijuana users in the study also drank alcohol, and used other dangerous drugs at very high rates
<p>
	Among monthly marijuana users, 69% also drank liquor monthly versus 7.4% of non-marijuana users; 13% used cocaine monthly versus one-tenth of a percent of non-users; and 19% used hallucinogens monthly versus two-tenths of a percent for non-users.
<p>
	In the past year, the sharpest increase came in junior high marijuana use (grades 6-8) which rose from 9.5% annual use in 1994-95 to 13.6% in 1995-96, a 43% increase. Nearly a tenth of the junior high (8.1%) said they used marijuana on a monthly basis or more, up from 5.7% in the previous year.
<p>
	Among high school students (grades 9-12), marijuana annual use climbed from 28.2% to 34%, a 20.6% increase. One out of five in high school (22.3%) smoked monthly or more, versus 18.5% the year before.
<p>
	Use was highest in the senior class with 37.9% smoking marijuana on an annual basis, 24.3% monthly or more, 16.6% weekly or more, and 7.3% daily.
<p>
	"One stunning consequence of marijuana use is that a fifth of the Class of '96 who smoke marijuana weekly will find it difficult, if not impossible, to pass a pre-employment drug test," Hall said. "And that says nothing about the negative health consequences of this drug use."
<p>
	One reason for rising marijuana use may be a lack of belief by students that marijuana is harmful to their health. Among sixth graders, 85.5% said marijuana was "very harmful" to their health. But among 12th graders, only 43.6% said the same.
<p>
	Students also found marijuana easy to obtain, with 73.3% of 12th graders saying it is easy to get.
<p>

CIGARETTE USE AT NINE-YEAR HIGH
<p>
	Nearly a half of all students in grades 9-12 smoked cigarettes in the past year (48.2%) and a third of them smoked monthly or more often (33.4%). That compares with 36.1% who used annually in 1987-88, a 33.5% increase, and 23.6% who smoked monthly, a 41.5% increase.
<p>
	Daily smoking in grades 9-12 rose from 12.3% in 1987-88 to 18.4% in 1995-96, a 49.6% increase.
<p>

MIXED SUCCESS IN CURBING TEEN VIOLENCE
<p>
	The percentage of students who said they carried a gun to school last year dropped slightly (from 4.9% the year before to 4.5%) as did the percentage saying they joined a gang (from 13.8% to 12.4%).
<p>
	However, the number who said they threatened to harm someone rose (from 31.8% to 42.1%) as did the percentage of those who got in trouble with the police (from 24.7% to 25.2%).
<p>
	Drug use was more common among students who carried a gun to school, joined a gang, got in trouble with the police, or experienced other negative behaviors. (See attachment.)
<p>

METHODOLOGY
<p>
	The study was conducted during the 1995-96 school year and involved 129,560 students from 26 states. The PRIDE Survey represents data from sixth through twelfth grade students conducted between September and June of the school year. Participating schools are sent the PRIDE Questionnaire with explicit instructions for administering the anonymous, self report instrument.
<p>
	Schools that administer the PRIDE Questionnaire do so voluntarily, or in compliance with a school district or state request.
<p>
	The PRIDE Survey is consistent with other national studies, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Monitoring the Future Survey. Information from the PRIDE Survey is found in the President's National Drug Control Strategy and the Bureau of Justice Statistics Sourcebook. It is also used by the United States Congress as an indicator of student drug use.
<p>
	Results from the 1995-96 PRIDE Survey were announced at a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington. Participating were Thomas J. Gleaton, Ed.D., president of PRIDE, and co-author of the survey, J. Douglas Hall, executive director of PRIDE, and Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey (Ret.), director of the Office of National Drug Control Strategy.
<p>
States represented in the 1995-96 PRIDE Survey: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. <p>

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>

<P>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<HR>

<P>
Citizen input, using a consensus-building process, was extensively
utilized to build this report. Six events, two state-wide and
four regional, provided opportunities for field experts, volunteers,
local officials, and advocates to shape the report's contents.
<P>
The report is an accumulation of the problem statements and recommended
actions that were most strongly and consistently supported throughout
the public input phase. As each input session was concluded, a
record of the proceedings was evaluated and used to edit a &quot;rolling
document,&quot; which ultimately provided the bulk of the material
for the report.
<P>
Following the public input phase, the Commission, aided by members
of the Interagency Council on Drugs, worked over a period of three
months to shape the final report. Commission staff conducted the
research and gathered information to verify the problem statements.
<P>
The report contains eight problem statements. Each one is a statement
of a need for change. In some cases, the problem is identified
as the need for a shift in emphasis. In others, the problem is
an unacceptable level of the consequences of alcohol and other
drug use.
<P>
Following each problem statement is a supportive documentation
section, confirming that the problem statement is valid, accurate,
and clear. Data, research findings, information from state and
local documents, and testimony from the public input forums are
used to support the problem statement.
<P>
Recommended actions are grouped into three categories. They are:
<ul>
<li><b>Legislative</b> - recommendations that call for the State to pass
laws.

<li><b>Administrative</b> - recommendations that should be implemented through
state policy and/or rule.

<li><b>Advocacy</b> - recommendations for positions the State should take
with regard to supporting action by others.
</ul>
Each recommendation has a state agency identified as the &quot;lead  ð 7   3                     Šagency.&quot; This does not imply that the identified agency will
necessarily have the sole responsibility for carrying out the
action. The Commission strongly supports a collaborative approach
in carrying out the responsibilities of state government. The
designation of a lead agency is to identify a specific agency
that is charged with the responsibility to initiate the action
and follow up on progress. A list of the lead agencies is contained
at the end of the report on page 37.
<P>
Following the listing of recommended actions is a brief and general
description of the expected outcomes, should some or all of the
recommendations be implemented. The expected result statements
tie back to the problem statement and identify the areas for measuring
impact.
<P>
Benchmarks are targets for measuring the changes resulting from
actions. Most of the benchmarks will be measurable targets for
each of three years, beginning with 1995. In cases where the data
are not available at this time, the first year will be used to
establish base-line information upon which to build 1996 and 1997
benchmarks.
<P>
Resource development recommendations have been clustered, forming
a separate section of the report. In some cases, the recommended
action will address one or more specific problem statements, while
in others, no assumptions are made with respect to the use of
the additional resources.
<P>
A status report on the problem indicators adopted by the Commission
in 1992 concludes the report. The data, taken collectively provide
a snapshot of the extent and seriousness of problems related to
alcohol and other drug use in Indiana. Many of the indicators
will be found throughout the report as measures of progress in
addressing specific problems.<HR>

<a name="parents">
<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT A</B> <HR>

<P>
<B>There is not enough parent or other significant adult involvement
in alcohol, tobacco, and other drug strategies and services for
youth and families.</B> 
<P>
For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
<P>
<U>Other significant adult</U> - recognizes that all children
are not living with their natural parents but have different family
configurations that need to be considered and included in discussing
&quot;parent involvement.&quot;
<P>
<U>Family focused/centered</U> - programs are community based,
respect cultural differences, and are easily accessible to parents
to be as responsive as possible to the families they serve; ensures
that families are in the forefront of decision-making processes  ð 7   3                     Šthat affect their lives and communities.
<P>
<B>SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION</B> 
<P>
Prevention professionals have identified parent or other significant
adult involvement as a key ingredient in the success of prevention
programs. These adults continue to be the most important role
models and key influences in the lives of their children.
<P>
In the 1993 Governor's Drug Summit II and the 5 public input forums
that followed, more parent involvement in alcohol, tobacco and
other drug services was identified and remained a priority recommendation
by over 800 citizens from around the state. According to these
participants, parents have not been adequately engaged in the
planning, development and implementation of prevention strategies,
programs and services, often passing the responsibility for addressing
and resolving alcohol and other drug problems to schools and other
community institutions. Social service, education, addiction,
law enforcement and other professionals, students and parents
themselves further identified lack of parenting skills, unresponsiveness
of community institutions to the needs of parents, latch key situations
and disjointed family support services as contributing factors
to lack of parent involvement.
<P>
According to representatives from the Judicial system, juvenile
and family court judges have the authority to order parent participation
in court ordered alcohol, tobacco and other drug services for
minor children. While some judges routinely require parent involvement,
this practice varies considerably around the state.
<P>
During the past 4 years, over 60% of the comprehensive community
alcohol, tobacco and other drug plans, developed by Indiana's
92 Local Coordinating Councils, identified a need for more, programs
and services directed at parents and their children, and involving
parents as partners in the development and/or implementation of
programs and services. Further, many of the Step Ahead Councils'
county action plans identified alcohol and other drug abuse as
a problem for children and families, and recommended more family
centered programs to support families in crisis.
<P>
<B>RECOMMENDED ACTIONS</B> 
<P>
<B>ADMINISTRATIVE</B> 
<P>
Al. Identify and disseminate information about strategies that
reduce or eliminate barriers for involving parents or other significant
adults in programs that affect their children and families.
<P>

A3. Advocate for family interventions in schools, criminal justice
agencies, and other social service agencies.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana
<P>
A4. Encourage parent or other significant adult involvement in
the identification, design, development and implementation of
all prevention strategies and programs.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana
<P>
A5. Advocate for state and local collaboration to expand family-focused
community correction alternatives for juvenile offenders.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Corrections
<P>
A6. Work through the Judicial Conference Education Committee to
advocate for early court interventions that involve probation,
schools, families recovering abusers, etc.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Criminal Justice Institute
<P>
<B>EXPECTED RESULTS</B> 
<P>
<B>Parents or other significant adults will become visible and
active partners in alcohol,</B> <B>tobacco and other drug planning
and services. Planners and providers will utilize a more</B> <B>family-centered
approach in alcohol, tobacco and other drug planning and services.</B>

<P>
<B>BENCHMARKS</B> 
<P>
<B>1995</B> Utilizing the Indiana Prevention Resource Center's
annual evaluation of prevention programs, baseline data will be
collected about the extent of parent or other significant adult
involvement in design, development and/or implementation of prevention
programs.
<P>
By September, baseline data will be collected on the number of
Local Coordinating-Councils and Step Ahead Councils whose memberships
are composed of at least 10% parents, or persons acting in the
role of parent, who are not affiliated with service delivery agencies
and organizations.
<P>
The Indiana Criminal Justice Institute will conduct a research
study to determine the number of courts that conduct family interventions
in coordination with other youth-serving/interested agencies and
organizations.  ð 7   3                     Š<P>
The efficacy and the potential for replication of the multi-state
agency demonstration project focused on collaborative community
correction alternatives or juvenile offenders will be evaluated.
<P>
<B>1996</B> Parent or other significant adult involvement in the
design, development and/or implementation of prevention programs
will increase by 10% over the baseline data.
<P>
Parent or other significant adult representation on Local Coordinating
Councils and Step Ahead Councils will increase by at least 15%

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>

<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT B</B> <HR>

<P>
<B>Communication and collaboration between government, private
agencies, and consumers in developing strategies and providing
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug strategies are insufficient.</B>

<P>
<B>SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION</B> 
<P>
State government has initiated several interagency and public/private
collaborations during the past 6 years: the Governor's Commission
for a Drug-Free Indiana (the Commission), Step Ahead: the Indiana
Collaboration Project, and Project ASSIST are among the most visible
efforts. While making progress, State Government lacks a long
history of collaboration, and often continues to operate in ways
that hinder communication and collaboration at the state and local
levels. The design of government clearly identifies responsibility
and does not value sharing as a pattern of behavior.
<P>
Collaboration does not render a &quot;quick fix'' to critical
societal issues. It is instead a slow and intentional process
that requires long-term commitment. Government's shifting priorities
create a time and interest-limited focus on most issues.
<P>
Efforts of the administration to downsize government have intensified
the demand on limited resources within agencies. Without a history
upon which to draw, a clear understanding of the benefits, and
a lack of incentives for cooperation, most agencies view collaboration
as a low priority, when faced with pressures to carry out day-to-day
responsibilities.
<P>
Member agencies of the Interagency Council on Drugs continue to
struggle with the purpose and value of this collaboration model.
Although agency participants increasingly share information and
collaborate, it is difficult for participants to fully embrace
this non-traditional mode of operating and relating, and to advocate
for full agency commitment and involvement.
<P>
According to the Commission's Regional Coordinating Offices, local
partners comment that state planners need to identify existing
efforts of government before developing new community collaboration
initiatives. Not doing this has resulted in multiple organizations
or efforts with duplicative purposes, and limited the ability
of government to provide service and/or support to grassroots
projects.
<P>
Community partners also believe that local level collaborations
are working much better than state efforts and that the lack of
communication and collaboration at the state level limits the
effectiveness of the local agencies to work cooperatively. It
is further believed that there are no practiced policies at the
state level that foster and reward cooperation and collaboration
at the local level.
<P>
Private sector and youth partners have been identified as critically
missing in many local collaborations. Local partners say they
look to government to assist with these linkages. To date, state
government has been unsuccessful in attempts to involve private
sector participation to support local efforts. Although young
people are becoming more visible in local planning and programming
activity, there is minimal activity from state government to facilitate
youth as partners in the collaboration agenda.
<P>

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>

<P>


<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT C</B> <HR>

<P>
<B>There is a continuing demand for alcohol, tobacco, and other
drug products by youth and adults, resulting in individual and
community impairment.</B> 
<P>
<B>SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION</B> 
<P>
In its 1994 Prevalence Statistics Survey, the Indiana Prevention
Resource Center (PRC) reports an increased use of cigarettes,
marijuana, and inhalants by Indiana students. The PRC survey further
states that the rate of binge drinking remains static after a
two year decline, the use of other drugs remains virtually unchanged,
and the illegal use of prescription drugs remains significantly
higher than national usage rates. Early tobacco experimentation
also continues to be a problem.
<P>
According to a 1992 Indiana Department of Health tobacco analysis,
approximately 24% of adult citizens of Indiana smoke and about
3.4% chew tobacco and/or use snuff. Black adults have a higher
rate of use than do hispanics, whites, and adults of other ethnic
populations.
<P>
Among persons 35-64 years of age, Indiana rates well above the
national median for cigarette smoking prevalence according to
a 1990 report authorized by the Office of Smoking and Health,
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
<P>
There were 230 counts of alcohol sales to minors in 1993. Most
notable were: 1) in 55 of those counts, minors used false IDs
to buy alcohol, and 2) fifteen of the violations of sales to minors
were in grocery and drug stores. The State Excise Police point
out that enforcing minor sales laws in grocery and drug stores
is a major problem because of the range of products sold in these
types of outlets. These enforcement difficulties are thought to
result in a lower detection rate of violations in drug and grocery
stores.
<P>
Preliminary results from a survey of Indiana college students
between the ages of 18 and 24, conducted by the Indiana University
Institute for Drug Abuse Prevention, suggest that 48.7% of those
students surveyed possessed false evidence of age to obtain alcohol,
and 40.% used false evidence of age to obtain alcohol.
<P>
When asked about the difficulty for minors to buy alcohol in certain
types of establishments, students responded as follows:
<P>
<U>Easy or Moderate</U> <U>Difficult</U> 
<P>
Package liquor stores 76.2% 23.8%
<P>
Taverns or bars 89.3% 11.7%
<P>
Other restaurants 74.4% 25.6%
<P>
Convenience stores or mini marts 85.9% 14.1%
<P>
Full-service grocery stores 74.4% 25.6%
<P>
Drug Stores 70.1% 29.9%
<P>
In Indiana it is legal for 18-20 year-olds to sell alcohol in
convenience stores, mini marts, grocery stores and drug stores.
71.9% of the students surveyed said it was easier to buy alcohol
from underage clerks: as a minor, 31.5 % had purchased alcohol
from a clerk they believed to be underage, and 56.6% said underage
clerks were less likely to check IDs than clerks who were of legal
drinking age.
<P>
Preliminary results from the 1993 National Household Survey on
Drug Abuse suggest that the downward trend in prevalence of drug
use over the past ten years may have stopped. The data reflect
a leveling off of the prevalence rate and further suggests the
beginning of an upward trend in drug use for all age groups. The
survey also indicates a softening of anti-drug attitudes of youth.
Additionally, the survey reports the persistence of heavy, chronic
use of illegal drugs by the over 35 age group.

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>

<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT D</B> 
<P>
<B>The capacity to treat offenders in state correctional facilities
is inadequate, resulting in long waiting lists for services and
lapses in treatment continuity .</B> 
<P>
SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION
<P>
The Indiana Department of Correction reports that for the year
ending June 30, 1994, the average number of offenders enrolled
in treatment programs per day was 1,920, with an average of 1,574
on waiting lists. The average length of time on a waiting list
was reported to be six to nine months. The factors identified
by DOC that impact upon their ability to meet the identified needs
and successfully treat inmates were:
<UL>
<LI>inadequate numbers of treatment professionals;
<LI>turnover of treatment staff;
<LI>insufficient space in which to conduct programs;
<LI>transfers of inmates between facilities due to capacity limitations;
and
<LI>the number of offenders waiting to be admitted.
</UL>

<P>
Further, DOC officials note that progress made in treatment is
sometimes negated by a breakdown in the continuity of treatment
between institutional and community programming.
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
<P>
LEGISLATIVE
<P>
Dl. Increase state funding to significantly reduce waiting lists.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
ADMINISTRATIVE
<P>
D2. Require that treatment programs for offenders incorporate
family issues.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
D3. Develop more intensive treatment programs for offenders who
are about to be released.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
D4. Increase space allocated in state institutions for treatment
programming.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
D5. Expand opportunities for corrections and community treatment
professionals to interchange ideas on services to offenders.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
D6. Improve DOC treatment personnel salaries to attract more qualified
clinicians.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Correction
<P>
EXPECTED RESULTS
<P>
There will be an increased number of DOC inmates identified as
needing treatment for alcohol and other drug problems who receive
more timely services prior to release. There will be improved
treatment continuity within DOC as well as with post-release treatment
services.
<P>

<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT E</B> 
<P>
<B>The treatment services continuum for youth and adults is inadequate,

<P>
SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION
<P>
The state agency having primary responsibility for assessing the
needs for treatment services in Indiana and implementing a system
of publicly-supported treatment services is the Family and Social
Services Administration, Division of Mental Health (DMH). For
the state fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, the DMH reported that
21,850 persons were admitted to alcohol and other drug treatment
facilities for services supported in whole or part by state and
federal funds. The cost of the services was $38,011,610, or $1,740
per person admitted. The cost to the State of Indiana for each
person admitted was $1,261. The information below compares cost,
state funding, admissions, and state funding per admission data
for the past three years.
<P>
Year Cost State Funding Admissions State cost
<P>
Per Admission
<P>
1990-91 $33,842,544 $27,436,029 22,240 $1,233.63
<P>
1991-92 $36,920,106 $29,860,216 24,127 $1,237.63
<P>
1992-93 $38,011,610 $27,551,383 21,850 $1,260.93
<P>
The F&amp;SSA, Division of Mental Health has not compiled data
on the unmet treatment needs in Indiana nor is there currently
in place a performance monitoring system that includes treatment
outcomes. Beginning this year, the Division is conducting needs
assessment and actuarial studies to determine the state-wide service
needs and, as a part of the state's new mechanism for funding
treatment services, the Hoosier Assurance Plan, treatment outcomes
will be monitored.
<P>
Between July 1993 and July 1994, all ninety-two Indiana Counties
submitted comprehensive local plans to address alcohol and other
drug issues. Many of the counties identified the lack of services
available or accessible to persons needing treatment for an alcohol
or other drug problem. The data on the next page illustrates those
service needs.
<P>
Terms:
<P>
<U>Services for Indigents</U> - The plan specifically identifies
the lack of treatment service capacity for, or accessibility to
services by, low income, uninsured, underinsured, or indigent
residents.
<P>
<U>Services for Children</U> - The plan specifically identifies
the lack of treatment service capacity for, or accessibility to
services by, children and/or adolescent residents.
<P>
<U>One Gap in Service Continuum</U> - The plan contains a reference
to the absence or the inadequacy of one service type or services
for a specific population other than low income children and/or
adolescent residents.
<P>
<U>Two or More Gaps in The Service Continuum</U> - The plan contains
two or more separate references to the absence of service types
or services for specific populations other than low income or
children and/or adolescent residents.
<P>
Several counties reported having lost publicly-supported treatment
services during the past two years. Others cited changes in the
fee collection policies of state-supported providers, including
rate increases and institution of admission charges. Forty-eight
(48) counties reported waiting lists of more than two weeks for
one or more services, with some waiting lists reported as being
up to six weeks.<p>
<center><a href="table1.html"><font size=5>Table 1</a></center></font>
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
<P>
LEGISLATIVE
<P>

expand community corrections treatment programming, and expand
treatment of youthful offenders.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Family &amp; Social Services Administration-Div.

<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana
<P>
EXPECTED RESULTS
<P>
Inclusion of alcohol and other drug treatment services in private
and public health benefits programs will more fully integrate
addictions treatment into the primary health care system and ensure
that more of the basic needs for services will be met. The extent
of coverage will determine the remaining need for states to provide
support for treatment services.
<P>
The other advocacy, legislative, and administrative actions will
result in a more complete continuum of publicly-supported, family-oriented,
treatment services. Services will be provided in a more timely
manner and will have improved outcomes.
<P>
BENCHMARKS
<P>
1995 Fewer than thirty-five counties will report waiting lists
of two weeks or more for state-supported treatment services.

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>


<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT F</B> 
<P>
<B>Continuing high rates of accidents, injuries, and death are
associated with impaired driving.</B> 
<P>
SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION
<P>
According to the Governor's Council on Impaired &amp; Dangerous
Driving, while statistics indicate that great strides have been
made to reduce the number of deaths and injuries which result
from alcohol-related crashes, driving under the influence of alcohol
or other drugs still presents a significant problem in Indiana.
<P>
In Indiana in 1993, there were 199 fatal alcohol-related crashes,
resulting in 228 fatalities and 4,807 personal injury crashes,
resulting in 7,144 injuries.
<P>
1992 Indiana FARS (Fatal Accident Reporting System) data indicates
that 35% of the drivers killed in crashes had BAC levels greater
than zero, while 32% had BAC levels over 0.05%. Drivers in the
25 to 34 age group had the highest percentage (52%) of alcohol-related
fatalities. Of younger drivers (24 years old or less), 35% killed
in crashes tested above zero, accounting for 29% of the fatalities
among drivers. Given the fact that this age group accounts for
only 15.8% of licensed drivers, drunk driving among youth is actually
a bigger problem than it may first appear.
<P>
The number of impaired driving arrests in Indiana decreased from
41,070 in 1991 to 38,244 in 1992. While there are many factors
to which this could be attributed, the Governor's Council on Impaired
and Dangerous Driving indicates that reductions in training funds,
overtime enforcement grants, police manpower, and equipment have
combined to bring about this decrease in arrests.
<P>
Another problem relating to impaired driving is the public's perception
of their chances of being caught. According to a 1993 survey,
66% of the sample felt their chance of being caught was less than
one in ten. Further, 37% indicated that the chance of being caught
was too low to deter them from driving while impaired. Related
to this, 31% of the youth surveyed did not know the consequences
of a drunk driving conviction. This survey was conducted before
these laws changed in 1994.
<P>
Economic costs related to impaired driving are also a significant
factor. For example, according to NHTSA studies, if the expected
decreases in fatalities, injuries, and property damage are reached
in 1994, this could result in a savings of $20,658,583 in economics
costs to Indiana, including health care and property costs.
<P>
Studies indicate the reduction of the legal blood alcohol limit
to 0.08 does have an effect on the reduction of alcohol-related
traffic crashes, particularly when combined with on-going public
awareness efforts. The states of New Hampshire, California, and
Vermont all show evidence of a decrease in traffic deaths attributed
to alcohol abuse since they instituted their 0.08 laws. Further
studies indicate, however, that when public reinforcement of the
message against drunk driving is lowered, fatality statistics
may again rise, as was the case in Maine, which also saw an initial
decrease after the passage of its 0.08 law.
<P>
Finally, a study by the Center for Substance Abuse Research at
the University of Maryland shows that the risk for reconviction
for drinking and driving is significantly lessened when alcohol
education and treatment are included in the sentencing conditions.
In a study of sentencing conditions in the state of Maryland,
it was shown that alcohol education and alcohol treatment reduced
the reconviction rate over a three-year period by 22% and 17%
respectively.

<hr>
<a name="gang">
<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT G</B> 
<P>
<B>There is an increasing mobility of gang activity, spreading
to non-urban areas and using youngsters to sell drugs.</B> 
<P>
SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION
<P>
Surveys of law enforcement officials in Indiana conducted by the
Indiana State Police showed a definite increase in identified
gangs and gang members between 1991 and 1993.
<P>
Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the respondents reported marijuana
being sold by gangs in their areas. Cocaine and crack were reported
by 56%. Heroin and LSD were also listed as drugs being sold. Many
respondents reported drugs and weapons being used as incentives
by gang recruiters.
<P>
Theft, stolen property, and narcotics were ranked one, two, and
three as the most prevalent crimes committed by street gangs in
Indiana.
<P>
The survey indicated that gangs are expanding to rural and smaller
communities. The 1991 survey reported no gangs in communities
under 2,000 population and in only 6.1% of cities with 2,000 residents.
In 1993, 24.5% of the respondents in cities under 2,000 and 50%
of these 2,000-3,000 reported gang activity. The smallest jurisdiction
reporting gang activity has a population of 443 persons. Various
reasons were given for this rapid change, including:
<UL>
<LI>Recruitment by gangs from other areas attempting to extend
their influence and gang mobility. New and emerging street gangs
were reported by over 46% of the responding jurisdictions. Eighty-two
percent (82%) of that number attributed the increase to recruitment
by major gangs from other areas.
<LI>Population shifts from larger cities to smaller towns. These
shifts sometimes are by parents moving away from the temptations
of gang involvement. However, often the children who were gang
members, or wanted to be, started their own gangs in these new
areas.
<LI>Offenders from smaller population centers were sent to correction
facilities where they learned to be gang members. Upon return
to their communities they attempt to form their own gangs.
</UL>

<P>
According to a 1992 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, 15% of
students reported gangs present at their schools. Of these, 35%
said they feared attack at school, 24% feared attack going to
or from school, and 13% said they avoided areas inside the school
for fear of attack.
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
<P>
ADMINISTRATIVE

There will be a reduced number of gang related incidents occurring
in Indiana. There will be a reduced number of jurisdictions reporting
gang activity. There will be a reduced number of gangs and gang
members statewide.
<P>
BENCHMARKS
<P>
1995 By the fall of 1995, the State Police will have in place
a standardized survey which will allow for the tracking of the
number of Indiana jurisdictions reporting gang activity, the number
of gangs statewide, and the number of gang members in Indiana
The Fall 1995 survey will also establish the baseline data for
measuring these statistics.
<P>
1996 The Fall 1996 survey will indicate a 10% decrease from the
1995 baseline data in the number of Indiana jurisdictions reporting
gang activity, the number of gangs statewide, and the number of
gang members in Indiana.
<P>
1997 The Fall 1997 survey will indicate a 10% decrease from the
1996 survey data in the number of Indiana jurisdictions reporting
gang activity, the number of gangs statewide, and the number of
gang members in Indiana.

<h2>Indiana Together:  Strategies for A Drug-Free Indiana</h2>
<h3><i>Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana</i></h3>
<HR>

<BODY>

<P>
<B>PROBLEM STATEMENT H</B> 
<P>
<B>There are a high number of violent crimes connected to substance
abuse.</B> 
<P>
SUPPORTIVE DOCUMENTATION
<P>
A recent public opinion poll conducted by The Indianapolis Star
and Indiana University showed that drugs were ranked as the number
one cause of crime, with 24% of the 1,410 respondents agreeing.
<P>
A 1994 National Institute of Justice brief, &quot;Understanding
and Preventing Violence,&quot; indicates that there are many social,
psychological, and community-level influences on aggressive and
violent behavior. Long-range approaches are often needed to attack
these long-term problems. Shorter-range strategies, the brief
suggests, require &quot;altering or eliminating&quot; situational
elements that can facilitate violent acts. Three of these elements
that are singled out by the brief are alcohol, illegal drugs,
and firearms.
<P>
Research supported by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)
states that criminals who use illegal drugs commit robberies and
assaults more frequently than do non-user criminals, particularly
during periods of heavy drug use. As for alcohol, the NIJ research
continues, &quot;for at least the last several decades, alcohol
drinking--by the perpetrator of a crime, the victim, or both--has
immediately preceded at least half of all violent events, including
murders.&quot;
<P>
According to the January 1994 National Crime Victimization Report,
&quot;female victims of rape and aggravated assault were significantly
more likely to perceive their attackers to be under the influence
of drugs or alcohol than females who experienced a robbery or
simple assault.&quot; Further, of those rape and assault offenders,
a higher percentage were reported to have been using alcohol rather
than drugs; while conversely, the offenders of robbery were more
often perceived to be under the influence of drugs other than
alcohol.
<P>
Of rape cases, the study continues, those where there was a prior
relationship between the offender and the victim were more likely
to have had drug or alcohol involvement. In fact, these offenders
were 70% more likely to have been under the influence than were
rapists who were strangers to the victims. And of all spousal
abuse cases, up to 50% show an association to alcohol and other
drugs.
<P>
In its 1994 Report &quot;The Impact of Illegal Drugs on America
and Our Most Critical Domestic Issues,&quot; the Partnership for
a Drug-Free America documented that 48% of those arrested for
homicide and assault test positive for drugs at the time of arrest.
Additionally, the Partnership reports that 79% of state prison
inmates say they used drugs at some point in their lives, and
nearly 62% use them on a regular basis. In Indiana prisons, the
number of offenders who were in substance abuse treatment during
1992 averaged 12.5% of all inmates per month, with an average
waiting list of 1,162, according the Department of Correction.
<P>
The frequency of drug use is also a factor relating to violence
according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report, &quot;Drugs,
Crime, and the Justice System.&quot; &quot;As drug use increases,
so too does crime,&quot; the document states. &quot;Criminal activity
is as much as two to three times higher among frequent users of
heroin or cocaine than among irregular or non-users of drugs.&quot;
<P>
Crime rates can also be traced to the introduction of new drug
trends. According to a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
violent crime in our cities increased dramatically between 1985
and 1990, the years of the crack epidemic. In urban areas alone,
violent crime increased by 37% and aggravated assaults by 43%
from 1989 to 1990.
<P>
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
<P>
LEGISLATIVE
<P>
H1. Increase the existing penalty for the illegal use of firearms
when the use is connected with drug trafficking.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Criminal Justice Institute
<P>
ADMINISTRATIVE
<P>
H2. Integrate violence prevention and conflict resolution concepts
into school drug prevention curricula.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Indiana Department of Education
<P>
ADVOCACY
<P>
H3. Improve alcohol and other drug treatment interventions in
agencies working with clients on violence-related issues.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: Family &amp; Social Services Administration-Div.
of Mental Health
<P>
H4. Advocate that LCCs consider the connection between alcohol,
other drugs, and violence when developing their Comprehensive
Plans.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: The Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free
Indiana
<P>
H5. Advocate for reduced and responsible images of violence in
media, music, art, games, movies, videos, etc.
<P>
<I>Lead Agency</I>: The Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free
Indiana
<P>
EXPECTED RESULTS
<P>
Because of increased cooperation among anti-drug and anti-violence
initiatives, there will be a decrease in the rate of alcohol and
other drug-related violent crime.
<P>
BENCHMARKS
<P>
1995 By Fall of 1995, the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute will
have in place a mechanism for the tracking of drug and alcohol
related violent crimes that coincides with the data collected
at the national level. This information will be used to establish
baseline data on these crime statistics.
<P>
1996 There will be a 5% decrease from the 1995 baseline data on
drug and alcohol-related violent crimes.
<P>
1997 There will be a 5% decrease from the 1996 data on drug and
alcohol-related violent crimes.<HR>

<P>
RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>
R1. INCREASE EXCISE TAXES ON TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL PRODUCTS.
<P>
Indiana is heavily reliant upon federal funds to address alcohol
and other drug problems. In the prevention and education area,
federal funds constitute the vast majority of resources used by
the state agencies charged with specific drug prevention responsibilities.
Those agencies and the percent of expenditures which represent
federal funds are the Department of Education (98.8%), F&amp;SSA-Division
of Mental Health (100%), Department of Health (100%), Division
of Traffic Safety (84.1%), and the Indiana National Guard (100%).
<P>
The Indiana State Police utilizes state funding for virtually
all of its prevention (primarily public awareness) programming.
A number of other state agencies allocate small portions of state
funds for prevention efforts.
<P>
Community-based treatment programs funded by the state are heavily
reliant upon federal funds. The F&amp;SSA's Division of Mental
Health administers the largest amount of treatment funds and federal
dollars make up 79.7% of the funds awarded to treatment providers.
Federal funds amount to 34% of the resources used for treatment
of offenders by the Department of Correction.
<P>
Criminal justice expenditures by state government to address alcohol
and other drug problems are more difficult to calculate, since
enforcement, justice, and correction anti-drug efforts are not
calculated as cost centers. It is fair to say that the majority
of the costs of these efforts are borne by state funding appropriations.
<P>
The dependence on federal funding to support much of the prevention
and treatment, and some of the criminal justice services and activities
in Indiana subjects state and local planners and providers to
changing federal priorities, making continuity of effort difficult.
For example, at the time of this writing, Congress is preparing
to act on the 1994-95 appropriation for the Substance Abuse Prevention
and Treatment Block Grant. A provision of the proposal is to change
the formula that allocates the funds among the states. The new
formula, if enacted, will result in a loss of over $5,000,000
for Indiana programs.
<P>
Many federal administrative and legislative leaders have recognized
the appropriateness of increasing excise taxes on tobacco products
as not only a means of generating revenue for (health) programs
to offset the negative impact on society of those products, but
as a public policy action to impact the price of, thus reducing
demand for, those products. The same case can be made for increased
taxes on alcoholic beverages. With the exception of tobacco products,
alcoholic beverages are far more widely used and abused than any
of the illicit drugs. Decreased consumption rates will result
in lower problem levels.
<P>
Indiana's current excise taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverage
products and comparable data from surrounding states are as follows:
<P>
Tobacco:
<P>
State Cigarettes (pack) Other Products
<P>
Indiana $0.155 15% of Wholesale Price
<P>
Illinois $0.440 20% of Wholesale Price
<P>
Ohio $0.240 17% of Wholesale Price
<P>
Kentucky $0.040 None
<P>
Michigan $0.750 16% of Wholesale Price
<P>
Alcoholic Beverages (per gallon):
<P>
State Beer Wine Distilled Spirits
<P>
Indiana $0.115 $0.4700 $2.68
<P>
Illinois $0.070 $0.2300* $2.00
<P>
Ohio $0.180 $0.3200** $3.38
<P>
Kentucky $0.081 $0.5000 $1.92
<P>
Michigan $0.203 $0.0572*** $3.37****
<P>
* Beverages with 14-20% alcohol content by volume are taxed at
$0.60 per gallon.
<P>
** For wine less than 14% alcohol by volume. Wine over 13.9% alcohol
by volume is $1.00 per gallon. Sparkling wine has a $1.50 rate,
vermouth is $1.10, and mixed beverages having less than 21% alcohol
by volume are $1.20 per gallon. Rates were last increased effective
January 1, 1993.
<P>
*** Beverages with 1~20% alcohol content by volume are taxed at
$.60 per gallon.
<P>
**** Rates vary considerably, with a 13.85% tax rate applied to
the wholesale price of each product. The $3.37 comparative rate
is on an 86 proof whisky product. The range is $1.44 per gallon
to $7.38 per gallon for whisky and scotch beverage products.
<P>
R2. INCREASE ALCOHOL COUNTERMEASURES FEES ON REPEAT DUI OFFENDERS.
<P>
The current alcohol countermeasures fee is fixed at $200 and applies
to those persons whose drivers licenses are suspended as a result
of committing an infraction or offense under IC 9-30-5. There
is no distinction made as to the amount of the fee for the different
offenses, which range from Class C misdemeanors to Class C Felonies.
<P>
Consideration should also be given to applying the $200 fee to
persons whose initial charges under IC 9-30-5 are deferred or
plea-bargained down to traffic offenses, to those found to have
committed an infraction under IC 9-30-15 (open container violations),
and those convicted of charges under IC 7.1-5-7 (minors and alcoholic
beverages).
<P>
The current alcohol countermeasures and interdiction, prosecution,
and corrections fees were established July 1, 1990. These fees
generate approximately $6.6 million a year. Seventy-five percent
of the fees collected remain in the county in which they are collected
and support prevention, treatment, and criminal justice services
and activities contained in comprehensive plans to address alcohol
and other drug problems at the local level.
<P>
R3. EDUCATE JUDGES ON THE USE OF THE INTERDICTION, PROSECUTION,
AND CORRECTIONS FEE.
<P>
Anecdotal reports from some local communities suggest that the
application of the alcohol countermeasures fee is becoming routine,
but that the use of the special fee on persons convicted of an
offense under IC 35-48-4 is spotty. An education program to remind
judges of the availability of this measure will increase the revenues.
<P>
R4. RAISE PERMIT FEES FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTING.
AND RETAILING.
<P>
If the Alcoholic Beverage Commission is to increase the monitoring
of alcohol beverage retail outlets, additional excise police officers
will be needed. An increase in permit fees, with the increased
revenues targeted to additional enforcement, can make the additional
monitoring feasible.
<P>
A comparison of Indiana alcohol manufacturing, distributing, and
retailing permit fees to fees of surrounding states is difficult.
Fees of these types are complex, with a wide range of definitions
and categories. In general, Indiana's existing fees are lower
than other states, based on those fee structures that can be compared.
For example:
<UL>
<LI>Indiana's permit fee for a distiller of spirits is $2,000.
The range of fees in contiguous states is $1,500 to $10,000.
<LI>For wholesalers of beer, Indiana's fee is $1,000, with the
range in surrounding states of $200 to $2,500.
<LI>For retail outlets such as package stores, permit fees in
Indiana range from $105 to $255. The range in nearby states is
from $275 to $675.
<LI>For retail outlets such as drug stores selling liquor, beer,
and wine, permit fees in Indiana range from $255 to $455. The
range in nearby states is $275 to $675.
</UL>

<P>
In general, fees are lower in Kentucky, and higher in Illinois,
Ohio, and Michigan.

<h3>Problem Indicators Status Report</h3>
<b>October 1, 1994</b>
Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana
</a>
<p>
</center>


In 1992, the Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana adopted
12 indicators to provide a statewide measure of progress
in the fight against alcohol and other drug problems, and to provide
information to communities to aid in the assessment of local problems.
Taken as a whole, the indicators describe the extent of the problems in
Indiana.
<P>
Through work on the 12 indicators, the Commission uncovered a
need for more state and local reporting and data collection on
alcohol and other drug problems. Where state or local data are unavailable, 
the most current and comprehensive national data is included.
<ol>
<li> Deaths caused by alcohol- or other drug-related crashes- continued
to decrease.

<li> Single vehicle nighttime crashes - continued to decrease.

<li> Deaths caused by cirrhosis - have not changed.

<li> Deaths caused b- drugs other than alcohol - increased.

<li> Emergency room visits Involving alcohol and other drugs - are
not documented in Indiana.

<li> Average age of first use of alcohol by school students - held
steady.

<li> Monthly use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, cigarettes, and
heroin by youth, ages 12 -17 - increased overall.

<li> Monthly use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, cigarettes, and
heroin by youth, ages 18 - 25 - data is not collected in Indiana.

<li> Incidence of heavy drinking by high school seniors - increased
and remains significantly higher than nationwide.

<li> Average per-capita consumption of alcohol - declined slightly.

<li> Average cost of street drugs - remained stable, except for
the cost of marijuana, which declined.

<li> Incidence of alcohol- and other drug-related negative birth
outcomes - increased statewide.
</ol>
<p>
<HR>

<H4>Problem Indicators Summary</H4>

<P>
October 1, 1994
<P>
Although some progress continues to be made in the fight against
alcohol and other drug problems, there is clear evidence that
advancement has slowed on some fronts and actually regressed in
others. The data in this report brings home the stark reality
that to achieve a drug-free Indiana will require a long-term sustained
effort, one that is continuously evaluated and adjusted according
to changing conditions and results of our strategies.
<P>
Heading the list of areas in which we continue to make good progress
is the reduction of problems associated with impaired driving.
Data on indicators 1 and 2 demonstrate that the combination of
tough state laws, state and local public awareness campaigns,
targeted law enforcement efforts, and coordinated community responses
is paying off. The rates of decline in the number of deaths attributed
to alcohol and other drug-related vehicle crashes and single vehicle
nighttime accidents appear to have slowed in 1993, suggesting
that we need to be alert to the possibility that new strategies
may need to be explored for the future.
<P>
The number of deaths, other than vehicle-related ones, attributed
to alcohol and other drugs, has not changed significantly. Deaths
attributed to cirrhosis of the liver, a measure of the consequences
of heavy extended use of alcohol, has not measurably changed since
1986. Other alcohol and drug-related deaths increased slightly
in 1993, after remaining relatively unchanged for the previous
three years.
<P>
The number of emergency room visits involving alcohol and other
drugs is believed to be a sound problem indicator, but the data
are not available on a routine basis from Indiana hospitals. This
measure is being retained in hopes that a reporting mechanism
will be developed.
<P>
Perhaps the most disturbing news in the report this year is clear
evidence that elementary and secondary school children in Indiana
are using drugs at higher rates than in previous years and that
rates of use are higher than the national average for youngsters
of the same ages. The most significant of the changes are increases
in the use of cigarettes, marijuana, and inhalants. The rate of
alcohol use, which had been declining for three years, did not
change in 1994.
<P>
In contrast to the rate of alcohol use by youth, which remains
higher than national averages, the overall consumption rate of
alcohol in Indiana remains lower than the national average and
continues to decline. Over half of the alcohol (pure ethanol)
consumed by Hoosiers is in beer products.
<P>
The data on the average cost of street drugs measures the supply
and demand for illegal drugs. Prices are affected by a large number
of variables including, but not limited to, source volume, the
perceived risk of apprehension, the effectiveness of interdiction
and law enforcement efforts, the availability of money for purchases,
and consumer demand. The 1994 data shows that the price of cocaine
and crack cocaine has risen in the past year while at the same
time, the price of marijuana has decreased.
<P>
Alcohol and other drug use by pregnant women, and perhaps by men,
is one factor which may contribute to low weights at birth. The
rates of low birth weight have not changed significantly between
1989 and the most recent year for which data are available, 1992.
<P>
In summary, the problem indicators status report contains both
good and bad news. While progress continues on some fronts, there
is disturbing news, particularly with respect to alcohol and other
drug use among our youth. This underscores the need for continuous
examination of strategies and the documentation of results at
both state and local levels .

</i> 402pp.  (1992).  </b>  Represents a three-pronged initiative to 1)

focus is on reaching children of alcoholics, African-American youth, Hispanic

Messages.

<li>CSAP Prevention Monograph No. 10:  <i>A Promising Future:  Alcohol and
Other Drug Problem Prevention Services Improvement.
</i> 127pp.  (1992).  </b>This volume includes discussions of the economic
and human costs of AOD-related problems and how these costs have led to
increased Federal Government support for AOD abuse prevention.  Also

of drug abuse and AIDS.  (BK191).<b>


<li>CSAP Prevention Monograph No. 11:  <i>Identifying the Needs of Drug 
Affected Children:  Public Policy Issues.
</i> 169pp.  (1992).  </b>This volume is based on papers and discussions
from CSAP's first Issues Forum held in November, 1990, which brought

The monograph describes the problem, our current solutions, and what more
needs to be done about this growing problem.  (BK195).<b>

Projects:  New Research in the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug

community action; experiences with policy adoption case studies; community 
trials design issues; and needs assessments or natural experiments in
special settings.  (BKD87).<b>

                    Preliminary Assessment of The Impact of Lowering<br>
                          the Illegal BAC Per Se Limit to 0.08<br>
<p>

Study of the implementation of 0.08 blood alcohol content (BAC)
laws (along with associated activities such as public information
campaigns drawing attention to the laws) provides a preliminary
indication that the laws are associated with reductions in driver
involvement in alcohol-related fatal crashes.  "A Preliminary
Assessment of the Impact of Lowering the Illegal BAC Per Se Limit
to 0.08 in Five States" examines the effects of the 0.08 BAC
legislation on reducing driver involvement in alcohol-related
fatal crashes in California, Maine, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont.
<p>
In 1994, as more states were considering the adoption of 0.08 BAC
legislation, NHTSA conducted a preliminary assessment of changes
in alcohol-related crashes in the states that had passed such
laws.  The five states studied had the 0.08 BAC legislation in
effect for at least two years.  The goal of the study was to
determine if changes in driver alcohol involvement in fatal
crashes had occurred in coincident with the effective date of the
0.08 BAC laws.  
<p>
Data from NHTSA Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) were used
to analyze the level of driver alcohol involvement in fatal
crashes comparing time periods before vs. after the 0.08 BAC
legislation became effective in each state.  Six different
measures of driver alcohol involvement in fatal crashes were
examined for changes in the level of crashes when the "before"
time periods were compared to the "after" time periods in each
state.  Using each of the six measures, the proportion of alcohol
involvement that was experienced before the 0.08 law was compared
to the proportion of alcohol involvement that was experienced
after the 0.08 law, by calculating the percentage change,
yielding thirty comparisons of the level of driver alcohol
involvement in fatal crashes.  Nine of the thirty comparisons
were found to be statistically significant decreases.  The
remaining 21 measures were not statistically significant at the
0.10 level of these, the majority, 16 measures, showed decreases. 
None of the comparisons using the same measures for the rest of
the nation were found to be statistically significant.  The
following table summarizes the findings for statistically
significant decreases.
<p>
<center>
<table border=3>

<tr> <th colspan=3>Summary of Significant Decreases in Driver 
Alcohol Involvement After .08 BAC Legislation</th></tr>

<tr><th>State</th><th>Measure</th><th>Percent Decrease</th><tr>

<tr><td>California</td><td>Alcohol > 10</td><td>-4%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Oregon</td><td>Any Alcohol</td><td>-9%</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>Alcohol > 10</td><td>-11%</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>Police Reported Alcohol</td><td>-13%</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>Estimated Alcohol Involvement</td><td>-11%</td></tr>
                
<tr><td>Utah</td><td>Police Reported Alcohol</td><td>-30%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Vermont</td><td>Any Alcohol</td><td>-36%</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>Alcohol > 10</td><td>-31%</td></tr>
<tr><td> </td><td>Estimated Alcohol Involvement</td><td>-40%</td></tr>

</table>
</center>
<p>
The comparisons of measures of driver involvement in alcohol-
related fatal crashes for the five states studied suggest that
significant decreases occurred following implementation of the
0.08 BAC legislation.  For Oregon and Vermont, significant
reductions were noted for several measures of driver alcohol
involvement, while California and Utah each exhibited one measure
achieving a significant reduction.  However, these findings are
preliminary and further analysis is warranted.  This analysis
does not account for other potentially important factors, e.g.,
other alcohol legislation, that could influence the impact of the
0.08 BAC legislation on reducing alcohol-related crashes.  More
analytical work is underway to further understand the changes in
the level of alcohol involvement in crashes that have occurred
coincident with the passage of 0.08 BAC legislation.

<p>
The  <b>Governor's  Commission  for a Drug Free Indiana</b> is  the  state  organization 
charged  with  developing  a  comprehensive  approach to  alcohol  and  other  drug  problems.  
Indiana is a nationwide leader in assisting communities in addressing their drug challenges  and 
is one of a very few states which has in place a funding mechanism for these efforts:  Indiana's 
Drug-Free Communities Fund.
<p>
<a name=Mission>
<h2>Mission:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>  advise the governor and the Indiana General Assembly on legislative strategies;
<li>  mobilize communities to take drug-free action; and
<li>  coordinate statewide drug-free efforts.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<a name=Structure>
<h2>Structure</a></h2>
<p>
<i>Local Efforts Are Key</i><br>
Each county in Indiana has a local coordinating council (LCC) which is the core of Indiana's 
community-based drug-free efforts.  These groups of local drug-free volunteers meet to assess 
county-wide alcohol and other drug challenges, and to form a comprehensive plan to address 
those challenges.  Each plan includes three major components:  prevention/education, treatment,  
and justice/law enforcement.  Many LCCs have a Youth Advisory Board.   LCC 
representatives meet monthly with other LCC representatives in a Regional Advisory Board.  
Funding for the local plans comes, in part, from Indiana's Drug-Free Communities Fund, 
which channels drug offender and driving-while-intoxicated fees back into local drug-free 
activities.
<p>

Click here to locate 
 <li>  <a  href= http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/indiana/home.html>Local Coordinating  Council  </a> 
contact information.

<p>
<i>Statewide Leadership</i><br>
The Governor's Commission for a Drug Free Indiana is guided by a State Steering Committee 
of 16 volunteers appointed by the governor, and four legislators, who make drug-free recom-
mendations.  They represent various sectors of the community:  labor, religion, community 
organizations, family, media, state government, medicine, judiciary, law enforcement, self-
help, education, youth, local government, and businesses.  In 1994, the State Steering Committee 
gathered input from drug-free advocates across the state to develop <i>Indiana  Together:  
Strategies for Developing a Drug-Free Indiana.</i>  The report forms the blueprint for  state 
government action over the next several years.
<p>
The Commission state staff consists of six agency professionals housed in Indianapolis, and 
19 regional coordinators who work out of offices located in six host agencies across the state.  
Their role is to offer technical assistance to the local coordinating councils (LCCs) in their 
efforts to create a comprehensive local drug-free strategy.
<p>
<p>
<a name=Aware>
<h2>Awareness Efforts</a></h2>
<p>
This statewide network carries out drug-free awareness campaigns and activities.  Currently, 
the Commission's major public awareness effort is the "Deal With It" campaign, which urges 
all Hoosiers to either seek help for an addiction problem, or to get involved and an advocate 
for a drug-free community.  "Deal With It" features various brochures and printed materials 
which can be ordered by community organizations, and a hotline which helps individuals get in 
touch with their local drug-free advocates or treatment options.  
     "Deal With It Hotline"    (800) 9-WITH-IT.
<p>
The  Commission  also  works  closely with the  <b>Governor's  Council  on  Impaired  and 
Dangerous  Driving</b>  on awareness activities and coordinated community efforts  to 
address youth access to alcohol and impaired driving.  The Council is the public opinion  catalyst 
and  the  implementing body for statewide action to reduce death and injury on  Indiana  roadways.
   The Council administers over $7 million in state and federal funding  targeted  through 
traffic safety grants to state and local organizations.

<h2>Indiana State Excise Police</h2>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

The Indiana State Excise Police are the enforcement arm of the Indiana
Alcoholic Beverage Commission, charged with the primary responsibility
of policing the alcoholic beverage industry in the State.  The State
Excise Police enforce the laws which regulate permit holders --those
who are legally permitted to sell and serve alcoholic beverages, as
well as those not legally entitled to sell alcoholic beverages.  <p>
Protecting the welfare of Hoosiers, as well as the alcoholic beverage
industry, is an extensive job.  Officers conduct investigations of
violations by permit holders such as illegal Sunday sales, sales of
alcohol to minors, and bootlegging.  State excise officers also
represent the State on local Alcoholic Beverage Boards in each county.
The boards meet monthly to review applications and renewals for every
alcoholic beverage permit in their county.  Officers must investigate
each permit location before it's permit is reviewed to determine
whether it has met legal standards and is qualified to continue
selling and serving alcoholic beverages.  The officer also votes with
the board on the renewal or issuance of new permits in that county.
The monthly meeting allow resident of the county to voice their
concerns and suggestions about renewals or issuance of permits.

<p>
State excise officers are enforcement professionals trained and certified by the Indiana 
Law Enforcement Training Academy. They work closely with all law enforcement 
agencies in the State to offer assistance and coordinate efforts in monitoring the alcoholic 
beverage commission.
<p>
<h3>PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM</h3>
<p>
The Indiana State Excise Police have launched a statewide public information program 
targeted to increase public and industry awareness about alcohol.  Officers utilize their 
expertise about alcohol and the alcoholic beverage industry to educate the public about the 
effects of alcohol and how it can be used responsibly and safely.
<p>
A large portion of the program is directed toward youth in an effort to combat alcohol 
abuse, hopefully before it begins.  Through films, brochures, and open discussion, officers 
educate  young people about alcohol and the effects of its use and abuse.  Because drunk 
driving is the number one cause of death for young adults, officers discuss the problem 
extensively.
<p>
The State Excise Police also work closely with the alcoholic beverage industry conducting 
training sessions to educate bartenders, waitresses, and servers of alcohol.  Servers are 
taught how to recognize when a customer has had too much to drink and how to 
creatively intervene.  Servers also learn about their legal responsibilities and liabilities.
<p>
The public information program is an example of the positive efforts of the State Excise 
Police to work cooperatively with the alcoholic beverage industry and the public an 
alternative to enforcement.  Officers are available to make presentations to any interested 
groups, schools and organizations at no cost.

<p><FONT SIZE=4>VIII.  COALITION MANAGEMENT PLAN</FONT>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><FONT SIZE=2>The success of this BAA contract program depends upon the establishment of <em>bona fide
</em>Coalitions that are based upon true collaboration among the members.  <em>Pro forma</em> Coalitions that
are autocratically run by the Contractor without real participation by other Coalition members are
unlikely to succeed.  Each proposed Contractor shall develop a detailed management plan
describing how the Coalition will be managed, including the roles played by the Contractor,
subcontractor, and other collaborating member agencies.  The process for collaboration among
Coalition members must be clearly defined and the means of assuring participation of
collaborating member agencies in Coalition decision making must be clear.  The structure of any
committees or advisory panels should be defined, and the means of allowing for participation of
youth, parents or guardians, and the general public in setting Coalition goals should be described.
</FONT>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><FONT SIZE=4>IX.  COALITION TRANSPORTATION PLAN</FONT>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><FONT SIZE=2>The two critical factors responsible for most of the problems in reaching target audiences in
some former DMH-funded prevention programs are: (1) lack of participant access to programs
due to transportation difficulties and (2) lack of a realistic marketing and recruiting plan.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For many early adolescents, the primary means of transportation are a school bus or a bicycle. 
While "walking" may be an adequate transportation plan for a neighborhood-based Services
Program in an urban area, failure to plan for participant transportation would be a plan for
program failure for most Services Programs.  To reduce this risk, each proposed Contractor shall
develop a detailed plan for assuring that participating youth have access to the Services Programs
by assuring that needed services are available to transport participating youth to and from the site
of each Services Program.  This plan can include such sources as public transportation, school
buses, agency vans or buses, or taxi vouchers.  Since it is likely that each Services Program's
transportation needs are different, the Coalition plan must address the transportation strategy
employed by EACH proposed Services Program.
</FONT>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><FONT SIZE=4>X.  COALITION MARKETING PLAN
</FONT>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><FONT SIZE=2>A realistic marketing and recruitment plan is essential to making sure that an adequate number of
targeted youth actually enroll in the Direct Prevention Services Programs.  Each proposed
Contractor shall develop a detailed plan clearly describing the Coalition's plan of marketing its
Direct Prevention Services Programs to the target audience.  The plan must describe a strategy
for informing ALL youth in the target audience about available programs and for actively
recruiting the participation of targeted youth and their parents or guardians.  The plan should be
very specific and should provide detailed plans, rather than general strategies for assuring that the
proposed Services Programs enroll and retain the anticipated number of participating youth.  The
plan must include a strategy for involving local schools and youth-serving organizations in
recruiting and referring students, as well as a plan for utilizing mass media, other community
organizations such as churches and neighborhood organizations, and other means of informing
potential participants and their parents or guardians of the availability of the proposed Services
Programs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Communication patterns and practices in each Indiana community are unique.  Traditional mass
media may be available in many communities, but others may need to rely upon church bulletins,
posters, rural networking, direct mail, and less traditional means of publicity.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the marketing plans for each Services Program, the Contractor's marketing plan
must include a plan for announcing the formation of the Coalition, and for using the media to
recruit additional collaborating member agencies.  Each Coalition will be required to document
its implementation of the marketing plan, and copies of newspaper clippings, flyers, media
releases, and other promotional materials must be retained for inspection by DMH, or its
contractors, at the time of site visits, or upon request.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Target Audience:</strong>   New 7th grade students at Westside       Middle School in Hometown, Indiana Western County)who are undergoing the transition from the more nurturing elementary school environment.  Approximately 600 students (100 each from 6 "feeder" elementary schools).  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Estimated number of participating students = 60 per year [10% of 
<p>target audience.  Note:  Program has space for 100 students (50 per semester), it will serveat least 30 "targeted youth" per semester based upon moderate risk status and family economic status -- it MAY serve up to 20 additional youth, but local funds will support non-targeted youth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Requested DMH funding from Contractor:  $14,400 ($320 x [75% of 60])

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Based upon a local needs assessment, the Western County members of the Local Prevention Services Coalition determined that one important need in their community was to assist students who are "in transition" from the relatively nurturing environment of neighborhood elementary schools to the "large school" environment in their middle schools.  A secondary concern is to provide structured, supervised activities in the after-school hours for students who are at risk of substance involvement due to lack of adult supervision during those hours.  A consortium of youth-serving agencies on
the west side of Hometown propose to create a <em>"Three-to Six Club"</em> to provide a range of direct prevention services for new 7th grade students attending Westside Middle School.  The needs assessment revealed that the local school corporation's drug education curriculum does an adequate job of providing "facts about drugs" and teaching peer resistance skills, so the "focused prevention activities" will concentrate upon the identified local needs of (1) conflict resolution skills, (2) identifying and countering marketing of alcohol and tobacco to youth, and (3) teaching youth how to
plan social activities (as alternative activities) that are alcohol-,  tobacco-, and other drug-free.  All registered youth will participate in the focused prevention activities.  The club also will provide a range of supportive prevention activities that address certain risk and protective factors.  When youth register to participate in the club, the youth and parent/guardian will select two appropriate supportive prevention activities, based upon the individualized needs of the youth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Westside Civic League will manage and coordinate the "<em><strong>Three-to-Six Club,"</em></strong> an after-school program for 7th grade youth who are in transition from an elementary school to a middle school environment.  The program consists of structured after-school activities two afternoons per week, from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. for ten weeks (20 days, 3 hours per day, for a total of 60 contact hours).  The program will serve two groups of approximately 25 youth participants during
the fall semester, and another two groups of approximately 25 youth participants during the spring semester.  The program will consist of four, 45-minute segments each afternoon: (1) structured recreational activities, (2) a focused prevention activity, (3) a free activity/nutritious snack break, and (4) an academic support activity ("homework help" or
"individualized tutoring").

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Focused Prevention Activities: </strong>(all students participate)

<p>6 day Conflict Resolution Education Program [6 45-minute sessions]

<p>6 day Identifying Youth-Oriented Marketing Program [6 45-minute sessions]

<p>Academic Support Activities: (students choose, based upon   individual needs & interests)

<p>"Homework Help," "Individualized Tutoring," remedial skills development, academic enrichment activities, peer tutoring (gifted students may serve as
"cadet teachers" helping other students)

<p><u>Hometown Department of Parks and Recreation</u> has agreed to waive user fees for participating youth to participate in six
"activity" field trips in parks facilities each semester.

<p><u>Hometown Transit Agency</u> has agreed to provide discounted bus passes to transport participating youth home from the
program.

activities.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Staffing:</strong>  John Prevention, an existing professional staff member of the Westside Civic League will serve as Project Supervisor, as a 25% FTE assignment.  He will be the on-site coordinator every day.  He will be assisted by three high school students hired on an hourly basis, and community volunteers.  Collaborating agencies will also provide volunteers
for certain activities on an occasional basis.

<p>Dear Colleagues:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Westside Christian Church is pleased to participate in Midstate Prevention, Inc.'s Local Prevention Services Coalition for Area #7, as a volunteer collaborating agency  We hereby designate the Midstate Prevention, Inc. to act on behalf of the Coalition in all negotiations with the Indiana Division of Mental Health.

<p>Specifically, we agree to work with Midstate Prevention, Inc.'s subcontractor, Westside Civic League, to implement its proposed Direct Prevention Services Program called "Three-to-Six Club."  We will provide space in our education wing to house this after school program two days per week, and will provide use of our recreational facilities during those
times as well. We will recruit enough volunteers to provide two volunteers each day to assist with this program.

<p>The Westside Christian Church has a longstanding interest in youth development work. For more than forty years, we have provided space and services for local youth activities, and have an active youth organization under the direction of our youth pastor. We recognize the importance of providing structured adult supervision for young adolescents in the
after school hours and are willing to contribute the use of our facilities and volunteers to support this project. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to assist with this important project for youth.

<h1>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG USE BY<br>
INDIANA CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h1>
<h2>The Indiana Prevention Resource Center Survey - 1995<br>
Prevalence Statistics<br>
<i>Main Findings</i></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

For the past five years, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration - 
Division of Mental Health (formerly the Indiana Department of Mental Health, 
Division of Addiction Services) has contracted with the Indiana Prevention 
Resource Center at Indiana University to coordinate a longitudinal study of 
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use prevalence in Indiana children and 
adolescents.  This survey provides information about the prevalence of ATOD 
use needed for statewide and local planning purposes.  From March 10 through 
April 20, 1995, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center (IPRC) 
coordinated its fifth annual "Alcohol and Other Drug Use Survey", an annual 
survey conducted in the spring of each year in a scientifically designed 
protocol that yields representative statewide data on the prevalence of 
alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use by children and adolescents in Indiana. 
<p>
The survey was designed with two purposes in mind: (1) to measure ATOD 
prevalence on a statewide basis for statewide planning and evaluation, and 
(2) to measure ATOD prevalence on a local basis for local planning and 
evaluation purposes.  Since detailed information is required by many local 
communities in order to qualify for federal or state funding, a very large 
number of schools volunteer to participate in the IPRC's survey.  
Although other survey instruments are available to local schools, the IPRC 
survey and its reports are provided to the local communities without charge.  
The widespread participation in the surveys generates a statewide sample that 
is much larger than would be needed simply for statewide planning purposes, 
but is needed in  order to generate meaningful community-level data.  
Most participating schools are scheduled to participate on a biennial or 
triennial basis, but the state's largest school district (with about 10% of 
the total state school population) participates annually to avoid skewing 
the "off-year" results.  
<p>
Data were collected in 85 separate community or school corporation surveys 
conducted in 250  schools throughout Indiana.  These surveys yielded 63,631 
usable surveys.  The school surveys conducted in 1995 provided enough data 
from which to draw inferences about alcohol and other drug use by students in 
grades 6 through 12 throughout the entire state.  In the 1991 survey, 23,319 
usable surveys were collected, in 1992, 20,629 usable surveys were collected, 
in 1993 the number of schools participating increased dramatically, resulting 
in 90,586 usable surveys being collected, and in 1994, 81,732 usable surveys 
were collected.   The 1991 through 1993 surveys included fifth graders, who 
were eliminated in 1994.  The fifth grade samples were more difficult to 
obtain, required working with many more elementary schools, and were much 
less reliable due to a disproportionate number of unusable surveys.  
Since data on fifth graders were not required for statewide planning 
purposes, they were eliminated from the 1994 and future samples.  As data are 
reported by grade, elimination of fifth graders does not influence the 
prevalence rates in grades 6 through 12.  While identical populations were not 
sampled each year, the populations are comparable, were selected for 
geographic and community-size balance in an identical manner, and should 
produce comparable data.
<p>
This year's sample is somewhat smaller than the previous two years samples.  
This is due, in part, to a highly publicized campaign supporting statewide 
legislation to protect student privacy and require parental consent prior to 
student participation in confidential surveys.  Several schools withdrew from 
participation at the last moment, due to publicity about "survey abuse."  
We adjusted our sampling quotas to correct for these last minute defections.  
They do not affect our statewide reliability, but did eliminate important 
local planning information in those affected communities.
<p>
An attempt was made to assure geographic and community-size balance, with an 
appropriate number of schools and subjects selected from each region of the 
state, as well as appropriate sized rural, minority, and urban populations.  
The communities selected for participation are representative of the state, 
at large, in terms of rural/urban and ethnic mix.
<p>
Schools are selected in a three-stage purposive stratified sampling process 
to yield a sample that is representative of the state as a whole.  A 
three-stage purposive/quota cluster sampling procedure is used to yield a 
representative sample of Indiana students that are stratified by grade and 
purposively selected taking into account geographic balance, ethnic diversity, 
and community size.  Schools and communities are purposively selected to 
assure proportional representation from the various parts of the state, 
utilizing ten planning regions established by the Governor's Commission for a 
Drug-Free Indiana, and to assure adequate sampling of minority populations 
and of students from rural areas.  Schools then are assigned a quota designed 
to yield appropriate numbers of subjects in each grade.  
Intact classes are randomly selected as sampling clusters.  The sample 
reasonably well represents the sociodemographic makeup of the state, based 
upon the 1990 decennial Census of Population and Housing.  The 1995 sample 
consisted of appropriate subsamples from each of the ten planning regions.
The number of African-American respondents and Hispanic respondents also well 
represented their share of the state's population.  Although not true random 
sampling, the sampling procedure used in this study is comparable to that 
used in the National High School Survey (Monitoring the Future study) (Johnston, 
<i>et al.</i>, 1993), and its massive size (65,000+ participants) and 
representativeness make it a valuable and reliable sample of the population.

The anonymous written questionnaire was selected for reasons of data quality, 
cost and time efficiency and effectiveness, and prior experience.   
Self-administered written questionnaires "were found to produce more complete 
reporting of drug use...[particularly] for reporting of more recent use of 
'harder' drugs." (Schober, <i>et al.</i>., 1992).  This method is 
comparatively less expensive than other data collection methods, and is 
feasible with school-aged youth, given the relatively easy access to this 
population through administration in school settings.  With Indiana's 
relatively strict enforcement of mandatory school attendance laws, more 
than 98% of the youth population under age 16 may effectively be reached 
through school-administered surveys.  School drop-out is a significant 
problem after age 16, and these data reflect only <b>those students still in 
school.</b>  Johnston, <i>et al.,</i> (1993) describe a protocol that can 
be used to estimate the total prevalence (including the drop-out population) 
from data such as these.

<h2>ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND OTHER DRUG USE BY<br>
INDIANA CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
<p>
<b>Prevalence</b> in defined as the rate of "total cases" of a health problem.  
Prevalence rates of drug use are traditionally reported as percentages of all 
drug use over a particular time frame in the entire population at risk.  
This survey uses several different measures of prevalence:
<p>
<b>Lifetime prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade 
or age group that reports using a particular drug at least once in their 
lifetime.
<p>
<b>Annual prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade 
or age group that reports using a particular drug at least once during the 
year prior to the administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Current Use or Monthly prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in 
an entire grade or age group that reports using a particular drug at least 
once in the 30 days prior to the administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Binge drinking</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade or 
age group that reports drinking at least five alcoholic drinks at a sitting 
(approximately the amount needed to raise a person's blood alcohol level to 
about 0.10%) in the 2 weeks prior to administration of the survey.
<p>
<b>Daily prevalence</b> = the percentage of respondents in an entire grade or 
age group that reports using a particular drug an average of once per day 
during the 30 day period prior to the administration of the survey.  [This 
rate is inferred from the frequency response to a question about monthly 
prevalence, which is the same technique used in the two national surveys used 
for comparison purposes.]
<p>

<h3>PURPOSE AND RATIONALE</h3>

This survey was funded by the Indiana Family and Social Services 
Administration - Division of Mental Health, in order to provide a means of 
meeting the needs of both state and local alcohol and other drug professionals 
for information regarding the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use 
among the population of Indiana. There are several 
needs of both community and state which are met by this survey.  This survey 
allows Indiana to meet federally mandated guidelines for the allocation and 
expenditures of funds for drug abuse programs.  The most efficient allocation 
of resources requires accurate information about the extent of alcohol and 
other drug use.
<p>
An accurate assessment of local needs is a major step in designing and 
implementing alcohol and other drug programs for individual communities. This 
survey allows local professionals to assess the need for programs and to meet 
the requirements of funding agencies for an accurate assessment of the extent 
of the local need.  An accurate and comprehensive cross-sectional survey of 
the prevalence of alcohol and other drug use had not recently been conducted 
in Indiana, prior to the PRC's 1991 survey.  The studies that had been 
conducted were largely independent, localized efforts that yielded specific 
information about individual communities.  Some of these studies were not 
conducted by qualified survey researchers, nor were the instruments 
tested for validity and reliability. Other studies were conducted by private 
organizations, often at great expense to the community.                    
<p>
This survey began a useful statewide data base of information about the 
prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use in Indiana.  The 
individual surveys conducted as a part of this survey provide local 
communities with specific information needed by them to assess local 
needs.  Since all of the local surveys were conducted using the same 
protocols and same instruments, and since these protocols and instruments 
yield data that is directly comparable to two major national surveys, valid 
comparisons can be made and reasoned inferences can be drawn from those 
comparisons.
<p>
<h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>

The survey instrument is a four-page self-contained questionnaire developed 
by the Indiana Prevention Resource Center in 1991.  Items are based upon the 
questionnaires developed for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse 
(NIDA, 1993) and for the National Institute on Drug Abuse's "Monitoring the 
Future" National High School Survey (Johnston, <i>et al.</i>, 1991, 1992, 
and 1993), and all of the drug use-related items on the questionnaire are 
directly comparable to items on the national surveys.  Items were selected 
for their value in providing statewide planning data and for comparability 
with national data. Items were constructed to yield data to measure progress 
toward meeting the national health objectives set out in <i>Healthy People 2000.</i>   
All of the items were closed-ended questions, 
including three demographic questions, a six-digit school code that provides 
geographic information, and a series of Likert-type items, arranged in 
subscales, to measure:
<ul>
<li> the incidence and prevalence of cigarette smoking, 
<li> the incidence and prevalence of alcohol, smokeless tobacco, and other 
drug use, 
<li> adverse consequences due to alcohol and other drug use experienced by 
the respondent students, 
<li> perceived risks of using alcohol and other drugs, and 
<li> perceived peer approval/disapproval of the student's alcohol and 
other drug use.
</ul>

In 1995, additional subscales were added to measure:
<ul>
<li> perceived alcohol and other drug treatment needs for children and 
adolescents in Indiana,
<li> safety concerns, violence, and weapons use, and
<li> participation in structured and unstructured recreational and informal 
educational activities.  
</ul>
<p>
This report describes only the responses to the alcohol tobacco, and other 
drug use prevalence questions.  Additional monographs in this series will 
report on the treatment needs; safety, violence, and weapons use; and 
participation in youth activities questions.
<p>
The questionnaire was designed to offer consistency of measurements over 
time, provide statistics that were comparable to nationally-conducted drug 
use surveys, and for ease of use and simplicity.  Therefore, the results can 
be plainly presented in an easily understood format, and the results from 
Indiana can be compared with those from national surveys.  The questionnaire 
is intended for use over several samplings.  There are several benefits to 
this strategy:
<p>
First, it provides for the construction of a large data base. The larger a 
data base, the more inherently accurate and valid the collected data will be.
<p>
Second, the more accurate the Indiana data are, the more accurate the 
comparisons between Indiana data and other national data (as the national 
surveys have collected data from tens of thousands of subjects).
<p>
Third, since the data are comparable both through the structure of the 
questionnaire and the times the questionnaires are administered, any changes 
will more accurately reflect actual changes in the use of the drugs examined. 
These changes can reflect upon various prevention strategies, through pre- 
and  post-testing. For example, if the survey were administered at a school 
before that school begins a new prevention program and then surveyed again 
after the program has been implemented, then subsequent changes 
in the results of the two surveys can better be attributed to that program. 
<p>
During development of the survey, the basic questionnaire was reviewed by a 
panel of experts for content validity, subjected to 6 months of pilot testing 
and review by focus groups of school-aged youth, and tested for reliability 
using the test-retest method (correlation coefficient 0.82).  A SMOG Index of 
Readability was calculated to assure readability at the 5th grade level.  
The survey form is optically scannable, allowing for direct transfer of data 
from the forms to a computer file, utilizing an NCS Op-Scan 10 reader.  
The collected data are analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques, 
and multiple regression through SPSS-X routines operating in a VAX/VMS 
environment.  
<p>
The questionnaire used in this survey was designed by the Indiana Prevention 
Resource Center for use in school settings. All of the questions are 
comparable to both the National High School Survey (conducted by the 
University of Michigan) and the National Household Survey (conducted by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse), which show drug use rates for high 
school 8th, 10th and 12th graders, and for persons aged 12 and over, 
respectively. 
<p>
The basic portion of each questionnaire is divided into sixteen multi-part 
questions.  [See Appendix B for copy of the questionnaire.]   Items were 
selected to gather data comparable to the <i>Healthy People 2000</i> standards 
utilized by the U.S. Public Health Service, with the intention of producing 
data that could be used to assess the state's and a community's success 
at meeting the <i>Healthy People 2000</i> target goals.  Since these goals 
often are the basis for evaluation specified in federal and state grant 
funding announcements, the data will assist Indiana applicants in securing 
such funding.
<p>
As in the previous four surveys conducted by the Indiana Prevention Resource 
Center, all surveys were conducted during a six week period in the Spring so 
that the high school data would be comparable to the National High School 
Survey data.  Further surveys will be conducted during the same time period 
each year, in order to yield consistently valid and reliable results.  
Due to the relatively high rates of new drug experimentation during a 
particular school year, it is necessary to survey all populations at about the 
same time, to avoid "maturation bias."  For example, results of a survey 
conducted in one population in September would not be comparable to results 
of a survey conducted in another population in April because many more 
students may have tried drugs for the first time during the intervening seven months.
<p>
Students complete the questionnaire in private, and anonymously deposit it 
in a collection box or envelope to protect confidentiality.  No identifying 
data are collected, except gender, grade in school, and ethnic background, 
and data are processed by a statistical team that has no direct access to 
the students, to assure anonymity.  Students are given the option of 
declining to participate, or of turning in a blank survey instrument.  More 
than 95% of eligible students complete usable surveys at every site.  
Data collection is supervised by the classroom teachers or a classroom 
monitor provided by the local school, in each school.  A 12-minute 
training videotape and written instructions are provided to all data 
collectors, to assure consistent collection of data.  Each school has a 
school coordinator who is personally trained by the IPRC, and who coordinates 
and trouble-shoots data collection at the schools.  IPRC survey 
staff are available via a toll-free 800-number telephone on all data 
collection days, in the event of questions or problems.
<p>
As a check on self reporting accuracy, students are asked how truthfully they 
had answered the questions.  In 1995, over 96% responded completely 
truthfully, 3% responded mostly truthfully, and less than 1% responded not 
truthfully at all.  Focus groups of students during the 1991 pilot test stage 
reported using the "mostly truthfully" option when they intended to answer 
all items truthfully but were uncertain about the answer to a small number of 
items, such as the inability to recall exact dates or numbers of drug use 
episodes.  An error checking protocol was used to eliminate a small number of 
surveys that fell into three categories: (1) those in which the student 
replied that he/she had responded "not truthfully at all," (2) those with 
more than two inconsistent responses that suggested a random 
pattern of answers (ie. students who report "never used" a particular in 
their lifetime, but then report use of that same drug in the past year or 
past month), and (3) pharmacologic implausibility (ie. students 
who report such excessive use of multiple drugs as to create a cumulative 
effect that would be lethal).  These precautions eliminated surveys that were 
not completed seriously by the respondents.  The protocols are consistent 
with recommended protocols to improve validity of self-reports of drug use 
recommended by an advisory panel on validity issues convened by the                    
National Institute on Drug Abuse. (Rouse Kozel & Richards, 1985).
<p>
To substantiate the consistency of the self reports on the current survey, 
in 1992 a correlation coefficient of the reported use of various drugs on a 
five-point Likert scale was calculated comparing reported levels of use in 
the past year with use in the past month.  The correlation coefficient was 
calculated at +0.83, which was statistically significant at p<.01.
<p>
The perceived risk component consisted of a seven-item belief subscale 
related to perceived risk of physical or other harm from drug use.  The items 
were placed on a four point Likert format ranging from "no risk" to "great 
risk."  This subscale was found to be internally consistent with an alpha 
reliability coefficient of 0.85.  Reported frequency of episodes of 
adverse consequences of the use of alcohol and other drugs was measured on a 
ten-item Likert-type scale asking students to report the frequency of 
use-related events such as hangovers, missed school, or poor performance on a 
test.  This subscale also was found to be internally consistent with an 
alpha reliability coefficient of 0.90.  The subscale on perceived peer 
approval/disapproval consisted of seven items with approve/disapprove 
alternatives.  The items in this subscale were internally consistent with an 
alpha reliability coefficient of 0.82.  
<p>
The instruments were designed to produce data that are comparable with that 
produced by two national surveys: the "National High School Survey" and the 
"National Household Survey."  
<p>
The "National High School Survey," also known as the <i>Monitoring the Future</i>
Survey has been administered every year since 1975 to between 15,000 and 
18,000 graduating high school seniors annually from approximately 150 high 
schools nationwide. Beginning with 1991, this survey also gathered limited 
data from 8th and 10th grade students in the same school corporations.  It is 
administered through the University of Michigan's Institute for 
Social Research on behalf of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
The results used in this report's comparisons are those from approximately 
17,000 seniors nationwide constituting the graduating class of 1994, as well 
as preliminary data from approximately 18,800 8th graders 
and approximately 15,500 10th graders in the 1994 national surveys, 
the latest national data available.  
<p>
The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse has been conducted every two to 
three years since 1972 directly by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.  
The results from the 1990 survey were compared with the 1991 Indiana survey.  
The 1992 household survey is the eleventh study in a series of studies aimed 
at determining drug use rates among the American household population aged 
12 and over.  Only the results from those respondents ages 12 to 17 
were used in comparisons with Indiana students in grades 6 to 11.
<p>
<h4>Limitations and Possible Sources of Error</h4>

As in all surveys, the possibility of errors and the limitations of the 
survey, its instrument, and the manner in which it is distributed, must be 
taken into account when interpreting a survey's results. The following 
limitations are possible sources of such errors in regard to this survey:
<p>
<b>Nonsampling errors</b> = those errors which are the result(s) of recording 
mistakes (respondents marking the wrong answer, ie. doesn't actually apply to 
them), coding errors (the machine skips or misreads a response), missing data 
(some respondents don't answer all the questions), and differences in 
respondents' interpretations of the  questions and answers. These were 
minimized for this survey by a pre-testing conducted at Indiana University, 
specialized training of people who administered the survey, 
coding checks when completed questionnaires were scanned, and checks of 
quality control.  Where the survey team suspects nonsampling errors, these 
have been noted in this report.  
<p>
<b>Sampling errors</b> = those errors that occur from the way in which the 
respondents are chosen and populations are targeted. In other words, the 
reported current use of a particular drug may vary slightly from one sample 
to the next, because of the natural differences which exist in people, their 
location, social practices, etc. and the manner in which they are chosen to 
participate in the survey.  For example, people in the far southern end of 
the state may have slightly different use rates of particular drugs than 
people in the extreme northwest corner of the state, and the state-wide 
results may not reflect an accurate picture of the drug use rates throughout 
the state if disproportionate numbers of people are sampled in the south 
relative to the northwest portion of the state.  These errors were minimized 
by allocating the number of sites in each of the 10 geographic regions used 
by the Governor's Commission for A Drug-Free Indiana and by setting a minimum 
of 50 respondents and a maximum of 2,500 respondents at each site.  
<p>
Scientists use statistical formulas to calculate an estimate of the amount of 
sampling error.  Hundreds of such estimates would have to be made for this 
report, based upon the exact number of responses in each cell category.  To 
avoid unnecessary difficulty in reading such reports, it is customary to 
report the <b>average</b> estimate of sampling error, recognizing that the 
error may be larger in cells with very small numbers of respondents.  
<p>
<b>For the youth populations, the average estimate of sampling error for this the 
whole population and for each grade 6 through 12 in this report is less than &#177;1%, 
within a 95% confidence level.  This means that we estimate that if the same 
number of respondents were sampled 100 times, using the same techniques, 
that in 95 or more of the 100 times, the percentages reported would be within 
or 1% of the percentages reported here.</b>
<p>
In addition, the following should be taken into consideration when attempting 
to interpret the results presented in this report:
<ul>
<li> self-reporting depends on accuracy of memory and honesty in answering 
questions. 

<li> the sample from the National Household Survey used to compare grades 
6 to 11 in Appendix A was relatively small (2,177) compared to the Indiana 
sample of more than 63,000 for the same age group.

<li> those people surveyed were the ones who attended school or work on the 
day on which the survey was conducted at their location. It does not 
(nor does the National High School Survey) sample absentees or school 
dropouts, nor was it a compulsory survey.   Participation in all three 
surveys was strictly voluntary.

<li> the National Household Survey uses a "household interview" technique 
that relies upon oral responses to questions posed by an interviewer.  
This technique may produce results that are not directly comparable to the 
"anonymous written questionnaire" techniques utilized by the PRC survey and 
by the National High School Senior Survey.
</ul>

<h3>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 1995 FINDINGS</h3>

<b>NOTE TO READERS:</b>
<p>
In the tables and graphs found in the next section, the prevalence data 
reported herein are compared with data from a national survey conducted in 
1994 (and annually since 1975) -- the National High School Survey, also known 
as the <i>Monitoring the Future</i> Study, which is 
used as the standard of comparison for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.  In 
Appendix A, the data also are compared with the National Household Survey - 
1988 and 1990, which were used to establish certain target objectives for the 
year 2000 in <i>Healthy People 2000:  Health Objectives 
for the Nation.</i>  The National Household Survey reports only a pooled 
statistic for ages 12 through 17 and is used as a standard of comparison for 
grades 6 through 11.  It is important to note that the latest Indiana data 
are for 1995, and the most recent national comparison standards are from 1994 
and previous years.  Since drug use prevalence trends vary from time to 
time, this difference in data collection time frame should be taken into 
account when interpreting these data.  <b>At press time for this report, 
tobacco use data from the 1994 national survey had not yet been released, so 
that charts and tables reflect a comparison with national data 
on tobacco use through 1993.</b>
<p>
The most useful picture of adolescent use of alcohol, tobacco, and other 
drugs will be found by examining data for <b>high school seniors.</b>  The 
data on seniors shows the full extent of use and best describes the use of 
drugs by older adolescents.  Data on younger students become less and less 
relevant for the total picture as age drops, but are useful in describing 
patterns of use at a particular age and in planning age- or grade-appropriate 
prevention programs.
<p>
<b>NOTE TO NON-INDIANA READERS:</b>
<p>
In various places in this report, we use the term "Hoosier" to describe a 
resident of or attribute of the State of Indiana.  This is accepted local 
usage.  Hoosier means "of Indiana" and is not just descriptive of residence 
-- it is a way of life.  The term "Indianian" is <b>never</b> used in 
the State of Indiana.
<blockquote>
<i>"I insist that the Hoosier is different mentally and spiritually to the 
average person.  He is softer, less sophisticated, more poetic and romantic.  
He dreams a lot.  He likes to play in simple ways.  He is not as grasping as 
some other Americans.  In a crude way, perhaps, he has the temperament of the 
artist, and so I still look to Indiana and its children, at least, 
to do great things..."</i><p>
Theodore Dreiser in <i>The Nation</i>
</blockquote>

<h3>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h3>
Three years of morale-breaking cutbacks in federal appropriations for 
school-based drug prevention programs, and the resulting devastation in 
school-based programming levels and prevention staff layoffs are taking their 
toll on Hoosier children and adolescents.  For the third straight year, 
significant increases in marijuana use have been noted.  The significant 
progress we observed in national statistics from 1980 through 1992  and in 
Indiana statistics from 1991 through 1992 has stopped.  Indiana students 
report increased use of cigarettes, marijuana, inhalants, and most other 
drugs between 1993 and 1995.  Significant findings from the 1995 survey 
include:
<ul>
<li> The increased use of marijuana by Hoosier children and adolescents that 
we reported the last two years, continued unabated in 1995.  All measures of 
prevalence (lifetime, annual, monthly, and daily) increased again this year 
at all grade levels.  This trend was also reported for 1994 by the National 
High School Survey (Johnston, et al., 1994), by the PRIDE National Survey, 
and for Marion County, Indiana by Project I-STAR.  For high school seniors, 
lifetime use increased from 31.0% in 1992 to 40.0% in 1995, annual use 
increased from 23.7% to 34.6% between 1992 and 1995, monthly 
use increased from 14.4% to 24.0%, and daily use increased from 3.9% to 7.4%, 
again from 1992 to 1995.  Nationally, the upswing in marijuana use in 1993 
that reversed a 14-year decline in use from 1978 to 1992, continued in 1994. 
Positive references to marijuana use continued to increase in popular music, 
films, and other media.

<li> Daily, monthly, annual, and lifetime cigarette smoking increased at most 
grades, which for the second consecutive year reversed the decline among 
Hoosier students that we reported in 1992 and 1993.  This increase mirrors 
the increase reported the last two years by the National High School Survey.  
The increase in cigarette smoking is particularly worrisome, since daily 
cigarette smoking is the best statistical predictor of future 
use of alcohol and other drugs (Torabi, Bailey, and Majd-Jabbari, 1993).  
Among children and adolescents, daily smokers are three times more likely to 
drink heavily and ten to sixty times more likely to use controlled substances 
as are non-smokers.

<li> The one bright spot in the 1995 findings is binge drinking (consumption 
of five or more drinks on a single occasion at least once in the two weeks 
prior to survey), which continues to decline slowly. Binge drinking rates for 
1995 were the lowest reported since 1991, and show a significant decline over 
the five year period.  The rates still exceed national levels, however. 

<li> On the other hand, use of psychedelic drugs (particularly LSD, but also 
including mescaline, psilocybin, ecstasy, and others) increased abruptly in 
1995.  Monthly use by high school seniors showed a dramatic increase from 4.4% 
in 1994 to 8.2% in 1995.  Significant increases were observed in grades 10 
through 12.  We noted this level of increase in a handful of local community 
surveys in 1994 -- the trend apparently has gone statewide in 1995.  

<li> Another area of concern is an apparent disproportionately high rate of 
use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, inhalants, tranquilizers, and 
narcotics that we reported last year among members of the high school class 
of 1997 (now 10th graders in 1994).  The National High School Survey 
(Johnston, et al., 1994) and the American Alcohol and Drug Survey (Edwards, 
1993) both reported increases in drug use by 8th graders in 1993.  We have 
observe a dramatic increase in illegal drug use by members of this 
same class cohort.  It is too early to determine if the use rates for this 
high school class are an anomaly, or are a predictor of future problems among 
members of this and subsequent 10th grade classes.

<li> Use of inhalant drugs (nitrous oxide, volatile nitrites, and 
petroleum-based solvents) also appears to be on the increase.  Lifetime, 
annual, and monthly use increased in almost all grades -- many at 
statistically significant levels.  Current (monthly) use is at 
its greatest level in 8th grade, and annual use is greatest in 9th grade -- 
both declining in higher grades.  Inhalant use is the only observed form of 
drug use that peaked in the middle grades and then declined.  Use of all 
other drugs increases year-by-year.

<li> Hoosier students in grades 6 through 12 still maintain their much 
higher-than-national rates of illegal use of prescription drugs.  Use of 
amphetamines, tranquilizers, and prescription narcotics by Indiana children 
and adolescents are at rates two to six times higher than reported in the 
national surveys.  The national rates dropped dramatically  during the 1980's 
-- Indiana's present rates are similar to those seen at the national level 
a decade ago.

<li> Early experimentation with cigarettes continues to be a problem, with 
nearly 4% of Hoosier children reporting experimentation with cigarettes by 
age 7, and more than 9% reporting at least some use by age 9.  More than 7% 
of Hoosier students report at least some use of alcohol prior to age 7 and 
more than 12% have used alcohol by age 9.   This early use of the gateway 
drugs of tobacco and alcohol may be a major contributor to Indiana's 
above-the-national average rates of controlled substance use.

<li> As a matter of fact, nearly all of the increases in other drug use 
noted in this survey are closely correlated with the increases in cigarette 
use over the same time frame.  If the cigarette smoking rates are 
artificially adjusted to hold them constant, use of other drugs also remains 
essentially unchanged.  This suggests that nearly all of the increase 
in other drug use is occurring in the increasingly larger pool of students 
who choose to smoke cigarettes.

<li> As reported last year, for all drugs, use by males exceeded use by 
females.  Surprisingly, however, there still was significant use of smokeless 
tobacco and anabolic steroids by female students, despite the fact that these 
drugs are often assumed by the public to be "male drugs."  More than 10% of 
female juniors and seniors report some use of smokeless tobacco.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>IV. Minimum Requirements for Contractors<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1.Each &quot;Contractor&quot; (or &quot;Primary Contractor&quot;)
shall be a governmental or incorporated entity with the demonstrated
ability to manage state government contracts. If the contractor
is not a governmental entity subject to audit by the State Board
of Accounts, the contractor shall have financial records audited
by an external accounting firm. Upon selection, each Contractor
shall submit a management plan acceptable to DMH.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2.Each contractor shall designate a single &quot;project
director,&quot; who shall have ultimate management responsibility
for the contract; a &quot;fiscal officer,&quot; who shall maintain
fiscal records and reports; and a &quot;program director,&quot;
who shall be a full-time prevention professional who serves as
coordinator of the Coalition, and who provides technical assistance
and oversight for the Direct Prevention Services Programs offered
by the Coalition. A &quot;Program Director&quot; must possess
&quot;Level 1&quot; recognition (or its equivalent) as a prevention
professional in Indiana, or attain such recognition by April 1,
1998.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<a name = "#perform">
<FONT SIZE=4>V. Minimum Performance Standards for Contractors
<BR>
</FONT>
</a>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1.Each Contractor shall provide adequate staffing
and resources to operate the Coalition, that shall include, at
a minimum, a program director assigned to the Coalition on a 100%
full-time equivalent (FTE) basis, and a clerical staff member
assigned to the Coalition on a 100% FTE basis. If required by
the size of the designated service area, a Contractor may provide
additional staffing for the Coalition.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2.Each Contractor shall assure the Division of Mental
Health that services programs offered by the Coalition shall comply
with the standards set by the Division, shall be limited to the
proven prevention strategies approved by the Division, and shall
serve only the program's target audience. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>3.Each Contractor shall develop a collaboration plan
for delivery of direct prevention services to targeted youth residing
in its defined service area. The collaboration plan shall be based
upon a local needs assessment using data from the defined service
area, and shall be based upon accepted prevention theory and principles.
The plan shall describe the rationale for selecting the proposed
Direct Prevention Services Programs, a plan for active involvement
of Coalition members, parents, and youth in the decision making
processes of the Coalition, a marketing plan for publicizing the
Direct Prevention Services Programs to youth and parents and for
recruiting participating youth, a transportation plan for assuring
youth access to program sites, and an evaluation plan consistent
with the specified program objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>4.Each Contractor shall establish a set of program
objectives for the Coalition, including two specified process
objectives and four specified impact objectives. Each proposed
Services Program shall base its set of program objectives upon
the Coalition's program objectives, and each Services Program's
program objectives shall include two specified process objectives,
one or more outcome objectives, and four specified impact objectives.
The Contractor shall be responsible for collecting all required
reporting and data collection forms from each subcontractor and
for collating those forms and forwarding them to DMH's technical
assistance contractor, the Indiana Prevention Resource Center,
within 30 days of the required reporting date. Data from these
forms will be used to evaluate the Coalition's and each Service
Program's progress at meeting its objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>5. The Contractor shall be responsible for monitoring
each Services Program and for training Services Program staff
and volunteers in contract and subcontract requirements. The contractor
shall verify that each Services Program is conducting its programs
as described in the proposal, and is meeting each of the minimum
requirements for direct prevention service programs listed in
this BAA below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>6.Each program funded under this BAA shall comply
with all statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by federal
or state agencies having jurisdiction over these programs. Contractors
shall be responsible for assuring the compliance of each of their
subcontractors with all program and contract requirements. Each
Contractor shall submit monthly service and fiscal reports, quarterly
evaluation reports, and shall send representatives to required
meetings called by DMH. Each Contractor will serve a pre-determined
defined service area, and will utilize a required set of program
objectives specified below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>7.The federal enabling legislation that provides
the funds for this BAA requires that programs and services funded
supplement, and not supplant existing programs. This has been
interpreted to require that only new programs or services (or
significant capacity expansions of existing programs) can be funded.
Funding for existing programs may not be transferred to this BAA,
even if the funding for those programs is expiring. All programs
funded under this BAA must be new programs and/or services or
must provide significant expansions of the enrollment capacities
of existing programs, and must not supplant any program existing
as of the date on which this BAA was released.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>8.At its option, the selected contractor may negotiate
with the DMH to provide the additional service of operating a
Law-Education Partnership program within one or more school corporations
within its designated service area. This Law-Education Partnership
will involve collaboration among local law enforcement organizations,
one or more school corporations, and other community agencies.
The response to this Broad Agency Announcement need not address
this option, which will be negotiated with the selected contractor
at the time of contracting.<BR>

<p>VI.  <font size="+1">Minimum Requirements for a Local Prevention Services Coalition<br>
</font>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p></FONT SIZE=2>A <em><strong>"Local Prevention Services Coalition" (or "Coalition")</em></strong> is a group of at
least six independent, service-providing organizations that collaborate to provide substance abuse
prevention services to targeted youth within a "defined service area."  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>1.  Each Coalition will be coordinated by a "Contractor" that manages and coordinates the
activities of the Coalition.  Each local prevention services coalition shall consist of a primary
contractor and collaborating member agencies that have joined together to deliver a coordinated
series of Direct Prevention Services Programs designed to prevent future substance abuse
problems among 10- through 14-year old youth residing in the Coalition's defined service area.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2.  Each Coalition shall include at least five subcontractors, and additional volunteer
collaborating agencies, in addition to the primary contractor.  Each Coalition shall offer at least
six "Direct Prevention Services Programs", conducted by subcontractors or by the primary
contractor itself.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>3.  At least some targeted youth in every county in a Coalition's defined service area shall have
the opportunity to participate in at least one of the Coalition's Direct Prevention Services
Programs.  In most cases, it is expected that a Coalition will have at least one subcontractor in
each county in a Coalition's defined service area; in any event, at least one Direct Prevention
Services Program must be provided in every county in the Coalition's defined service area.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>4.  While the response to this BAA need not identify every potential subcontractor and every
services program to be offered by a Coalition, responses will be evaluated based upon their level
of completeness.  At a minimum, each response must identify at least the required minimums of
six services programs and five subcontractors.  Each proposed Services Program shall be
described in a brief 3-page profile using the format prescribed by DMH.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>5.  Before a Services Program shall be funded the Coalition must submit to DMH or its designee,
a brief, 3-page description of each proposed Services Program, including a description of the
target audience, projected number of participating youth, a program outline, and a budget for the
Services Program.  This description shall follow the format prescribed by DMH.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>6.  Each Coalition proposal shall include a "letter of designation and commitment" from <u>each
</u>identified collaborating member agency.  Each letter of designation and commitment shall
authorize the Contractor to act on behalf of the Coalition in all dealings with the DMH, and shall
clearly and specifically describe the role that the collaborating member agency shall play in the
Coalition (ie. subcontractor, volunteer collaborating organization, etc.).  Every commitment of
each collaborating member agency described in the proposal (ie. provision of space, volunteers,
services, etc.) shall be specifically listed in that agency's letter of designation and commitment. 
Each letter of designation and commitment shall be signed, in ink, by an official who is
authorized to contractually bind the collaborating member agency.

</center><h6>Alcohol Alert, a publication of the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, provides timely information on alcohol
research and treatment to health professionals and other
interested people.  This issue is the fifteenth in the
series.</h6> <h2>Alcohol and AIDS</h2>
<p>         
There are two reasons to investigate connections between alcohol, HIV 
infection, and AIDS: alcohol may adversely affect the immune system, 
and alcohol may influence high-risk sexual behavior.
<p>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the agent that causes acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome(AlDS).  HlV is transmitted through sexual contact 
with an infected individual, through exchange of infected blood or blood 
products, or to the newborn from an infected mother.  HIV-infected persons 
may harbor the virus for many years with no clinical signs of disease.  
Eventually, HIV destroys the body's immune system, mainly by impairing a 
class of white blood cells whose regulatory activities are essential for 
immune protection.  As a result, people who have AIDS are prone to lung 
infections, brain abscesses, and a variety of other infections caused by 
microorganisms that usually do not produce disease in healthy people.  
Those who have AIDS also are prone to cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, 
a skin cancer rarely seen in non-HlV-infected populations.  The diagnosis of 
AIDS depends in part on the presence of one or a number of these infections 
and cancers (1).*
<p>
One million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with 
HIV (2).  At least 40,000 new HIV infections are thought to occur among 
adults and adolescents, and an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 new HIV infections 
are thought to occur among newborns each year.  Currently, 8 to 10 million 
people worldwide are estimated to be infected with HIV (3).  Of these,
50 percent are expected to develop AIDS within 10 years, and 90 percent may 
develop AIDS within 20 years of initial infection (4).  The prognosis for 
persons with AIDS is grim: AIDS-associated mortality may approach 85 percent 
within 5 years of diagnosis (5).
<p>         
<h3>Alcohol and the Immune System</h3>
Alcohol can impair normal immune responses that protect the body from 
disease (6,7,8).  Chronic alcohol consumption has been shown to reduce 
the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in laboratory animals
(9,10,11) and in humans (12,13).  Chronic alcohol ingestion or alcohol 
dependence can depress antibody production and other immune responses in 
animals (10,9) and in humans (14,15).  Alcohol can suppress activities of 
certain immune system cells, called macrophages, that help keep the lungs 
free from infection (16,17).  In addition, alcoholics appear to be more 
susceptible to bacterial infections and cancer than are nonalcoholics (18,19).  
Studies in animals and in humans indicate that consuming alcohol during 
pregnancy can decrease immune resistance in the offspring (20,21,22).
<p> 
Alcohol's generally immunosuppressive effects couid mean that 1) drinking 
may increase vulnerability to HIV infection among people exposed to the 
virus, and that 2) among people who are already HIV infected, 
alcohol-induced immunosuppression might add to HlV-induced immunosuppression, 
and speed the onset or exacerbate the pathology of AlDS-related illness.  
These are complex ideas and areas of intense investigation, but so far only a 
few studies have been published.  Researchers have learned that alcohol can 
impair white blood cell responses to HIV (23).  A provocative study that 
warrants replication found that a single drinking episode depressed certain 
immune responses of white blood cells taken from healthy volunteers (24).
<p>   
In addition, white blood cells isolated after this drinking episode were more 
susceptible to HIV infection than were cells isolated from subjects who did 
not drink, hinting that even occasional alcohol consumption may increase the 
likelihood of infection upon exposure to HIV.  Whether alcohol use influences 
the progression of AIDS in persons already infected with HIV has been 
explored in a recent study of homosexual men (25).  While these researchers 
found that neither alcohol nor other drugs seem to influence the progression 
of HIV infection or the development of AIDS, their results await 
confirmation.  Clearly, more research is needed to understand alcohol's role 
in HIV infection and the course of ensuing disease.

<h3>Alcohol and Sexual Behavior</h3>

Sexual practices considered to be high risk for acquiring HlV from an 
infected individual include vaginal or anal intercourse without a condom: 
other sexual practices that facilitate exchange of blood, semen, or other 
body secretions; and unprotected sexual activities with multiple partners.  
The frequency with which sexual partners engage in such practices also 
influences the risk for exposure to HIV.
<p>
Alcohol's relationship to high-risk sexual behavior may be explained in two 
ways.  First, alcohol use may be a marker for a risk-taking temperament: 
those who drink alcohol may also engage in a variety of high-risk activities, 
including unsafe sexual practices, as a part of a "problem behavior syndrome" 
(26,27).  Second, alcohol may influence high-risk behaviors at specific 
sexual encounters by affecting judgment and disinhibting socially learned 
restraints (28,29).   These are not mutually exciusive interpretations.
<p>
In addition, these two explanations have different implications for the 
prevention of high-risk sexual behavior.  Among people who have a risk-taking 
temperament, reducing alcohol consumption may not reduce high-risk sexual 
behavior.   However, among those who are more likely to take sexual risks 
when they are drinking, than when they are not, reducing alcohol consumption
should also reduce high risk sexual behavior.
<p>
There are two approaches to studying alcohol's relationship to sexual
behavior that may result in HIV infection (30).   One approach examines 
whether alcohol use in general is correiated with sexua risk-taking 
behavior in general.  In this approach, an observed association between
drinking and high-risk sexual activity could imply that these two behaviors 
are part of a large risk-taking tendency, or that alcohol itself influences 
sexual risk-taking, or both.  Another approach examines the consequences of 
alcohol use during specific sexual encounters.  An observed connection 
between alcohol use and sexual risk-taking during specific encounters 
suggests a direct influence of alcohol on such behavior.
<p>
A number of studies have identified associations between drinking and 
high-risk sexual activity.  These studies also have found that an absence 
of or a reduction in alcohol use is associated with a decrease in high-risk 
sexual behavior.  A study of heterosexual drinking habits and sexual behavior 
found that women and men who frequently combined alcohol use with sexual 
encounters were generally less likely to use condoms during intercourse (31).  
Similarly a study of homosexual men found alcohol or other drug use combined 
with sexual activity to be strongly associated with high-risk sexual behavior: 
even those who drank only occasionaily at the time of sexual encounters 
were twice as likely to be categorized as "high-risk," based on the frequency 
of involvement in a range of sexual practices within nonmonogamous 
relationships, than were those who did not drink (32).   Further, those men
who did not drink during sexual encounters were three times more likely to 
be classified in a "no risk" category than were men who combined drinking 
with sexual activity.  Recently, a reduction in alcohol use among homosexual 
men has been associated with a reduction in high-risk sexual behavlor (33).
<p>
Other studies that examine the consequences of alcohol use at specific sexual 
encounters also have demonstrated a connection between alcohol use and 
high-risk sexual behavior.  Scottish adolescents who drank at the time of 
first intercourse were less likely to have used a condom than those who did 
not drink (34).   A survey of adolescents in Massachusetts revealed that teens 
were less likely to use condoms if sexual activity foliowed drinking or other 
drug use (35).  Similarly, adult homosexual men and heterosexual women (but 
not heterosexual men) reported tnat they were less likely to use a condom 
during those sexual encounters in which they felt intoxicated (36).  
These reports of simultaneous alcohol use and high-risk sexual behavior 
suggest that alcohol can directly influence sexual risk-taking.  However, 
these combined behaviors may still reflect a risk-taking tendency in some 
individuals.
<p>
Further research is needed to define conditions under which alcohol use is 
linked to high-risk sexual activity.  Information generated from such studies 
will be vital for developing and improving programs to prevent HIV 
transmission.

<h3>Alcohol and AIDS- A Commentary </h3
by NIAAA Director Enoch Gordis, M.D.
<p>
Science has made remarkable progress in our understanding of HIV and AIDS.  
Yet we know very little about the role of alcohol in the transmission and 
acquisition of HIV or in the progression ot HIV infection to AIDS.  Such 
knowledge would enhance efforts to prevent HIV exposure and decrease the 
number of new AIDS cases.
<p>
We know that alcohol affects the immune system.  This suggests that alcohol 
could affect the course of HIV infection and AIDS, which is a disease of the 
immune system.  For example, alcohol might affect the body's ability to 
defend against HIV infection upon exposure to the virus: alcohol might alter 
the course of infection to the development of AIDS; or alcohol might affect 
the severity or duration of the special infections, known as opportunistic 
infections, that characterize AIDS.  So far, the research findings in this 
area are hard to reconcile.  On one hand, laboratory evidence shows clearly 
that alcohol impairs the ability of white blood cells to defend against the 
human immunodeficiency virus. On the other hand, studies involving human
populatlons have found that neither alcohol nor other drugs modify the course 
of HIV infection or AIDS.  Given the complexity of the human immune system,
the contradictions presented by these findings, while puzzling, are not 
unexpected.  One key to solving this puzzle will be more attention, in 
long-term studies of human populations, to objective evidence of drinking 
and to laboratory evidence of immune function status.
<p>
We know also that alcohol is associated with high-risk sexual activity that 
potentially can result in exposure to HIV.  Some people may be more likely 
to engage in certain sexual behaviors when drinking as a result of alcohol's 
disinhibiting effects.  (In others, alcohol use and unsafe sexual 
practices seem to be a part of a "risk-taking temperament," in which unsafe
sexual practices may occur whether or not alcohol is consumed.)
<p>
Prevention efforts that address the link between alcohol consumption and 
unsafe sex are being evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing high-risk 
sexual activity.  In addition, researchers are investigating various 
settings, such as bars and alcohol treatment programs, and certain groups,
such as teenagers, where intervention strategies could be employed to
decrease alcohol-related high-risk sexual activity.  It is hoped that these 
findings will help target HlV-related prevention strategies in a way that 
will help to reduce the incidence of new cases of HIV infection, and 
ultimately reduce the number of persons with AIDS.

<TITLE>Principles of Prevention Program Design</TITLE>


</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor = "#ffffff">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>III. Principles of Prevention Program Design That
Must Be Incorporated into the Design of Each Coalition and Each
Services Program<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Prevention Programs funded by the Indiana Division
of Mental Health under this BAA must be based upon the following
principles:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1.Successful drug prevention programs require the
interaction of the three most powerful institutions in the lives
of adolescents: family, school, and community. All programs funded
under this BAA must demonstrate that all three of these institutions
are involved in the planning and implementation of the proposed
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2.&quot;Stand alone&quot; programs implemented by
single agencies without the active collaboration of other community
organizations have historically been much less effective than
those implemented by coalitions of organizations that work together
for the benefit of their clients. All programs funded under this
BAA must be collaborative efforts planned by a true Local Coalition
and implemented by multiple agencies working together.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>3.In order for prevention programs to affect substance-use
behaviors, programs must be of sufficient intensity and duration
to provide an &quot;adequate dose&quot; of prevention activities.
Superficial programs of insufficient duration, programs that do
not attract the regular attendance of participants, and those
that are not focused have not been demonstrated to be effective.
All programs funded under this BAA must be of sufficient intensity
and duration to be expected to produce a measurable impact upon
future substance-using behaviors of the participants. This will
be operationally defined as requiring at least 40 contact hours,
on at least 15 different days, over a period of at least 6 weeks.
Participants should be expected to attend at least 80% of the
scheduled sessions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>4.Over the past decade, enough research evidence
has been obtained to demonstrate that certain prevention strategies
can be predicted to reduce substance-using behaviors, and other
strategies are unlikely to reduce such behaviors. The purpose
of this BAA is to produce the greatest reduction in substance-using
behavior possible with the amount of funding available; it is
not intended to try new and unproven strategies. All programs
funded under this BAA must be based upon strategies that have
already been demonstrated to be effective in reducing adolescent
substance use, and must be included on the DMH list of approved
focused prevention activities or supportive prevention activities.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>5.The level of funding available cannot provide full
funding for meaningful prevention services for all eligible youth.
In order to assure that services are provided in all Indiana counties,
and to maximize the availability of prevention services, all programs
funded under this BAA will require significant local funding contributions.
All programs funded under this BAA must document the level of
local funding. The level of funding provided assumes that each
Contractor will utilize up to 20% of the total requested funds
for administrative costs, including the salary and benefits for
the program director, and other costs associated with administering
the project, and that the Services Programs will be funded only
for direct programming costs. It was assumed that subcontractor
overhead, indirect costs, and non-programming costs for Services
Programs would not be paid with DMH funds. Local contributions
would be used to provide these expenses. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>6.With the limited available funds, it is necessary
to establish funding priorities that are likely to result in the
greatest reduction in the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and
other drug problems in the future. Research evidence shows that
the greatest demonstrated effects from prevention programs have
come from those targeted toward 10- through 14-year old early
adolescents. All programs funded under this BAA must be targeted
solely toward direct services for 10- through 14-year old youth.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>7.With the limited available funds, it is necessary
to establish funding priorities that are likely to result in the
greatest reduction in the substance abuse prevalence per dollar
invested in prevention programs. Research evidence has shown the
greatest cost-benefit effect using &quot;prevention strategies&quot;
for programs targeted at populations that are at &quot;average
or moderate risk&quot; of developing future substance abuse problems.
Youth at &quot;low risk&quot; should be adequately served by school-based
programs, and those at &quot;highest risk&quot; should be served
with counseling, intervention, and treatment programs that are
better provided by managed care treatment professionals, rather
than prevention professionals.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>8.With the limited available funds, it is necessary
to establish funding priorities that eliminate or reduce program
overlaps and provide services that are not funded or required
to be funded by other sources. Indiana state law requires schools
to provide classroom instruction in drug prevention, and each
school corporation is eligible to receive funding from the Safe
and Drug-Free Schools Block Grant for school-based prevention
programs. All programs funded under this BAA must provide services
to targeted youth outside classroom settings and outside normal
school hours.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>9.Limited state funding should be reserved for providing
services to those in greatest need of financial assistance. The
funds allocated to each program funded under this BAA will be
based upon the number of targeted youth from households at or
below 200% of the federal poverty limits, which shall be operationally
defined as having total annual household incomes below $35,000.
Services should be made available to all youth in the target audience,
but DMH reimbursement will be limited to payment for &quot;targeted
youth&quot; completing each Services Program. Local funding or
user fees should pay for the participation of youth from households
with annual incomes in excess of $35,000. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>10.There is compelling research evidence that the
after-school hours present significant risk for the initiation
of substance-using behavior. Early adolescents who do not have
structured, adult-supervised activities in the after-school hours
are more than six times as likely to engage in substance-use as
those who have adult supervision. School vacation time also presents
significant risks. All programs funded under this BAA must address
the issue of adult-supervision of after-school activities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>11.Although early adolescents have a need for both
focused and unfocused activities, and structured and unstructured
recreation, the sources of DMH funds restrict their use to drug
prevention programs. DMH has given absolute priority to programs
that are focused and structured and that have an easily-identifiable
drug prevention component. All programs funded under this BAA
must include at least ten hours of focused and structured drug
prevention activities. DMH funding may be used to provide additional
hours of supportive drug prevention activities, provided that
at least ten hours of focused prevention activities are included.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Contractors and subcontractors are encouraged to
provide additional, locally-funded programming for participating
youth that may be unfocused and unstructured. For example, the
DMH-funded program may provide focused, structured activities
two afternoons per week, and a locally-funded program (at the
same site and time) could provide an unfocused, unstructured &quot;drop-in
center&quot; the other three afternoons.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>12.Early adolescents are a heterogeneous group that
include members with differing needs. For example, some youth
may have low self esteem and may need programs to enhance their
self concept, while other youth may have inflated egos that need
a &quot;reality check;&quot; some youth may excel at academics,
while others need assistance. Effective prevention programs must
be designed to meet individual as well as group needs. All programs
funded under this BAA must provide for youth and parent (or guardian)
participation in the development of an individualized prevention
plan that allows for the selection of optional, supportive prevention
activities that meet the needs and interests of each participating
youth. At least some of the optional activities must be developed
in consultation with participating youth and their families.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>13.Effective community-based prevention programs
are designed to complement, and not to duplicate or compete with
school-based programs. All programs funded under this BAA must
be based upon a community needs assessment that examines existing
school- and community-based programs and that complements them.
At a minimum, it is expected that all Local Coalitions assess
the strengths and weaknesses of existing programs and select strategies
and activities that do not duplicate those that are already adequately
provided in the community. Each Contractor shall consult with
the designated Local Coordinating Council and the Step Ahead Council
in each county in its designated service area when developing
the local needs assessment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>14.The federal enabling legislation that provides
the funds for this BAA requires that programs and services funded
supplement, and not supplant existing programs. This has been
interpreted to require that only new programs or services (or
significant capacity expansions of existing programs) can be funded.
Funding for existing programs may not be transferred to this BAA,
even if the funding for those programs is expiring. All programs
funded under this BAA must be new programs and/or services or
must provide significant expansions of the enrollment capacities
of existing programs, and must not supplant any program existing
as of the date on which this BAA was released.<BR>

<H3>Here's why mixing sex with partying isn't smart.</H3>

<TABLE BORDER=10%>
<TR>
<TD><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "aids1.gif"></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><B>&quot;He's very clean.&quot;      &quot;She comes from a good family.&quot;</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Maybe you go to a party where there are drugs and alcohol. Maybe you get high, and your thinking gets muddy.  That's when you do something stupid, something you wouldn't normally do, like have sex without a latex condom.</P>

<P>It's so easy to forget to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases when you aren't thinking clearly.  When your judgement is gone you may not even care that AIDS is fatal.</P>

<P>Maybe you rationalize away the problem:  "AIDS? Not her -- she comes from a good family."  Or, "Anyone can see he's clean-cut."  But you can't tell someone has HIV, the AIDS virus, just by looking.</P>

<P>It's tough to do the right thing, especially if you're high.  Even if you don't drink excessively or use drugs, you always need protection when you have sex.  As long as HIV can be passed sexually, sex with one person is like sex with all their previous partners.</P>

<P>It's a dilemma:  just when you want to let go, you need to hold back.  You need to keep a clear head.  How can you do that and still party?  The ideas on the following pages will help you handle situations where you want to have fun but don't want to get messed up by alcohol or other drugs.</P>

<H3>Strategies for safe partying.</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>People are practicing new ways to protect themselves.<BR>
Try a few, to find what works for you.</P>

"Hang out with people who don't take chances." -- Kris R.</P>

<P>"Plan <I>not </I>to get high and stick to it.  Do whatever it takes to help you remember."  -- Dan C.</P>

<P>"Don't have sex on a night you're partying." -- Chuck M.</P>

<P>"Party where you know people don't use drugs." -- Tony D.</P>

<P>"Believe in yourself, that's a real help." -- Salome B.</P>

<P>"Carry a condom, use a condom." -- Alicia Z.</P>

<P>"Don't forget to reward the designated driver." -- Sam F.</P>
</TD>
<TD><IMG SRC = "aids2.gif"></TD>
</TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD ALIGN=RIGHT><B>&quot;Carry a condom, use a condom."</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>



<H3>Learn you can depend on others by depending on others.</H3>

<P><I>The Buddy System </I>-- a big idea from Miami, FL. Team up with a friend.  Use a code word to remind each other when it's time to switch to soda or call it a night.</P>

<H3>What would you do?</H3>
<OL>
<LI>You're partying and you meet someone you like, do you --<BR>
a.  go home with the person immediately?<BR>
b. hang out and try to keep a clear head?<BR>
c. make a date for tomorrow to see the person in the sober light of day?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>  You're at a party that suddenly takes a turn for the worse, do you --<BR>
a. hang around to watch how bad things get?<BR>
b. find you can't leave because you stayed too long?<BR>
c. leave?
</OL>

<H3>Simple hints for keeping a clear head.</H3>
<P>
Don't drink excessively or use drugs.  <BR>
Eat something before partying. <BR>
Munch something during partying. <BR>
Less alcohol, more soda. <BR>
Add more ice.  Much more ice. <BR>
Sip slowly, don't gulp. <BR>
Avoid straws.<BR>
Give yourself a chance to see the person in the non-partying light of day. </P>

<H3>If getting high is part of the social and romantic fabric of your life, you can do better.</H3>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "aids3.gif"></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><B>Give yourself a chance to see the person<BR>
in the non-partying light of day.</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>A. No one needs to get high to be attrative to anyone else.</P>
<P>B. Figure out what you want from your social life.  Meet the person of your dreams?  Find someone to have fun with tomorrow?  Kick back, relax, hang out with a group?  Knowing what you want helps you  make the right choices. </P>
<P>C. Think about modifying your partying for a good time without putting yourself at risk. (A party situation isn't necessarily an out of control situation). </P>
<P>D. Talk openly with friends about what they do to keep from getting high and risking AIDS. </P>

<H3>Staying out of danger.</H3>

<b>7. Monthly use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, cigarettes, and heroin
by youth, ages 12-17.</b>
<p>
Significant progress in decreased rates of alcohol and other drug use seems
to have stopped in 1993.  Indiana students 12-17 years old report increased
use of cigarettes, marijuana, and inhalants, with little change in the
monthly use of alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs.  Use of heroin was not
statistically significant.

<P>Children like to imitate adults.  How many times have we found children imitating the way we speak?  Trying on our clothes or makeup?  Having a pretend tea party or cocktail party?  Dressing up to "go to work"?</P>

<P>To a child, being a grownup is a very desirable thing.  Being "grownup" means freedom.  Being "grownup" means making your own decisions.  Being "grownup" means being able to eat and drink anything you want.</P>

</CENTER>

<P>If we ask young people what messages we send about substance abuse, what might they say?  We might be surprised to find out just how grownup they feel when we ask them to get us a beer from the refrigerator or an ashtray from the cupboard.

A child can understand and accept that there are differences between what adults may do legally and what is appropriate and legal for children.  We want to continue to reinforce this understanding by not abusing legal substances or using illegal drugs.  Most kids are already pushed hard to act like grownups.  They see the advertisers appealing to this need on TV, radio, and billboards, etc.  We must try not to use these appeals in our own homes, clubs, and gathering places.</P>

<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Don't let your children be involved in your drinking</B> by helping you mix a drink or getting you a beer.  
<P>
<LI>Try to be a <B>good role model</B> by drinking responsibly and in moderation.  
<P>
<LI>When possible, <B>point out examples</B> of irresponsible drinking behavior and the consequences.

<LI>Your job is to <B>talk about these images and behaviors</B> and what they mean.  
You can even make this fun (See <A HREF = "exer1.html">Exercise 1</A>).
</OL>

<P>We must keep in mind that <B>we need to "let" our children grow up</B>.  Some of the ways children behave are part of a natural and healthy separation, which generally starts between ages 11-14.  The harder we hold on and pull in the reins, the more they may want us to let go.  In most cases, giving children more independence can actually help deter them from using alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs simply because they feel grownup and mature. Many times the first experimentation with tobacco takes place at the precise time a child is requesting greater freedom.</P>

<P>We need to keep more freedom separate from more time left to experiment with drugs.  If we attempt to control our children and do not allow them independence, we may actually make the problem worse.</P>

If you are a parent, try not to let your feelings be hurt and remember that your child will respect you more in the long run if you encourage them to talk to someone else if that is what they want.  He or she probably will come back to you with concerns when he or she is older.  At times an aunt, uncle, sibling, coach, or religious leader may be a more objective sounding board for your child.</EM></P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Using Alcohol, Tobacco, or Illicit Drugs</H2>

<P>The fact is, if you use alcohol, tobacco products, or illicit drugs, your children are more likely to use them too.  However, even if you use these substances, you can do a lot to make sure that your children don't.</P>

<H3>Action Steps</H3>

<OL>
<LI><B>If you use alcohol,</B> drink moderately and refrain from always drinking for celebrations and holidays.  Learn other  ways to celebrate.  Try to deal with stress without tossing down a few drinks.  Try exercise, talking with a friend, or deep breathing, for instance.  Allow yourself a "time out" from your regular routine.  The children you care for will learn a lot by imitating these coping strategies.
<P>
Set aside a few minutes a day to talk about family, love, and life problems that might have come up during the day and discuss how you handled them.  You can even ask children for their ideas.  This does not mean burdening them with difficult problems or financial worries.  But you can ask children for their ideas on simple matters and help them to build problem-solving skills.  This skill will help them resist peer pressure to use alcohol and drugs to solve their problems.
<P>
<LI><B>If you use tobacco products</B> and have had difficulty stopping, talk with your children about how addictive nicotine is.  Let them know that when you were young, you thought you could stop easily but you have grown dependent on nicotine.
<P>
<LI>If your children are very young, you will want to be careful about sharing information about the health problems you may be suffering as a result of your smoking or chewing dependence.  A young child may quickly jump to the conclusion that you are dying and may become very frightened.
<P>
On the other hand, your children will be hearing a lot about these health problems when they get to school, so avoid downplaying your health problems.  If you lose your child's trust, you will have lost something precious.  And, it will be difficult to teach the lesson that your child should always try to tell the truth, regardless of the consequences.
<P>
<LI><B>If you are abusing prescription drugs,</B> you may be giving the message, "Take a pill.  This is how you cope."  Remember that your children know you very well.  At some point they will KNOW that you are abusing these drugs.  It will probably startle them.  It may take them a little while to talk with you about this.  But when they do, try to be receptive.
<P>
<B>If you use illicit drugs,</B> frequently or even occasionally, you are sending strong negative messages to children.  These may include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>It's okay to break the law when it stands in the way of personal needs.
<P>
<LI>The best way to cope with stress, strain, or other problems is to use drugs.
<P>
<LI>Happiness comes from the temporary high of drug use, not from good relationships with others.
<P>
<LI>It's easier to take drugs than to develop good problem-solving and stress management skills.
<P>
<LI>My priority is my drug-taking, not you.
<P>
<LI>Money that could be spent on necessities or legitimate entertainment is better spent on drugs.
<P>
<LI>Time spent using drugs is better than time spent with loved ones.
<P>
<LI>If a person doesn't value himself/herself very much, drugs are the answer.
<P>
<LI>It's easier to take drugs to try and forget problems instead of dealing with them.
<P>
</UL>
</OL>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H2>If You Used Drugs in the Past...</H2>

<P>What's really important here is the value of having a face-to-face discussion with a young person about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.  Read the conversation over several times to make sure you understand the purpose of it. It does not have to be, nor should it be, recited word-for-word. Most important are the principles involved:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Listening.
<LI>Slowing down the dialogue.
<LI>Eliciting feedback between each segment.
<LI>Establishing your agenda and communicating it so that a child will hear it and not shut you off.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Example</STRONG>

<P>The 12-year-old you care for comes home from school and says, pretty matter-of-factly, "I learned about drugs today.  The teacher said that lots of people your age used to do drugs.  Did you?"</P>

<P>(You have many opportunities here.  Your child, in asking this question, is providing a chance for you to develop your listening skills in addition to answering his/her question, so try not to react too quickly.  It's understandable that a question about your own drug history would make you uncomfortable, but let's see what might be possible here.)</P>

<P><B>You might say:</B> Wow, you're learning about drugs already?  What are they teaching you?</P>

<P><B>Child:</B> Well, just about drugs and alcohol, and the teacher said a lot of people your age used drugs when they were young.</P>

<P><B>You might say:</B> Well, I'm not sure what your teacher meant to say, but I can tell you what I know about those times.  Would you like me to?  (The parent/caregiver offers a choice here, because some kids might prefer to keep their knowledge general and not specific to their parent/caregiver.  Others, of course, will forge on.)</P>

<P><B>Child:</B> Sure.</P>

<P><B>You might say:</B> Well, many people my age, who were young adults back then, tried marijuana.  We mostly called it pot.  But we didn't know as much about it as we do now.  It was the same with cigarettes.  We didn't think smoking was very harmful either.  So do you still want to know if I smoked marijuana?  Think about your answer.  How will you feel if I say yes?</P>

<P><EM>(By now, the conversation may be opening up.)</EM></P>

<P><B>Child:</B> I'll have to think about it.  Well, yes and no.  Yes, because you always say it's important to be honest.  No, because I'm not sure what I'll think about you.  If you say no, you'll just be a regular parent.  If you say yes, I don't know, that would be kind of weird.</P>

<P><B>You might say:</B> You're exactly right.  That's why I wanted you to think about it.  But remember, whatever you decide is okay, and whatever my answer is, we can talk more about it.</P>

<P><EM>(Many opportunities have opened between you and your child even prior to your answering the original question.  That's more than half the battle in helping kids resist drugs and alcohol—a strong parental connection, even if a sometimes rocky one, always helps the child.)</EM></P>

<P><B>Child:</B> Are you just trying not to tell me?</P>

<P><B>You:</B> No, I'm trying to be thoughtful about how I answer you so I'll know more about what you think about my drug usage.</P>

<P><B>Child: So you did?</B></P>

<P><B>You:</B> Yes, I tried it.  A couple of times because friends of mine were doing it.  And then I stopped because I decided it just wasn't a good thing to do.</P>

<P><EM>(It's important to make a distinction between past adolescent or young adult use/experimentation and current adult usage.  You should not divulge current use unless directly confronted by the child.  You should seek help for yourself and the child in dealing with this situation.)</EM></P>

<P><B>You:</B> So what do you think?</P>

<P><B>Child:</B> About what?</P>

<P><B>You:</B> About my saying I used it but then stopped.</P>

<P><B>Child:</B> Oh, it's okay.  I don't know.</P>

<P><B>You:</B> Are you wondering if I would give you permission or think it's okay to use drugs because I tried them?</P>

<P><B>Child:</B> Well if you tried them, what's the big deal?</P>

<P><B>You:</B> Well, whether or not I used is not the main issue here.  The main issue is you.  I definitely do not want you to use alcohol, marijuana, or any other illicit drugs.  I'm not going to give you a lecture about how bad they are for you because you've  probably come to learn a lot about them in class.  But, I want you to think about this:  you—plain and simple-don't need them.  You have too much going for you.  Drugs don't really help anything.  They don't solve problems.  They won't make you popular.  They won't help you grow up.  And they surely won't help you build a strong body and mind.  In fact, just the opposite can happen.  Now go ahead and get ready for soccer practice-that's something that makes you feel good about yourself.</P>

<P>Obviously, this conversation could go a number of ways.  But the point is to really listen.  Make it clear that you value this young person and believe that he or she has the right to talk with you about anything AND that you do NOT want him or her to use alcohol or illicit drugs.</P>

<P>Children want others to like them.  Sometimes the group they want to join is using—or the child thinks the group is using—alcohol, smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, sniffing inhalants, smoking pot, taking LSD, using methamphetamines, smoking crack, or even shooting heroin.  Sometimes kids turn to alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs to feel like they fit in—to overcome anxiety, change their personality, or give themselves courage to talk to other people.</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "parent21.jpg" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>Drug abuse is everywhere.  The names of the drugs may change from place to place (see page 37), but the related problems all remain the same.  In the United States, from 5 to 10 million young people, between the ages of 12-17 are using alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.  This represents as many as half of all kids this age.</P>

<P>Our society is flooded with messages that, perhaps unintentionally, encourage us and our young people to use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs to enhance our lives and develop social skills....  If you want to celebrate, don't do it without alcohol.  If you want to be pretty and thin, just pop some speed.  If you want your music to be cool, just smoke a little marijuana.  If you want an instant escape, just sniff some glue.</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "potkids1.gif" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>These images help convince young people that they, too, should join "the crowd."  Join the drug  parade.  Sing praises to the blunt.*  Become part of the buzzed and beautiful.</P>

<P>Wanting to fit in and belong is one of the most natural parts of growing up.  It is important.  In fact, if we really listen, we may find that for some it is THE most important part of growing up.</P>

<P>Establishing a clear position against alcohol and other drug use is not enough.  Children need a repertoire of skills to help them.  They need to learn how to:  decipher pro-use messages, refuse both subtle and direct offers of alcohol and drugs, act appropriately in social situations, build solid interpersonal relationships, express their thoughts and feelings, solve problems, make decisions, and communicate with people in positions of authority.</P>

<P>So, how do we help? How do we prevent our young people from hanging around with those who seem to need to use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs?</P>

<H3>Action Steps</H3>

<OL>
<LI><B>Help your child deal with peer pressure.</B>  Even though young people often report that they learn more from friends when they reach adolescence, studies have found that these same adolescents would PREFER to learn about a variety of important topics from their parents or other caring adults.  Peer influence does increase during the teen years, but the influence of caring adults can remain strong if you've established a strong relationship during the earlier years.
<P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=40% BORDER=5%>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
<TH><EM>A Supportive Caregiving Pattern Includes:</EM></TH>
<P>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<EM><LI>Strong acceptance of the child
<P>
<LI>High expectations for appropriate behavior 
<P>
<LI>Strong responsiveness to the child
<P>
<LI>Strong positive involvement with the child, e.g., in planned activities
<P>
<LI>Solid guidance</EM>
<P>
</UL>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>Parents, grandparents, elders, aunts and uncles, foster parents, guardians, mentors, and others can play a strong role in helping young people face pressures to use alcohol and drugs.  In fact, not wanting to harm the relationship between themselves and the caring adults in their lives is the most common reason that young people give for not using alcohol and drugs.</P>

<P>Therefore, establishing a clear wish that you, as a caring adult, do not want them to use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs provides the strongest motivation for them to refuse offers to try these substances.</P>

<P>Most peer pressure for young people is just as subtle as it is for most adults.  For example, let's say you just started a lowfat diet and you've been out playing cards with your friends.  They've been eating chips and dip, but you're really proud that you've been snacking away on raw vegetables.  It's time to go and as you drive home with your neighbor, she says, "Hey, let's stop off at the pizza place down the block."  You mutter something about being on a diet and she says, "Oh come on, just one piece of pizza won't kill you."  This is peer pressure, and it's the same as what a child experiences when a slightly older pal suggests just taking a "little" hit because he knows that this kid really doesn't want to do drugs.  He's going to show some respect by offering just a "little."  No big thing.</P>

<P>This is why practicing resisting peer pressure is important. (See <A HREF = "exer2.html">Exercise 2</A>)<P>
<P>
<LI><B> Help your child act appropriately in social situations. </B>  A basic course in general manners often helps here.  And, again it's a matter of practicing.  Young people want to be socially acceptable.  And, if being socially acceptable means eating with a knife and fork instead of with one's hands, then that's what kids want to learn.
<P>
<P>Practice in meeting and greeting people also is very helpful.  Teaching young people some sentences that help them "break the ice" with others will help.</P>

<P>Teaching children how to ask questions about others and to be good listeners also will help shape their social skills. (See <A HREF = "exer3.html">Exercise 3</A>)</P>

<P>Again, you can get lots of input from your child to help with this important task.  Ask them when they feel awkward.  Tell them about a situation in which you felt awkward and see if they have ideas for dealing with the situation in the future.  Let them know that social situations often are awkward at first and that they are not very easy for most people.  Ask them about their experiences.</P>

<P>Let them know that some people turn to alcohol and drugs to get them through awkward social moments, but then they don't get to practice this skill, and postponing it only makes it harder.  Let them know that it's okay to feel awkward at times.  We all do!</P>

<LI><B>Help your child build solid relationships.</B>  Young people today are raised by a variety of different caregivers, such as grandparents, foster parents, coaches, and mentors, in a variety of settings.

<P>Because of the tenuousness of many adult relationships that they see, young people may find it difficult to believe that relationships can be counted on to meet their needs.  But that doesn't mean that they don't want to believe this—they do.  They want the security of thinking that whatever relationships they have are solid, that they are going to last, and that they can count on other people in their lives.  Your relationship with them can give them this assurance.</P>

<P>Value them, seek their input, and make your expectations clear as your child grows up.  Hopefully, they understand that your love will always be there for them.  They are going to test that premise over and over again until they are very sure that you mean it.</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "parent22.jpg" HSPACE=15>
<P>

<P>You can teach them that all relationships are important, but that some relationships are very special and require hard work.  How you handle a divorce in terms of recognizing how difficult and complicated it is for everyone involved, for instance, will teach your child a lot about relationships.  How you acknowledge that relationships encompass a wide range of human emotions—from joy to pain—also will teach your child a lot.  How you acknowledge and accept the important people in his or her life also will teach a lot about relationships.  </P>

<P>(Remember that you are going to be tested.  "Love me, love my friend" may be one of those tests.  Instead of letting out a war cry, try to find out what is valuable about these people from the child's point of view.  This can help you identify the traits he or she is seeking in others.  Then you can help your child develop those traits rather than living vicariously through inappropriate role models.  If, on the other hand, you choose to criticize your child's friends, they may end up feeling worse about themselves, and you may drive them to spend even more time with those who may not have their best interests at heart.)</P>
<P>Again, building solid relationships requires practice.  It's not something you necessarily get right the first time.  There are lots of ups and downs, even in the best relationships.</P>

<TH><EM>Being a Mentor</EM></TH>
</TR>

<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
<TD><P><EM>Mentors provide support and encouragement, serve as positive role models, and help those they choose to mentor recognize their own potential and set positive goals. Parents are often good mentors, but many people in a child's life can serve as mentors such as coaches, teachers, doctors, and religious or community leaders.</P>

<P>If you are thinking about being a mentor to a child, here are some things to consider:  </P>

<P>Make a commitment for a specific period of time.  You can extend it later, but this way you won't disappoint the child if you are only able to commit for the short-term.</P>

<P>Be very clear about what the child can expect from you.</P>

<P>Ask the child if the arrangement is okay with him/her.  If not, respect the answer and try to work out a reasonable solution.</P></EM>

</CENTER>


<P>All children need to learn how to take risks.  This is part of growing up.  By his or her actions, the child is often saying, "I'm going to take an emotional risk today by letting someone know that I don't like what they are doing."  Or, "I'm going to take a risk today to test my balance by climbing up this tree." Or, "I'm going to take a social risk today and go up to someone I don't know and introduce myself."</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH=45% BORDER=5%>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
<TH><EM>Evaluating Risk</EM></TH>
</TR>
<TR ALIGN=CENTER>
<TD><EM><P>From a very early age, most parents, grandparents, and providers have a strong sense of the level of risk-taking for each child in their care.  You may be familiar with parents who had to call a poison control center five times in 1 year for one child and never had any cause for concern with another.  Some children put everything in their mouths, climb up to the highest cabinet, and can't be trusted for 3 minutes alone in the backyard.  Others seem to be born with an innate sense of responsibility and caution.  You can probably tell your child's level of risk.  This will be helpful in determining the activities that most appeal to his or her sense of fun and pushing the limits.</P>

<P>There are risks of all kinds that we take every day—and, we take more when we are young.  We want to push the limits.</P>
</TD></EM>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>To grow, a child must learn a lot of skills that we as adults often take for granted. It's difficult for us to remember how hard it was to go to our first dance. We had to risk that no one would ask us to dance, that we would not be able to dance very well, and that someone would make fun of us. For a child, these are big risks to take.</P>

<P>And as children approach puberty, virtually everything holds a small amount of risk because everything feels so new and unexplored. As greater levels of risks are achieved, most young people will continue to look for opportunities to expand their horizons and grow.</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "parent03.jpg" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>This is why drugs and alcohol hold such allure for some young people. When all other reasons are discounted, drugs may provide some kids with the chance to prove they "can handle it." Combined with a strong desire to be a grownup and images of people on TV and elsewhere drinking, smoking, and taking drugs, it's no small wonder some kids want to take this risk.</P>

<P>Some youth, however, take more risks than others.  They are unclear about the boundaries.  They may be unsure of rules and expectations.  If they have an idea that they want to try everything in life and are not clearly guided into making smart and healthy decisions about these risks, they may think it's okay to include using alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs as part of that risk-taking.</P>

<P>If the child has this kind of temperament, we can help them find ways to test their limits.  This might include involving them in outdoor programs with leaders who will help them climb mountains, cross streams on a rope, or otherwise push them physically.  We can also charge them to apply their risk-taking skills to social, emotional, and intellectual situations instead of daredevil type stunts.</P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H3>Action Steps</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Again, this is a time to <B>get lots of input from your child</B>.  It's okay to talk about risk-taking and what it means.  Ask them what it means to them.  Talk with them about all types of risk-taking and the advantages and disadvantages    associated with each one.  Kids and parents both need to acknowledge the consequences of risk-taking.
<P>
<LI>There are some children who seem to NEED lots of sensation or thrills in their lives.  They like loud noises.  They need a lot of stimulation to keep their attention.  They seem to thrive on chaos.  These young people are at particularly high risk for alcohol and other drug problems.  You may want to <B>seek the help of a professional</B> if you believe that your child may have this type of temperament.  There may be biological reasons as well as psychological reasons for this high sensation-seeking or thrill-seeking behavior.
<P>
<LI>And, there are also some young people who really want to rebel against society by engaging in antisocial behavior, juvenile delinquency, treating others poorly, and so forth.  These young people often have not received the warmth and acceptance they needed while growing up.  Children who experience rejection from their parents or other caretakers also appear to be at greater risk than other children for alcohol or drug   problems.  In addition, parents who have unrealistic expectations about their children's abilities, communicate with them in abusive ways (threatening, chastising, belittling, and criticizing), and use coercive limit-setting and disciplinary methods may increase the likelihood that their children will use alcohol or illicit drugs.
</OL>

<P>Research also suggests that <B>supportive parenting</B> patterns have the opposite effect.  Parents who are warm and accepting, who express realistic expectations about their children's abilities, who are diligent and effective in supervising and monitoring children, whose limit-setting methods are noncoercive, and who spend time with their children, are much less likely to raise children who use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.</P>

<TD><P>Teenagers feel almost immortal.  Although they worry about what their friends think about them and about who is going to say what about them at the cafeteria table, they don't believe they are physically in much danger in the world.  Because one of their growing up tasks is to become individuals and separate from their families, they often become involved in risk-taking behavior.  This behavior may get them into trouble, but it also may help them learn to face the world as mature adults.  Here is where we face a dilemma: how can we help them take the risks without encouraging dangerous—even life-threatening—behavior?</P>

<P>Drug abuse is a risk for today's youngsters that existed on a much smaller scale in past generations.  They <B>must</B> take risks of some kind to learn their own boundaries.  But we must convince them that using alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs is not an <B>acceptable</B> risk-taking behavior.</P></EM>

</CENTER>


<P>The main point of this exercise is to have some fun with the child in your care and allow him or her the opportunity to play an unfamiliar role.  Role playing involves performing, which is a risk-taking experience for many of us uncomfortable with that notion!  You can either have a one-on-one role play or you can involve your whole family in the experience.  The fun comes in determining who plays which part.  For example, you might have the child play the parental role while you play the part of the child.  You could make the topic one that relates to several of the themes in this book:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>peer pressure (you play the drug user) to test how the child would respond in this situation
<P>
<LI>the child (you) asking about why he/she should stay away from alcohol  and drugs
<P>
<LI>the parent (the child) giving advice on what it means to be a grown up

<CENTER><IMG SRC = "parent06.gif"><H1>Exercise 1</H1><H4>Dealing With Messages That Promote the Use of Alcohol, Tobacco, or Illicit Drugs</H4><IMG SRC = "parent06.gif"></CENTER><P>Children see many images on television, in the media, and elsewhere that give them misleading ideas of what it means to be a grownup.</P><P>This exercise can help children correctly interpret these messages.  Beginning at a very early age, we can ask a child to answer a set of questions.  We can take opportunities to talk about this whenever we can.  We might see someone smoking on the street, or a scene on TV where someone's taking drugs, or a billboard promoting beer.  If the subject doesn't come up naturally, we can prompt a discussion about it.  Here are some guidelines:</P><P><UL><LI>Don't lecture. Talk WITH the child.<P><LI>Ask questions.<P><LI>Give feedback and positive support.<P><LI>Don't label people as bad or good only their behavior.  Drug use, for  instance, is bad, but a drug abuser is not a bad person.  Make the  distinction.</UL><P>Here are some questions to start the discussion:</P><P><OL><LI>Is that advertisement trying to sell you something?  If so, what?<P><LI>Is that product healthy for you?<P><LI>In addition to these, we can begin to ask more sophisticated questions  as the child gets older: <P><LI>How is the sponsor of that product trying to get you to purchase it?<P>a. By making you feel unlovable (e.g., you won't be liked very much if you don't buy this product);<P>b. By making you feel left out (e.g., everybody else is buying this product so you should, too, or you'll be left out of the "cool" crowd);<P>c. By making you feel inadequate or unsuccessful (e.g., if you don't buy this product, you won't be able to do this or that as well as everyone else); and<P>d. By making you feel less masculine or less feminine (e.g., if you don't drink this product, you're a wimp, or if you don't use this product, you won't be beautiful).<P><LI>How did you feel about being manipulated by that message?</UL><P>These questions can lead to other discussions about circumstances where young people might be trying to pressure each other to do something they don't want to do.</P><CENTER><IMG SRC = "parent06.gif"><P>Return to <A HREF = "feel.html">Section Related to this Exercise</A><BR>Return to <A HREF = "keepmenu.html">Table of Contents</A><BR>

</CENTER>

<P>Let's face it.  How many times have we said or heard our friends say,   "Gee, I'm glad I'm not a kid growing up today.  It's really tough out there."</P>

<P>What do we think is meant by saying that?</P>

<P>There is a lot in the environment that makes it difficult for kids today such as:</P>
<P><UL>
<LI>More violence and gangs
<P>
<LI>Economic pressures
<P>
<LI>HIV and AIDS
<P>
<LI>Changing family structures
<P>
<LI>Easy access to alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs
<P>
<LI>Lack of good role models
<P>
<LI>More teen pregnancies
<P>
<LI>Many more multimedia influences
<P>
<LI>Less security about the future
</UL>

<P>These are all factors that may contribute to the new upturn in drug abuse in this country.  Some young people think that alcohol or illicit drugs will cheer them up or make them forget about problems they have.</P>

<P>Adults and children sometimes develop unhealthy ways of dealing with stress.  How many times have we heard people say, "Boy, I could use a drink," as an antidote to stress?  How many of us truly know how to deal with stress in healthy ways?  Children need to learn how to deal with stress, how to make healthy decisions, and how to relax. </P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC = "parent98.jpg" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>Children also need someone to help guide them through difficult times, someone to whom they can express their concerns and apprehensions  without fear of rejection or recrimination.  One of the most important things that can keep children away from alcohol and drugs is the love and support of at least one caring adult who mentors them through the many phases of childhood.</P>

<P>It may sound like a cliché, but children need a lot of support from a wide range of people who can spend quality time with them and who can listen and be involved in their life experiences.  Children need to talk about their friendships and about their need to fit in and belong.  They need to be able to discuss their fears and their successes.  They need to know that they will not be negatively judged—only the behavior that harms themselves or others.</P>

</CENTER>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Express Thoughts and Feelings</H2>

<P>Most of us would probably agree that we feel much better when we are free of troubling worries and concerns. Being able to express thoughts and feelings with someone we feel comfortable with—whether it be a spouse, a coworker, or a friend—can make all the difference in how we feel about ourselves and in how we interact with the world around us.</P>

<P>Similarly, young people try on new thoughts and new feelings.  Being able to express thoughts and feelings is the essence of our being human and what differentiates us from animals.  When we try to limit the thoughts and feelings of our children, we are taking a great deal away from them.  When we deny that their feelings are real, we are denying that children are individuals with their own perceptions. Young people who are taught to express themselves are going to have an easier time dealing with peer pressure and resisting other temptations.</P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "blah.gif" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>Always telling someone to shut up or silencing them by never paying any attention to their thoughts and feelings could sever their connection to you.  They are likely to either rebel, hide out, or get even.  We've all heard stories about young people who are ignored, abandoned, or rejected.  They hurt and they express their pain through anger.  They revert to violence or other forms of acting out.  Or they repress all of their feelings and choose to comfort themselves through alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.</P>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H3>Action Steps</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>You can <B>teach your child how to express their thoughts and feelings by using figures on TV.</B>  Ask them if they feel the way that so-and-so does.  Ask him or her about these feelings.  You can read stories from the newspaper and ask if your child has any thoughts about the story or the characters.
<P>
<LI>Many families <B>use the dinner or supper hour as a time to share</B> stories about events or to discuss current affairs.  Be aware, however, that this time should be limited to positive discussion.  It is probably not appropriate to discuss upsetting issues such as failing grades, bad news in the newspaper, or other scary topics.  It is definitely not the time to be fighting with each other.  
<P>
Digesting food is an important bodily function that should be respected.  Sometimes children associate food with the unpleasantness that may arise at the dinner table and may develop poor eating habits.  After dinner discussions can teach a lot about the value of expressing yourself by encouraging passionate exchanges of words.  You can make clear that it is your expectation that no one will use any violence or curse words and you can set standards for these discussions.</P>
</OL>

<HR NOSHADE>
<H2>Make wise decisions/solve problems</H2>

<H3>Action Steps</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Children need to be taught <B>how to make decisions</B>.  You can guide them through a set of questions:
<P>
What am I trying to decide and what do I know about it?</P>
<P>
How do I know my information is accurate?  Who told me about it?</P>

<P>What more do I need to know before going ahead?</P>

<P>Who has the information I need?</P>

<LI>And once the decision is made ask these questions:

<P>What are the good effects of this decision?</P>

<P>What are the bad effects?</P>

<P>After this, you can ask the child to reconsider his or her decision and take responsibility for the consequences.</P>
</OL>

<H3>Example</H3>

<P>The child is asked if he or she wants to smoke marijuana.</P>

<P>You can practice the decisionmaking process with the child under your care.  Ask:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>What do you know about marijuana?

<P>If he or she doesn't know much about marijuana, you could take a trip to the local library for information.  You can also contact the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at 1-800-729-6686.  Internet: telnet ncadi.health.org or http://www.health.org</P>
<P>
<LI>What else do you need to know?

<P>You can state that marijuana is illegal and use may cause him or her to be suspended from school.  A conviction of possession might hamper his or her job opportunities.</P>

<P>Or you can say that you disapprove of its use and he or she will be disappointing you by smoking pot.</P>

<P>Or, while he or she may temporarily feel like part of the crowd, true friendship doesn't depend on whether one goes along with everything everyone else does.</P>

<P>Or, while there are some young people who smoke pot, most young people do not.</P>
</OL>

<P>Marijuana may give temporary good feelings, but it often leads to decreased interest in primary areas of life.  Instead of building up his or her talents—cooking, sports, gardening, carpentry, music, auto repair, beading, dancing, acting—he or she gets caught up in the drug culture.  Youth is a time for learning new things...  finding friends and building support networks.  A child needs to know that drugs can interfere with all of this.</P>

<P>A child also needs to know that drug use doesn't just have a negative effect on him or her.  It can also have a negative effect on others.  A teacher may grow tired of increased absences or lethargy or a grandparent may grow resentful that a favorite grandchild no longer visits.</P>

<P>You might point out that behaviors like these can turn into a bad cycle.  The child may think that his teacher or favorite uncle doesn't like him anymore instead of realizing that his behavior (drug use) has changed the relationship.  The child, without being able to see this, just says, "The heck with it.  Nobody likes me anyway."  This attitude begins to spread to other relationships and then serves as a primary defense for using he drugs—"Nobody cares about me, so why shouldn't I smoke pot?"</P>

<P>One of the primary differences between kids from the sixties generation and today's generation is a change in the composition of our neighborhoods.  In the 1960's and 1970's, there were more extended families.  The teacher, the minister, the banker, the corner grocery owner, the neighbors, and others took responsibility for helping to ensure that any child in that neighborhood stayed out of trouble.  And young people didn't want to violate these relationships.  We need more of these influences for our young people today.</P>

<P>You can certainly share the information provided in this section with your children, but you may find it useful for them to gather some information on their own.  Doing so may give them additional ownership of the information and may prompt them to learn even more as a result.</P>

<P>The first bit of information you could share with them is 1-800-729-6686—the number for the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI).  (Internet: telnet ncadi.health.org or http://www.health.org)  NCADI can provide them with information on the various drug groups.  NCADI can also provide information on community  organizations in your area that offer additional materials, volunteer possibilities, and other resources.</P>

<P>Offer to show your child the devastating effects of substance abuse—take him/her to a local treatment center, visit areas of your community plagued by drug problems, arrange to visit a police station and talk to some of the officers.</P>

<P>There are several videos available on substance abuse prevention, many through NCADI.  Offer your child the resources to obtain some of them or help them look for them at a local library or on the Internet.</P>

<P>You and your child will probably find many resources available to you when you begin to look.  But if you are having trouble finding them, there are several national organizations that offer free materials and resources.  Please refer to the resources section of this guide to give you a head start.</P>

<p>
<b>11. Average cost of street drugs.</b>
<p>
<p>
The Indiana Criminal Justics Institute began a system for multi-jurisdictional
task forces to report street costs of illicit drugs, using data from 
undercover buys.  This data does not account for purity or volume of purchase.  
A report listing task force purchases and dollar values is available.
<p>
<table border=3>
<tr><th>  </th><th>Cocaine</th><th>Cannabis</th><th>Crack</th><th>Hallucinogens*</th><th>Depressants*</th></tr>
<tr><td> 1993 2nd qtr</td><td>$79.58</td><td>$8.12</td><td>$68.41</td><td>$5.00/du</td><td>$3.45/du</td></tr>
<tr><td> 1994 1st qtr</td><td>$79.83</td><td>$6.49</td><td>$166.94</td><td>$7.71/du</td><td>$3.66/du</td></tr>
<tr><td> 1994 2nd qtr</td><td>$86.21</td><td>$4.62</td><td>$100.00</td><td>$5.00/du</td><td>**</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
* Measured in dosage units which may vary according to application and task force reporting.
<p>
** Only two task forces reported, rendering the data insignificant.

<P>Being responsible for or to a child is the most important job any of us in our community will ever have.  It's both difficult <B>and</B> rewarding.</P>

<P>Children are wonderful <B>and</B> they can be hard to be with. They want our attention but complain we are watching them too closely. For example, if their hair is curly, they want it straight; if they are short, they want to be tall!</P>

<P>As difficult as our job can be, as a parent, guardian, or caregiver we are helping young people to become adults who will, in turn, be parents, uncles/aunts, caregivers, employees, friends, neighbors, followers, leaders, and responsible members of the community.  Our support and influence help determine the adult a child turns out to be.</P>

<P><EM><B>Keeping Youth Drug-Free</EM></B> has been prepared in response to what caregivers and young people say about working together to resist all the pressures to use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.  It is geared to the parents, guardians, and other role models of 7- to 13-year- olds, but the material and exercises can also work for different age groups.</P>

<P>This guide is divided into five sections, based on the five reasons that the young people gave for using alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs-to feel grownup, to fit in and belong, to relax and feel good, to take risks and rebel, and to satisfy curiosity.  Every section provides background on each reason, information on how adults can help, and exercises to share with children.  </P>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "parent02.jpg" HSPACE=15>
<P>
<P>If you presently use alcohol, or even if you once tried marijuana or other illegal substances, this guide provides information you can use to help steer children away from them.</P>

<P>It must seem like "What's the big deal with all this drug stuff?  The kid I care about is only 9 years old."  But what we hear from young people is that it's never too early to start talking with children about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.  If we say nothing, they might easily assume that alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use must be okay for them. </P>

<P>The suggestions in this guide are just that—suggestions.  The information presented gives guiding principles for communicating with youth.  You will want to translate this information into your own words and use your own style in communicating it.</P>

<P>We can all work together to help children make good decisions and enjoy a safe and healthy childhood and adolescence.  Our job requires understanding, patience, lots of love, and practice, practice, practice!</P>

<TD>Way to go!  That's great.<BR>
I think you have real talent.<BR>
This shows you really understand.<BR>
Do you know how good this is?<BR>
You've made real progress.<BR>
See?  Hard work really pays off.<BR>
Is this the very first time you did this?  Congratulations.<BR>
I can't wait to show this to....<BR>
That is a whole new way of thinking about it... good.<BR>
Can you tell me how you did it?<BR>
I like the way you did that.<BR>
I'm proud of you.<BR>
You are a natural....<BR>
I knew you could do it!<BR>
Aren't you proud of yourself?<BR>
You are a quick learner.<BR>
Well done!<BR>
That part is perfect.<BR>
That is a good solution.<BR>
You are really creative.<BR>
You have great control.<BR>
Good job!<BR>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH=35%
<P>No one is ever too old to hear some strong words of praise or get a hug or a high five for a job well done.  Keep in mind though that kids usually know when their effort has yielded a mediocre result.  Choose words that will be accepted as authentic.</P>

<H1>Exercise 3</H1>
<H4>Building Social Skills</H4>
<IMG SRC = "parent06.gif">
</CENTER>

<P>Offer the young person some exercises to make him or her feel more at ease and comfortable in social situations.</P>

<P>If he is going to a party or dance, have him set a goal of meeting two or three new people—no more than that.  Goals should be kept within reach.</P>

<P>Teach your child how to break the ice with people, e.g., by saying, "I've heard that you:  just came back from a trip to.... like alternative music... etc."  Encourage them to say what they think about or feel about these topics.</P>

<P>Have her go to a new place with a friend.  No one needs to try to do everything alone.  The key is to not just stay together the whole time.  Each of them might try to meet one other person and come back later to share the stories about the interesting person each has met.  (By the way, almost everyone is interesting in their own way.  It's fun to see if we can find out about the very interesting part of each person we meet!)</P>

<P>If the child whom you care for happens to be very shy (or extremely aggressive) and you are having difficulty teaching them how to cope well socially, you may want to seek help.  Social skills are very important for navigating through the stormy adolescent years.</P>

<H1>Exercise 2</H1>
<H4>Resisting Peer Pressure</H4>
<IMG SRC = "parent06.gif">
</CENTER>

<P>Finding creative ways to refuse alcohol, tobacco, and drugs requires humor and lots of practice.  Each child can help develop his or her own favorite set of "turn down" comments, but it's your job to help them practice these so that they are not thrown off balance if the offer is more subtle or more direct than what was anticipated.</P>

<P>A lot of this will depend on the age and temperament of the child, and the most important thing is to make sure the child is comfortable with what he or she wants to say.  Your job is to coach them to use language and phrases that they come up with themselves.</P>

<HR NOSHADE WIDTH=60%>
<P>For instance:</P>

<P>A shy child might want to say, "No, thanks," or "I gotta go," and then walk away quickly.</P>

<P>A more outgoing child might say, "What? Are you talking to me?  Forget it," or "No, I don't do drugs."</P>
<HR NOSHADE WIDTH=60%>

<P>You may need to help an angry child come up with something that doesn't needlessly antagonize someone, especially if there is danger of violence involved.</P>

<P>A child who has difficulty refusing offers from older kids or adults may need special help in practicing a forceful and believable reason that clearly lets the other party know that he or she does not want to use alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.</P>

</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
The younger the child, the more practice he or she will need.  But, this cannot be a one-time session.  You might find, for instance, that a 10-year-old has no trouble whatsoever saying no to a suggestion that he try a beer at a neighbor's house.  However, 3 years later when the 17-year-old next door asks him if he wants a beer, you hear him hesitate—not so sure of himself and his convictions at 13 as he was at the age of 10.

<P>Finding support for yourself and the child in your care is an important task.  And besides being a great help to you, it shows your child that asking for help and becoming part of a larger community is important.  Talk to other people who work with kids, find out about local prevention groups or support programs in your area, or look into starting a parents' group.</P>

<P>Young people are being exposed to alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs early on—even in elementary school.  The younger someone starts to use alcohol and drugs, the more likely he or she is to develop problems associated with such use.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Young people who use alcohol and drugs also are more likely to be victims or perpetrators of violence, engage in unplanned and unprotected sex, experience school failure, or be seriously injured from driving or engaging in other risky behavior while impaired.
<P>
<LI>Easy access and availability of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs make it difficult to keep young people out of harm's way.
<P>
<LI>Young people who use tobacco are more likely than others to drink heavily later or use illicit drugs.  If we can successfully keep our young people from smoking, we may help prevent other drug use.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "parent27.jpg">
<P>
<LI>Over the past 2 to 3 years, annual use of marijuana doubled among 8th graders, grew by two-thirds among 10th graders, and increased by two-fifths among 12th graders.
<P>
<LI>There was an expansion of the drug use epidemic from the 1960's into the late 1970's, a subsequent turnaround and decline which lasted through 1991, and a resurgence in use since 1991.
<P>
<LI>Fewer young people see harm in using drugs. Yet, understanding the harms associated with drug use is one of the greatest deterrents to drug use by youth.
<P>
<LI>Young people report that getting alcohol, tobacco, and most illicit drugs is very easy.

<P>For many of the reasons already presented in this guide, children are very curious about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.  Kids are smart and they are very quick to pick up mixed messages in the media, at school, or at the dinner table.  Even if we have done an outstanding job of educating and nurturing the children in our care, there are some children who will remain innately curious about alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs  Since many kids are going to find out a lot about drugs from unreliable sources, this section includes some basic information for sharing with children.  The street names of the drugs change weekly and by region, but this list is current!</P>

<P>If you suspect that a child in your care is using drugs, there are several publications available and organizations you can contact for help. Start by contacting the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at 1-800-729-6686. Internet: telnet ncadi.health.org or <A HREF = "http://www.health.org">http://www.health.org</A>.</P>

This data is not being collected statewide at this time.  Data from a selected
number of hospitals is available, but is not sufficient for this report.
Nationally, the number of Emergency Room Drug Abuse Episodes rose from
416,962 in 1988 to 425,904 in 1989, then declined to 371,208 in 1990.  In
1991, the latest year for which national data is available, 400,079
episodes were reported.

<b>9. Incidence of heavy drinking by high school seniors.</b>*
<p>
*[Editor's note:  Statistics presented are "prevalence" rates, not "incidence"
rates.]
<p>
Progress on this indicator seems to have reversed in 1993, and the statewide
rate of "binge drinking" (drinking five or more drinks on a single occasion
within the past two weeks) continues to be much higher than the national
average.  This data is available locally from school districts which 
participated in the "Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use by Indiana Children
and Adolescents" 1994 Survey.

<P>
<B>COCAINE</B> is a powerful, stimulant drug drawn from the leaves
of the South American coca bush. It is an alkaloid, a member of
the chemical family that includes nicotine, caffeine and morphine.
Cocaine is made into a paste and its contents heated with hydrochloric
acid to produce cocaine hydrochloride, the most common, water
soluble form of cocaine, which can be snorted through the nasal
passages, intravenously injected or taken by mouth.
<P>
As it is produced in jungle labs in South America, <B><A NAME="Hydrochloride">COCAINE
HYDROCHLORIDE </b>is approximately 80 percent to 90 percent pure.
The impurities left over from the manufacturing process include
kerosene, benzene, leaded gasoline, powdered lime and a variety
of other substances. Between the jungle lab and the retail user,
cocaine passes through several distribution layers, such as exporters,
importers, drug kingpins and wholesalers who often &quot;cut&quot;
or &quot;step on&quot; the cocaine, diluting it with talcum powder,
amphetamines, local anesthetics and other substances. Today, street
cocaine averages less than 50 percent pure cocaine.</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="freebase">FREEBASE COCAINE </b>is cocaine without
its water-soluble component or &quot;base.&quot; It is prepared
by dissolving cocaine hydrochloride with a strong alkali, and
drawing out the &quot;pure&quot; cocaine from many of the impurities.
Preparing freebase cocaine involves highly explosive solvents
and requires significant preparation time and equipment. Freebasing
originated in the mid-1970s as concern grew about the impurities
in cocaine hydrochloride. Because freebase cocaine is not water
soluble, it must be vaporized and inhaled to be absorbed. This
process is called &quot;smoking,&quot; though it does not involve
actual combustion of the cocaine.</B>
<P>
<B><A NAME="crack">
<img src="/graphics/photographs/drugs/crack.jpg" align=left>
Crack</a></b>is a new type of freebase cocaine
made by heating cocaine hydrochloride with baking soda or ammonia
in water. This process removes the hydrochloride base so the drug
can be &quot;smoked.&quot; Unlike regular freebase preparation,
crack manufacturing does not use explosive solvents. The result
is a hard paste that is cut into chunks resembling rock salt.
These ready-to-use portions allow users to quickly repeat doses
of the drug. Two or three chunks, sufficient for several doses
of the drug, typically sell for $5 to $20.</B>
<P>
The 1990 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that during
1990, 6.2 million persons had tried cocaine. Of that number, 662,000
used cocaine once a week or more and 336,000 used the drug daily
or almost daily. In 1990, 1.6 million North Americans reported
they had used cocaine in the past month; adolescents comprised
115,000 of that total, about 2.6 percent of the total adolescent
population. Of the 1.6 million persons who used cocaine during
the past month, approximately 500,000 had used crack.
<P>
The National High School Senior Survey found that annual use of
cocaine by high-school seniors at least once during their senior
year peaked in 1985 at 13.1 percent. By 1990, it had declined
to 5.3 percent. Use on a monthly basis by high-school seniors
also peaked in 1985 at 6.7 percent, and has declined steadily,
reaching 1.9 percent in 1990.
<P>
Cocaine stimulates the cells of the central nervous system and
the cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous systems. Cocaine is
also a local anesthetic that numbs the mucous membranes of the
mouth, vagina, rectum, and eye. The feeling of stimulation that
comes from cocaine is due to its activation of nerve cells in
the brain that release a chemical (dopamine), which is associated
with pleasure and a sense of alertness. Cocaine &quot;tricks&quot;
the brain into believing it has been furnished with pleasure,
such as food and sex.
<P>
Cocaine is one of the most &quot;reinforcing&quot; of all drugs.
People who use it experience a strong compulsion to continue taking
additional doses. Crack cocaine is especially dangerous because
of its high addiction potential. Because its vapors are inhaled
and go to the brain within seconds, the user experiences an intense
euphoria, while at the same time receiving a very high dose of
the drug. Tolerance to the euphoric effects builds quickly, so
after several doses the user must take more and more of the drug
to feel &quot;high.&quot; Because the euphoric effect lasts only
a few minutes, crack users feel compelled to take repeat doses
every few minutes. Users experience a vicious cycle of high followed
by depression followed by high.
<P>
Damage to body organs may occur as a result of using cocaine hydrochloride
or crack. Inhaling cocaine hydrochloride may cause damage to the
nasal cartilage. Rapid absorption of cocaine can trigger cardiac
irregularities, heart attack and cardiac arrest. Inhalation of
cocaine vapors can, over time, produce bronchitis and other respiratory
complications. Freebasing produces an especially strong immediate
rush, which may lead to convulsions and even death. Body burn-out,
malnutrition, and possible liver damage are also attributed to
crack use. Diseases of contamination, such as Hepatitis B, blood
stream infections and AIDS, may occur due to injection of cocaine
hydrochloride. Women who use cocaine are far more likely to have
miscarriages or spontaneous abortions. Risk of stroke and other
complications in pregnancy due to elevated blood pressure may
result from cocaine use. New research indicates a possible link
between birth defects and cocaine use in women. Studies show babies
born to cocaine addicts are more unresponsive and indifferent
than other newborns.
<P>
The use of cocaine may cause psychological changes in the user.
These effects may be a sense of increased self-esteem and confidence,
depression, intense anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, irritability,
repetition of tasks and a tendency to withdraw form normal activities.
Cocaine psychosis is paranoid behavior that occurs as a result
of overstimulation of the fright centers of the brain. Irrational
violence can occur at even the slightest provocation.<HR>

<P>
<a name="legal">
<B>LEGAL ISSUES:</B> 
<P>
Illegal use or distribution of any form of cocaine is a felony
under both state and federal law. Violators can be charged either
in state court or in federal court. Following is a summary of
Indiana laws on cocaine.
<P>
It is a Class A felony in Indiana to sell more than 3 grams of
cocaine to adults or to sell any amount to a person under 18 years
of age. The usual sentence for a Class A felony is 30 years, which
may range from 10 to 50 years, and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Possession with intent to deliver more than 3 grams, sales of
any amount or possession of 3 grams or more within 1,000 feet
of school property or on a school bus are Class A felonies.
<P>
Delivering up to 3 grams of cocaine to adults is a Class B felony,
as is possessing less than 3 grams of cocaine within 1,000 feet
of school property or on a school bus. The usual sentence for
a Class B felony is 10 years, which may range from 6 to 20 years,
and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Simple possession of 3 grams or more of cocaine is a Class C felony.
The usual sentence for a Class C felony is 5 years, which may
range from 2 to 8 years, and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Simple possession of up to 3 grams of cocaine is a Class D felony.
The usual sentence for a Class D is 2 years, which may range from
1 year to 4 years or be reduced to a Class A misdemeanor, and
carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Note: Although suspension of all or part of prison sentences normally
is allowed under Indiana law, judges are required to impose a
minimum sentence that cannot be suspended on Class A felonies
and delivery of 3 grams or more of cocaine.<HR>

<P><a name = other>
<B>OTHER ISSUES: </B>
<P>
While the health consequences of using cocaine attract much attention,
cocaine use also leads to serious legal, social and economic problems.
<P>
It is estimated that more than half of all crimes against property
(burglary, larceny, etc.) committed in some major cities are related
to the use of crack cocaine and the addict's need for money to
buy the drug.
<P>
Crack addicts often develop a lifestyle based upon participating
in illegal activities to acquire the drug, such as stealing from
friends and family and employers, that results in job and career
problems due to the enormous cost of the habit. Involvement in
gangs and gang violence is often due to the influence of cocaine.
<P>
The U.S. Government Accounting Office has estimated that illegal
cocaine trafficking takes nearly $80 billion per year out of the
economy. Frequent news reports of hundred-million to billion-dollar
cocaine seizures by police attest to the economic impact of cocaine.
<P>
The excessive profit levels can serve as a corrupting influence
on citizens and law enforcement officials as well.
<P>
The huge profit potential tempts poor inner-city youth who can
support a family by selling cocaine, college students who can
make a year's tuition transporting it into the country, as well
as bankers who can make a fortune laundering cocaine profits.
Cocaine is an equal-opportunity corrupter.
<P>
In 1986, The Wall Street Journal reported that the cost of treatment
for cocaine addiction exceeded the cost of heart transplant surgery
in some East Coast hospitals.

<HR>

<H5><B>AMPHETAMINES </B></H5>

<P>
<B>AMPHETAMINES </B>are powerful stimulant drugs that increase
activity in the central nervous system. Their effect is similar
to that of the body's own adrenalin. Even though amphetamines
mimic the effects of adrenalin, they act for a much longer time
in the body.
<P>
Amphetamines can be acquired legally by prescription, although
their medical uses are limited. They are used today to treat childhood
hyperactivity, obesity and narcolepsy, a rare disorder in which
persons are overcome by sudden attacks of deep sleep. Amphetamines
can be taken orally in capsule form, snorted or injected. They
may be referred to as speed, uppers, white crosses, dexies, bennies,
black beauties, crystal and crank.
<P>
Amphetamines first were synthesized in 1887, but were not used
medically until about 1930. Between 1930 and the early 1960s,
amphetamines were prescribed to a variety of people with some
experiencing no ill effects, while others showed relatively mild
forms of amphetamine abuse. Significant abuse of the drug began
to be seen in the United States in the 1960s, when amphetamines
were injected intravenously, and dependence problems became evident.
<P>
The Controlled Substances Act reclassified amphetamines as a Schedule
II Drug. This put tighter controls on manufacturing and prescribing
amphetamines. Many doctors today prescribe &quot;pseudo-amphetamines&quot;
instead of amphetamines. These are Schedule IV drugs, which have
looser controls, but their abuse potential is similar to that
of amphetamines.
<P>
As a result of the tighter controls placed on amphetamines, many
illegal labs now manufacture and sell homemade amphetamines, and
some dealers have taken to selling quasi-legal fake amphetamines.
This illicit market has created additional problems for users,
because it is virtually impossible for a drug user to know if
a capsule is genuine, homemade or a fake.
<P>
<B><A NAME="look">&quot;LOOK-ALIKE DRUGS&quot;</b> </A>are tablets
or capsules that are made to look like real amphetamines and roughly
imitate their effects. They usually contain varying amounts of
legal substances such as caffeine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine,
which are found in over-the-counter diet pills and decongestants.
They are sold on the street as &quot;uppers&quot; or &quot;speed&quot;
and often are purported by the sellers to be authentic amphetamines.
<P>
<B><A NAME="methamphetamine">METHAMPHETAMINE</A></B> is the most
potent form of amphetamine readily available with or without a
prescription. Although pharmaceutical methamphetamine once widely
was available in this country, its medical use is very restricted
today. Almost all of today's methamphetamine is homemade and resembles
a fine coarse powder, crystal or chunks. Its color varies from
off-white to yellow, and it is furnished in plastic wrap, aluminum
foil, capsules or tablets of various sizes and colors. It is taken
into the body by swallowing, snorting or injecting intravenously.
Methamphetamine is called by many names, including crank, crystal,
meth, speed, go-fast, go, crystal meth, zip, chris, cristy, or
ice.
<P>
<B><A NAME="crystal">&quot;CRYSTAL&quot; METHAMPHETAMINE</b> </A>has
experienced a revival on the black market as a replacement for
cocaine or mixed with heroin. It is similar to cocaine in its
euphoric effects, but is longer lasting. Crystal is sold as a
powder that's injected, inhaled or taken orally. It is popular
among some users because Continued from front it is readily available,
of a purer quality, has longer-lasting effects, and is less expensive
than cocaine or heroin on the streets. In the past few years,
police have uncovered several major crystal methamphetamine labs
in Indiana. &quot;CRANK&quot; is another name for methamphetamine.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ice">&quot;ICE&quot; or &quot;GLASS&quot;</b> </A>is a
concentrated form of methamphetamine that resembles tiny chunks
of translucent glass. It is very potent crystal methamphetamine
in a form that can be &quot;smoked&quot; rather than injected.
Because the ice is vaporized and inhaled, and not actually burned,
the term &quot;smoking&quot; is technically incorrect. As crack
is to cocaine, ice is to methamphetamine. The intoxicating high
may last from two to 20 hours, depending on how much is smoked.
Because ice is odorless and has a colorless smoke, users of the
drug may go virtually unnoticed. The use of ice in the United
States began in Hawaii; however, its effects are being seen in
California, and states such as Florida and Texas also have reported
significant problems with the drug.
<P>
The physical effects of amphetamines are similar to those of other
stimulant drugs. When amphetamines are taken by mouth, snorted
or smoked, the user usually experiences feelings of euphoria,
heightened alertness and greater energy. Heart, breathing and
blood pressure rates increase, and sensations of hunger and fatigue
are reduced. Heart palpitations may be experienced. The mouth
is usually dry and swallowing is difficult, which makes eating
food difficult. Urination is also difficult. The users' pupils
are dilated, and reflexes are faster. Rapid speech often occurs,
followed by slurred speech. Extremely high doses may cause people
to flush or become pale, and cause a rapid or irregular heartbeat,
loss of coordination and even physical collapse. Amphetamine injections
create such an increase in blood pressure that strokes, high fevers
or heart failure may result. As the drug wears off, feelings of
fatigue or depression are experienced.
<P>
Amphetamines initially produce physical pleasure, so users easily
are seduced into the repeated use of these drugs. Often users
continually will take amphetamines to avoid the &quot;down&quot;
mood they get when the drug wears off. Tissue tolerance develops
quickly. It is not uncommon for some users to increase from 5
mg. to 1,000 mg. doses over a one-year period. &quot;Speed freaks&quot;
are methamphetamine users who inject their drugs intravenously.
Tissue tolerance develops very rapidly with them, as most methamphetamine
users are compulsive/addictive users who cannot control their
drug taking.
<P>
Long-term heavy use of amphetamines may lead to malnutrition,
skin disorders, ulcers and diseases resulting from vitamin deficiencies.
Regular use may contribute to lack of sleep and weight loss. Intravenous
users are at risk for serious, life-threatening diseases such
as AIDS, lung and heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases.
<P>
Frequent use of large amounts of amphetamines may eventually result
in mental illness, suicide and violent death. Amphetamine-induced
psychosis is a paranoid state that may develop after ingestion
or the injection of large doses of amphetamines.
<P>
Amphetamine use increases self-confidence, which often ignores
the reality of personal limitations. Amphetamine users may experience
&quot;Superman Syndrome,&quot; in which they attempt to perform
tasks they are incapable of performing. In well-rested persons,
certain physical performances can improve with small doses of
stimulant drugs. In tired users, stimulants cause most performance
to deteriorate. Users often take unnecessary risks; truck drivers
and motorists who use amphetamines are more likely to have accidents.
Postponement of sleep due to amphetamine use may result in slower
reaction times and decreased watchfulness.<HR>

<a name="legal">
<P>
<B>LEGAL ISSUES: </B>
<P>
Use or distribution of amphetamines, except when validly prescribed,
is a crime under both Indiana and federal law. Violators could
be charged either in state court or in federal court. Following
is a summary of Indiana laws on amphetamines.
<P>
It is a Class B felony to manufacture, deliver or possess with
the intent to sell amphetamines in Indiana. The usual sentence
for a Class B felony is 10 years, which may range from 6 to 20
years, and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Delivering amphetamines to a person under 18 years of age or to
anyone on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a school
bus is a Class A felony. The usual sentence for a Class A felony
is 30 years, which may range from 10 to 50 years, and carries
a maximum $10,000 fine.
<P>
Delivering look-alike capsules that appear to be or are expressly
or impliedly represented as amphetamines is a Class D felony.
The usual sentence for a Class D felony is 2 years, which may
range from 1 to 4 years, and carries a maximum fine of $10,000.
<P>
Possession of amphetamines without a prescription is a Class D
felony. Possession within 1,000 feet of school property or a school
bus is a Class C felony. The usual sentence for a Class C felony
is 5 years, which may range from 2 to 8 years,and carries amaximum
fine of $10,000.
<P>
Note: Although suspension of all or part of prison sentences normally
is allowed under Indiana law, judges are required to impose a
minimum sentence that cannot be suspended on Class A felonies.

<P>
<h3>INHALANTS</h3> 

Inhalants are gases or vapors that are inhaled to produce
psychoactive (mind-altering) drug effects. The drug category of "Inhalants" is 
characterized by the route or method by which the drugs enter the body, not by their
effects on the body.  There are three distinct categories of inhalants:
nitrous oxide, volatile nitrites, and petroleum distillates. 
  Many people do not think
of these products as harmful or deadly substances because many
are common items used for household and commercial use. Examples
of petroleum distillates include cleaning fluids, airplane glue, nail-polish
remover, hair sprays, paints and cooking sprays.
<P>
The inhaling of chemicals is not a new practice. Getting "high" 
by inhaling substances such as volatile hydrocarbons and anesthetics
was common in the 1800s in Europe, Great Britain and North America.
The use of ether and nitrous oxide also was not uncommon. In the
early 1900s, alcohol, ether and chloroform were inhalants of choice.
In the 1940s and 1950s, sniffing gasoline was prevalent. The 1960s
brought about additional abuses, which are still popular today,
including the sniffing of glues and acetone.<p><HR>

<P><a name="warning">
<h3>WARNING SIGNS OF USE: </h3>

Users of inhalants may exhibit the following characteristics:
<P>
Neglect of personal appearance; 
<P>
Lack of interest in school or work;
<P>
Withdrawal from family and/or friends; 
<P>
Retreat from athletic activities; 
<P>
Nonsensical talk; 
<P>
Loss of drive; 
<P>
Chemical odor on clothes or breath; 
<P>
Possesses paraphernalia (bags, discarded aerosol cans or rags).
<p>
<HR>


<P><a name = "common">
<h3>COMMON INHALANTS: </h3>

<B>NITROUS OXIDE </B>is a light anesthetic gas used as a painkiller in 
medicine and dentistry.  The drug also is used as a propellant
for whipping cream, and is used as a boosting agent to accelerate
combustion in auto racing.  Inhaling it creates
an intense, brief "high" that lasts for only a few minutes at
a time. 
<p>
Nitrous Oxide was discovered in the 1770s by Joseph Priestly.  It
has been used as an anesthetic since the mid-1800s.  It does not
completely block pain, but relieves a patient's anxiety and creates 
a dreamy or floating sensation.  Since it is not a complete pain 
killer, it is used in combination with other drugs in medicine and
dentistry.  In medicine, it is often mixed with halogenated gases, 
and with local anesthetics in dentistry.
<p>

<B>THE VOLATILE NITRITES</B> are stimulant drugs that produce powerful
heart stimulant effects.  <B>AMYL NITRITE</B> is a prescription drug for individuals
suffering from heart problems or asthma.  It is ususally dispensed 
in single dose glass ampoules, which are small glass vials covered with gauze.   
When used, the glass ampoule is crushed between the fingers and
and the vapors of the clear yellow liquid are inhaled.  The causes the blood vessels to 
dilate and the heart to beat faster.  Simultaneously, the amyl 
nitrite reduces the oxygen supply to the inner part of the brain 
and creates a sudden and intense weakness and dizziness. These effects can last 30 to
60 seconds.  
<B>BUTYL NITRITE </B>products are amyl nitrite substitues marketed 
as so-called room deodorizers in an attempt to avoid regulation as drugs.
They are packaged and available in small bottles and sold under names
such as &quot;LOCKER ROOM&quot; or &quot;RUSH.&quot; Butyl, unlike
amyl, is not legally classified as a prescription drug.  Consequently, these
chemicals often are available in bars and boutiques. Common effects
of this drug are identical to those of amyl nitrite and include a 
euphoric state that lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes. 
Individuals experience low blood pressure, followed by an increase in blood pressure, flushed face, dizziness and
headache. The &quot;rush&quot; occurs quickly and dissipates 
quickly so experienced users are inclined to maintain a &quot;high&quot;
by using increasing amounts of the inhalant. 
<p>
<B>PETROLEUM DISTILLATES</B> are gases or vapors of liquids that 
are made from petroleum.  They are used non-medically as powerful 
depressant intoxicant drugs.  The vapors of any common petroleum products 
are inhaled for their mind-altering effects, including <b>gasoline,
lighter fluid, kerosene, toulene, naptha, and model airplane glue.</b>  
Other petroleum distillate inhalants include aerosol gases used as a 
propellant in cooking sprays, spray paints, and cleaning supplies.  
Petroleum distillates are also found in such common household products 
as typewriter correction fluid and certain permanent magic markers.

<P><a name = "effects">
<B>ADVERSE EFFECTS: </B>
<P>
Some Inhalants are both physically and psychologically addictive, and
their effects depend on the type of inhalant used. In general, individuals
who use inhalants may risk these effects:
<P>
Depression and apathy
<P>
Nosebleeds
<P>
Headaches and eye pain
<P>
Kidney or liver damage
<P>
Chronic tired feeling
<P>
Heart failure
<P>
Slurred speech Anemia
<P>
Sores on mouth/nose
<p>
 Poor balance/coordination
<P>
Irritability
<P>
Personality changes 
<p>
Loss of muscle control
<P>
Bad breath and chemical odor
<P>
Severe nervous system and brain damage
<P>

<table border=3>
<tr><th colspan=2>Nitrous Oxide</th></tr>
<tr><td>General Effect:</td><td>Nitrous oxide produces a very intense euphoria.
The user appears to be delighted with life and unconcerned with things around him/her.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eyes:</td><td>Usually wide open and a bit dilated.  The
intense euphoria may be "visible" in the eyes of the user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vital Signs:</td><td>Rapid pulse and somewhat elevated blood pressure.  
Deep inhalations may be related to method of administration. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Skin:</td><td>No Change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Onservation:</td><td>It is obvious that the user is intoxicated
and use may be accompanied by laughter and boisterousness (thus the
name "laughing gas.")</td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=2>   </td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=2>Volatile Nitrites</th></tr>
<tr><td>General Effect</td><td>The volatile nitrites are stimulants that produce an intense
"rush."</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eyes:</td><td>No change.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vital Signs:</td><td>Increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure, along 
with rapid and deep respirations.  Pulse may be bounding. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Skin:</td><td>Often flushed, often moist from persiration.</td><tr>
<tr><td>Observation:</td><td>Relaxation of smooth muscles.</td></tr>

<tr> <td colspan=2>   <td></tr>
<tr> <th colspan=2>Petroleum Distillates</th><tr>
<tr><td>General Effect:</td><td>Petroleum distillates are depressants that produce an 
intoxication similar to large doses of alcohol.  These drugs are 
sometimes called "deleriants," due to the creation of a delerious effect in the user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eyes:</td><td>Often glassy, the pupils may be constricted and 
may be slow to respond to light. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Vital Signs:</td><td>Slower pulse and respirations and lower blood pressure.  
Breathing may be shallow and somewhat labored. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Skin:</td><td>No change unless shock sets in, in which case it may be cool and clammy. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Observation:</td><td>The user appears to be "drunk" and may stumble 
when trying to walk.  A loss of coordination and ability to perform skilled tasks is common.  
The user may smell of the inhalant chemical and may continue to 
inhale it from a plastic bag or from a rag soaked in the liquid. </td></tr>

<P><a name = "alert">
<h3>PARENT/TEACHER ALERT: </h3>

Hazardous fumes and vapors are inhaled in a number of ways, often
as part of a group activity. Parents and teachers should be alert
for rags, cotton balls or tissues that are saturated with chemicals.
Users sometimes pour inhalants into soft-drink cans, which then
are held up to the face, or inhale from plastic bags.
<P>
Sniffing permanent-base magic markers or typewriter correction
fluid and spray paint also is common. Be alert for paint (especially
gold and silver), ink or correction fluid near the nostrils.
<P>
Inhaling from plastic bags is especially dangerous due to the
additional risk of asphyxiation.<p><HR>

<P><a name = legal>
<h3>LEGAL ISSUES: </h3>
<P>
Glue sniffing is a class B misdemeanor under Indiana law. A person
is guilty of glue sniffing if he or she inhales or ingests &quot;model
glue, or any substance containing toluene, acetone, benzene, N-butyl
nitrite, or any alphatic nitrite&quot; (not prescribed by a doctor)
to become intoxicated. The penalty for a class B misdemeanor in
Indiana is maximum imprisonment of 180 days and a maximum fine
of $1,000.
<P>
It is also a class B misdemeanor to distribute nitrous oxide for 
the purpose of producing intoxication.
<p>
Amyl nitrite and certain forms of nitrous oxide are &quot;legend&quot; drug under Indiana law. That
means only licensed practitioners (such as physicians, dentists
or pharmacists) may dispense them. Therefore, sale of a legend drug
 is illegal unless
it is dispensed by a pharmacist upon a prescription or drug order.
<P>
It is the crime of "maintaining a common nuisance" under Indiana law for any
person knowingly to maintain or visit a place (such as a store,
shop, warehouse, home or vehicle) used by that person or any other
person for unlawful use or sale of any legend drug.
<p>
<HR>
<h3>PATTERN OF USE </h3>
Unlike use of other drugs which continue to increase through 12th grade, 
inhalant use peaks in 8th or 9th grade.  In 1996, 8.0% of Indiana 8th graders 
reported using inhalants on a monthly or more frequent basis.  This compares
with 6.1% of 8th graders in a 1995 national survey.  In 1996, 18.3% of Indiana
9th graders reported using inhalants at least once in their lifetimes.
<p>
Anecdotal reports suggest that use of the petroleum distillate inhalants 
peaks at 8th grade and then declines each grade, but use of nitrous oxide 
and the volatile nitrites may continue to increase with each grade level.  Since 
most inhalant use involves the petroleum distillates, total inhalant use 
declines in the later grades.

Are under-age students following &quot;imaginary&quot; peers?<!--Are under-age students following &quot;imaginary&quot; peers?-->

<P>
<I><B>A</B>ccording to Surgeon General Antonia Novello, more of
today's college students will die from alcohol-related illnesses
and injuries than will receive masters' degrees.</I> 
<P>
<I>More than 32 percent of this year's high-school seniors got
drunk at least once in the past two weeks, despite the fact that
nearly all of them are under the legal drinking age.</I> 
<P>
<I>More than one-third of Hoosier eighth-graders drink alcohol
at least once a month; more than half our 10th- and 11th-graders
do too.</I> 
<P>
<I>More than one-fourth of American high-school seniors report
that &quot;most or all&quot; of their friends get drunk at least
once a week.</I> 
<P>
<I>Alcohol related incidents kill more American teen-agers than
all other factors combined.</I> 
<P>
<I>Where do all these under-age youth get the idea it's all right
for them to drink? Whatever happened to the minimum drinking age?
What factors contribute to our current epidemic of under-age drinking?
Social acceptance? Lax law enforcement? Peer pressure? Who established
the social norms that seem to accept under-age drinking? Are the
norms set by community consensus, or are they the result of some
big misunderstanding?</I> 
<P>
<I>In this issue, Prevention Newsline focuses on under-age drinking.
In addition to the article that follows, articles on pages 3,
4 and 5 also consider use of alcohol by minors.</I> 
<P>
<B>Students overestimate drinking patterns of their peers</B>

<P>
<B>R</B>ecent research on college-student drinking norms sheds
some light on under-age drinking in general.
<P>
Although this article discusses how college-student drinking norms
are established, the findings are relevant to high-school and
junior high-school students as well. Numerous studies have shown
that students of all ages -- grade school through college -- greatly
overestimate peer use of alcohol and other drugs.
<P>
For many students, entering college is the first time to really
taste independence from parents and from many restrictions. The
pressure to adjust and conform is great. Making new friends and
following the crowd may be seen as essential to the transition
from high school to college, especially for freshmen.
<P>
College students have very definite perceptions regarding the
&quot;normal&quot; alcohol-related behaviors and attitudes of
other students, and these perceptions often influence their own
patterns of alcohol use. Yet studies conducted on a number of
college campuses reveal that students habitually <B>overestimate</B>
the extent to which their peers hold permissive attitudes or engage
in behaviors associated with abuse.
<P>
These misperceptions about peer behaviors in turn affect an individual's
own use of alcohol and other drugs. The result may be that one
&quot;imaginary peer&quot; is following OR leading another &quot;imaginary
peer&quot; down a path where neither truly desires to travel.
<P>
Research about norm misperceptions of students' alcohol and other
drug use by Alan Berkowitz, PhD. of Hobart and William Smith Colleges
in Geneva, NY, found the drinking behavior of most students was
more affected by peer influences than by family, personality,
ethnicity, or personal background characteristics.
<P>
&quot;This may be so because students spend a majority of their
time with other students and are strongly influenced in behaviors
by each other, sharing many similar values and beliefs,&quot;
Berkowitz wrote in a paper titled <I>Following Imaginary Peers:
How Norm Misperceptions Influence Student Substance Abuse.</I>

<P>
&quot;When these beliefs pertain to general standards of behavior
held by members of a group, they may be called norms. Norms exist
for how much students should drink, when and where they drink,
and how they behave when drinking. Norms are actual standards
of conduct and behaviors which are shared in common by members
of a group or culture. The college environment itself has been
referred to as a subculture with a unique set of norms for behavior
in general, and for drinking and other drug use in particular.&quot;
<P>
The extent of norm misperceptions may vary according to the type
of relationship involved, such as whether the relationship involves
a good friend, other residents of the same living unit, or fellow
students on campus. For example, while most students will overestimate
the alcohol and other drug attitudes of their friends and members
of their living unit, they do so even more when judging the overall
campus climate. In fact, the less familiar students are with individuals
or groups, the more likely it is they will be perceived inaccurately.
Students slightly misperceive their friends, have an exaggerated
sense of those in the living unit, and misperceive the overall
campus attitiude the most.
<P>
To illustrate, just imagine a student has a friend from home visiting
for the weekend. The two attend a large campus party, at which
a few individuals become obnoxiously drunk. Even though a majority
of the party guests do not display offensive behaviors, chances
are the campus visitor will perceive the whole college's population
to have the same attitudes as the rowdy few.
<P>
Berkowitz believes prevention education programs should try to
correct the misperceptions students hold about their peers' alcohol
and other drug use, possibly resulting in a reduction of alcohol
abuse or other associated behaviors. Therefore, students who are
more moderate may become comfortable declining a beer and socializing
with a cola in hand. They may feel more willing to let others
know when drinking behavior becomes inappropriate. The entire
campus community may become less tolerant of abusive use of alcohol
and other drugs.
<P>
Because peer influence is a significant factor in the drinking
behavior of students, changing the misperceptions students have
about other students' attitudes and behaviors associated with
alcohol and other drugs may be effective as a prevention strategy.
When they operate under misperceptions, many students ignore their
own better judgment because they fear disapproval or rejection
by their peers. By providing information and education to correct
the norm misperception of students' alcohol and drug use, we may
help free the students who already hold more responsible attitudes
to confront those who use alcohol and drugs destructively and
in ways that are unfair to others.
<P>
Berkowitz warns, however, that &quot;acknowledging the personal
expectancies regarding the use of alcohol does not negate the
fact that it has certain physiological effects.&quot; Alcohol
has well-documented effects on the central nervous system, it
impairs judgment, and it interferes with complex motor skills.
But it is important to also acknowledge how much of one's behaviors
and expectations associated with alcohol are socially conditioned
and can be changed if we examine our assumptions and correct them.
<P>
&quot;By making it less acceptable to use alcohol as an excuse
for our behavior and by learning more constructive ways to have
fun or relax, we can help reduce the problem use and abuse of
alcohol and other drugs among college students.&quot;

<P>
<B>National minimum drinking age a myth</B> 
<P>
Sometimes good ideas are based upon faulty information. Many of
the principles that guide the development of alcohol and other
drug messages for youth are based upon the assumption that we
have a national minimum drinking age of 21, and that people under
that age cannot drink legally. We are told not to talk about &quot;responsible
use&quot; to minors, because minors are never allowed to drink.
<P>
As a Hoosier, that idea seemed logical to me. In Indiana there
is an absolute ban on minor consumption of alcoholic beverages.
Minors are not allowed to consume alcoholic beverages in Indiana
under any circumstances - never - there are no loopholes! I assumed
that, with the strong federal incentives tied to eligibility for
highway grants, all states had similar bans. I was wrong.
<P>
A recent court case in Monroe County raised my awareness of other
states' loopholes. An 18-year-old high-school senior was found
&quot;not guilty&quot; of minor consumption because the prosecutor
could not prove that the minor had not consumed the alcohol, legally,
in Ohio! It seems that one of his parents lived in Ohio, and Ohio
has a loophole in its minimum drinking-age law. Minors of any
age can legally consume alcohol in Ohio if the alcohol is furnished
by a parent in a private home.
<P>
That's a big loophole. Ten-year-olds could legally get drunk in
a private home! I thought that Ohio must be an anomaly. Surely
there weren't such loopholes in other state laws. I was wrong
again.
<P>
My non-lawyer's review of the laws of all 50 states and the District
of Columbia found loopholes in the laws of at least half the states.
A good lawyer might be able to find even more loopholes. Some
of the loopholes are big enough to drive a beer wagon through!
<P>
The most common loophole is &quot;parental permission.&quot; In
about half the states, it is legal for minors to drink alcohol,
in a private home, with the permission of their parent or legal
guardian. In some states, they may even drink in bars or restaurants
when in the presence of their parents.
<P>
Another common loophole is a &quot;public consumption ban.&quot;
In some states the law against minor consumption only applies
in public places. A minor can legally consume alcohol in private
in some states, sometimes even without parental permission. In
a few cases, college residence-hall rooms are considered private
places.
<P>
In Indiana, it is illegal for a minor to (1) consume, (2) possess,
or (3) transport an alcoholic beverage. In some states, the ban
is against possession only. This requires police to catch minors
with alcohol in their hands. Once the alcohol is in their system,
they are immune from arrest. That seems to promote rapid drinking.
<P>
A few states set the penalties for minor consumption so low that
law-enforcement officers may lose interest in enforcing the law.
In Iowa, 19- and 20-year-olds can be fined a maximum $15 for minor
possession. That's hardly much of a deterrent!
<P>
In Louisiana, private clubs are exempt places, and some courts
have interpreted that so broadly that college fraternities have
been immune from prosecution for serving high-school students.
<P>
Some states remain silent about certain situations. Sales to minors
or possession by minors may be banned, but consumption is not
specifically mentioned. Consumption in public may be banned, but
the law may be silent on private consumption.
<P>
In at least half our states, there are at least some circumstances
under which minors are allowed (or at least not forbidden) to
consume alcohol. Given our very mobile populations, even residents
of states with absolute bans, such as Indiana, cannot assume that
our high-school students may not encounter situations (on vacation,
for example), where they could legally consume alcoholic beverages.
<P>
We may need to rethink how we handle this issue in light of other
states' failure to enact and enforce meaningful minimum drinking-age
laws.

Make your community a drug-free zone<!--Make your community a drug-free zone-->

<P>
&quot;Drug Free Zones .... Taking Action&quot; is an exciting
new video available for loan from the Indiana Prevention Resource
Center. &quot;Drug Free Zones&quot; examines how a community can
become motivated and involved in the fight against alcohol and
other drug problems in schools, communities and housing developments.
<P>
This 27-minute video is hosted by Edward James Olmos and features
residents from New York to California -- real people who have
taken action against those promoting the use of alcohol and other
drugs to the youth and citizens of their communities.
<P>
The message of the video is that communities can take action,
and that there is hope of reclaiming a community that is being
overtaken by the use of alcohol and other drugs.
<P>
Viewers of the video are given practical ideas about things they
can do as individuals or groups to reduce the drug and alcohol
use by youth in their communities. These include filing claims
in small claims court, asking city officials to add street lights
and working with local law-enforcements officials to start a community
policing program. One example of a community's small, but important
step in reducing drug trafficking was a change in the time sprinklers
were turned on in the city park. Residents found that drugs were
being sold and used in the park at specific times of day. To curtail
this, the citizens' action group went to the city parks department
and asked that the lawn sprinklers be turned on during those times.
This simple action ended the use of the park for the selling and
using of drugs in that area.
<P>
A community action guide comes with the video. It gives suggestions
about on how to get started on the activities in the video. Ideas
about how to organize and lead the group and how to develop a
plan of action are provided. Several copies of &quot;Drug Free
Zones ... Taking Action&quot; are available for loan from the
PRC.

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism<br>
No. 15         PH 311         January 1992      <hr>
</center><h6>Alcohol Alert, a publication of the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, provides timely information on alcohol
research and treatment to health professionals and other
interested people.  This issue is the fifteenth in the
series.</h6> <h2>Alcohol and AIDS</h2>
<p>         
There are two reasons to investigate connections between alcohol, HIV 
infection, and AIDS: alcohol may adversely affect the immune system, 
and alcohol may influence high-risk sexual behavior.
<p>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the agent that causes acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome(AlDS).  HlV is transmitted through sexual contact 
with an infected individual, through exchange of infected blood or blood 
products, or to the newborn from an infected mother.  HIV-infected persons 
may harbor the virus for many years with no clinical signs of disease.  
Eventually, HIV destroys the body's immune system, mainly by impairing a 
class of white blood cells whose regulatory activities are essential for 
immune protection.  As a result, people who have AIDS are prone to lung 
infections, brain abscesses, and a variety of other infections caused by 
microorganisms that usually do not produce disease in healthy people.  
Those who have AIDS also are prone to cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, 
a skin cancer rarely seen in non-HlV-infected populations.  The diagnosis of 
AIDS depends in part on the presence of one or a number of these infections 
and cancers (1).*
<p>
One million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with 
HIV (2).  At least 40,000 new HIV infections are thought to occur among 
adults and adolescents, and an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 new HIV infections 
are thought to occur among newborns each year.  Currently, 8 to 10 million 
people worldwide are estimated to be infected with HIV (3).  Of these,
50 percent are expected to develop AIDS within 10 years, and 90 percent may 
develop AIDS within 20 years of initial infection (4).  The prognosis for 
persons with AIDS is grim: AIDS-associated mortality may approach 85 percent 
within 5 years of diagnosis (5).
<p>         
<h3>Alcohol and the Immune System</h3>
Alcohol can impair normal immune responses that protect the body from 
disease (6,7,8).  Chronic alcohol consumption has been shown to reduce 
the number of infection-fighting white blood cells in laboratory animals
(9,10,11) and in humans (12,13).  Chronic alcohol ingestion or alcohol 
dependence can depress antibody production and other immune responses in 
animals (10,9) and in humans (14,15).  Alcohol can suppress activities of 
certain immune system cells, called macrophages, that help keep the lungs 
free from infection (16,17).  In addition, alcoholics appear to be more 
susceptible to bacterial infections and cancer than are nonalcoholics (18,19).  
Studies in animals and in humans indicate that consuming alcohol during 
pregnancy can decrease immune resistance in the offspring (20,21,22).
<p> 
Alcohol's generally immunosuppressive effects couid mean that 1) drinking 
may increase vulnerability to HIV infection among people exposed to the 
virus, and that 2) among people who are already HIV infected, 
alcohol-induced immunosuppression might add to HlV-induced immunosuppression, 
and speed the onset or exacerbate the pathology of AlDS-related illness.  
These are complex ideas and areas of intense investigation, but so far only a 
few studies have been published.  Researchers have learned that alcohol can 
impair white blood cell responses to HIV (23).  A provocative study that 
warrants replication found that a single drinking episode depressed certain 
immune responses of white blood cells taken from healthy volunteers (24).
<p>   
In addition, white blood cells isolated after this drinking episode were more 
susceptible to HIV infection than were cells isolated from subjects who did 
not drink, hinting that even occasional alcohol consumption may increase the 
likelihood of infection upon exposure to HIV.  Whether alcohol use influences 
the progression of AIDS in persons already infected with HIV has been 
explored in a recent study of homosexual men (25).  While these researchers 
found that neither alcohol nor other drugs seem to influence the progression 
of HIV infection or the development of AIDS, their results await 
confirmation.  Clearly, more research is needed to understand alcohol's role 
in HIV infection and the course of ensuing disease.

<h3>Alcohol and Sexual Behavior</h3>

Sexual practices considered to be high risk for acquiring HlV from an 
infected individual include vaginal or anal intercourse without a condom: 
other sexual practices that facilitate exchange of blood, semen, or other 
body secretions; and unprotected sexual activities with multiple partners.  
The frequency with which sexual partners engage in such practices also 
influences the risk for exposure to HIV.
<p>
Alcohol's relationship to high-risk sexual behavior may be explained in two 
ways.  First, alcohol use may be a marker for a risk-taking temperament: 
those who drink alcohol may also engage in a variety of high-risk activities, 
including unsafe sexual practices, as a part of a "problem behavior syndrome" 
(26,27).  Second, alcohol may influence high-risk behaviors at specific 
sexual encounters by affecting judgment and disinhibting socially learned 
restraints (28,29).   These are not mutually exciusive interpretations.
<p>
In addition, these two explanations have different implications for the 
prevention of high-risk sexual behavior.  Among people who have a risk-taking 
temperament, reducing alcohol consumption may not reduce high-risk sexual 
behavior.   However, among those who are more likely to take sexual risks 
when they are drinking, than when they are not, reducing alcohol consumption
should also reduce high risk sexual behavior.
<p>
There are two approaches to studying alcohol's relationship to sexual
behavior that may result in HIV infection (30).   One approach examines 
whether alcohol use in general is correiated with sexua risk-taking 
behavior in general.  In this approach, an observed association between
drinking and high-risk sexual activity could imply that these two behaviors 
are part of a large risk-taking tendency, or that alcohol itself influences 
sexual risk-taking, or both.  Another approach examines the consequences of 
alcohol use during specific sexual encounters.  An observed connection 
between alcohol use and sexual risk-taking during specific encounters 
suggests a direct influence of alcohol on such behavior.
<p>
A number of studies have identified associations between drinking and 
high-risk sexual activity.  These studies also have found that an absence 
of or a reduction in alcohol use is associated with a decrease in high-risk 
sexual behavior.  A study of heterosexual drinking habits and sexual behavior 
found that women and men who frequently combined alcohol use with sexual 
encounters were generally less likely to use condoms during intercourse (31).  
Similarly a study of homosexual men found alcohol or other drug use combined 
with sexual activity to be strongly associated with high-risk sexual behavior: 
even those who drank only occasionaily at the time of sexual encounters 
were twice as likely to be categorized as "high-risk," based on the frequency 
of involvement in a range of sexual practices within nonmonogamous 
relationships, than were those who did not drink (32).   Further, those men
who did not drink during sexual encounters were three times more likely to 
be classified in a "no risk" category than were men who combined drinking 
with sexual activity.  Recently, a reduction in alcohol use among homosexual 
men has been associated with a reduction in high-risk sexual behavlor (33).
<p>
Other studies that examine the consequences of alcohol use at specific sexual 
encounters also have demonstrated a connection between alcohol use and 
high-risk sexual behavior.  Scottish adolescents who drank at the time of 
first intercourse were less likely to have used a condom than those who did 
not drink (34).   A survey of adolescents in Massachusetts revealed that teens 
were less likely to use condoms if sexual activity foliowed drinking or other 
drug use (35).  Similarly, adult homosexual men and heterosexual women (but 
not heterosexual men) reported tnat they were less likely to use a condom 
during those sexual encounters in which they felt intoxicated (36).  
These reports of simultaneous alcohol use and high-risk sexual behavior 
suggest that alcohol can directly influence sexual risk-taking.  However, 
these combined behaviors may still reflect a risk-taking tendency in some 
individuals.
<p>
Further research is needed to define conditions under which alcohol use is 
linked to high-risk sexual activity.  Information generated from such studies 
will be vital for developing and improving programs to prevent HIV 
transmission.

<h3>Alcohol and AIDS- A Commentary </h3
by NIAAA Director Enoch Gordis, M.D.
<p>
Science has made remarkable progress in our understanding of HIV and AIDS.  
Yet we know very little about the role of alcohol in the transmission and 
acquisition of HIV or in the progression ot HIV infection to AIDS.  Such 
knowledge would enhance efforts to prevent HIV exposure and decrease the 
number of new AIDS cases.
<p>
We know that alcohol affects the immune system.  This suggests that alcohol 
could affect the course of HIV infection and AIDS, which is a disease of the 
immune system.  For example, alcohol might affect the body's ability to 
defend against HIV infection upon exposure to the virus: alcohol might alter 
the course of infection to the development of AIDS; or alcohol might affect 
the severity or duration of the special infections, known as opportunistic 
infections, that characterize AIDS.  So far, the research findings in this 
area are hard to reconcile.  On one hand, laboratory evidence shows clearly 
that alcohol impairs the ability of white blood cells to defend against the 
human immunodeficiency virus. On the other hand, studies involving human
populatlons have found that neither alcohol nor other drugs modify the course 
of HIV infection or AIDS.  Given the complexity of the human immune system,
the contradictions presented by these findings, while puzzling, are not 
unexpected.  One key to solving this puzzle will be more attention, in 
long-term studies of human populations, to objective evidence of drinking 
and to laboratory evidence of immune function status.
<p>
We know also that alcohol is associated with high-risk sexual activity that 
potentially can result in exposure to HIV.  Some people may be more likely 
to engage in certain sexual behaviors when drinking as a result of alcohol's 
disinhibiting effects.  (In others, alcohol use and unsafe sexual 
practices seem to be a part of a "risk-taking temperament," in which unsafe
sexual practices may occur whether or not alcohol is consumed.)
<p>
Prevention efforts that address the link between alcohol consumption and 
unsafe sex are being evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing high-risk 
sexual activity.  In addition, researchers are investigating various 
settings, such as bars and alcohol treatment programs, and certain groups,
such as teenagers, where intervention strategies could be employed to
decrease alcohol-related high-risk sexual activity.  It is hoped that these 
findings will help target HlV-related prevention strategies in a way that 
will help to reduce the incidence of new cases of HIV infection, and 
ultimately reduce the number of persons with AIDS.

<H3><I><B>Learning from those who said &quot;No&quot;</B></I>
 </H3>

<H3>Resilience may be key to prevention </H3>

<P>
Should prevention programs be based upon positives or negatives?
Can we learn more from people who said &quot;Yes,&quot; or from
people who said &quot;No&quot;?
<P>
There is growing consensus in the drug-prevention field that effective
prevention programs need to be based upon knowledge gained from
the study of those who successfully avoided alcohol and other
drug problems -- not those who used and abused.
<P>
During the 1980s, much of the attention of drug professionals
focused on &quot;what went wrong&quot; in youth and adults who
developed alcohol and other drug problems. Little attention was
focused on &quot;what went right&quot; in those who managed to
avoid problems.
<P>
Recently, attention has shifted to studying why some so-called
&quot;high-risk youth&quot; are successful in staying free of
alcohol and other drugs. These &quot;resilient&quot; youth may
have had ample opportunity and predisposition to use chemical
substances, but were able to overcome their risk factors through
reliance upon protective factors that helped them avoid problems.
<P>
For example, while children of alcoholics are at greater risk
than others of developing alcohol and coping problems, the vast
majority of children of alcoholics do not develop alcoholism or
serious coping problems. Some researchers estimate that only one
in five develop such problems. Prevention programs based upon
the resilient children of alcoholics should be more effective
than those based upon the &quot;casualties.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The concept of risk factors ... is only one component necessary
to understanding the range of youth drug-related behaviors,&quot;
noted Kevin McIntyre, Douglas White and Richard Yoast in their
monograph, <I>Resilience among High Risk Youth</I>, published
recently by the Wisconsin Clearinghouse. &quot;A second component,
'protective factors,' or those aspects of a person's biology,
psychology, and environment which serve to mediate or mitigate
against substance abuse, are at least as important.&quot;
<P>
In an extensive review of the literature, Hawkins, Lishner, Catalano,
and Howard (1985) identified several potential protective factors
that seemed to reduce the likelihood of adolescent involvement
with alcohol and other drugs. They noted that adolescents with
positive relationships, involvement and bonding within families,
strong role models, educational successes, good school bonding,
and focused aspirations seemed much less likely to develop alcohol
and drug problems. Easy temperaments seemed to enable children
and adolescents to adapt to stresses and adopt more positive attitudes,
and both of these attributes seem to be powerful protective factors.
<P>
In 1986, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
commissioned another literature review, which was prepared by
Macro Systems, Inc. This review noted three additional categories
of potential protective factors against alcohol abuse: parental,
peer and environmental. Parental factors included &quot;parental
disapproval of alcohol use by youth, setting clear expectations
for nonuse, and ... strong family relationships and social competencies.&quot;
Peer factors included accurate perceptions of norms of use and
nonuse by peers, and skills to resist pressures to use. Environmental
factors included such things as availability and accessibility
of alcohol in the community, and the ability to critically examine
alcohol advertising.
<P>
Among the &quot;protective factors&quot; Hawkins and his associates
described was a strong commitment to education. Adolescents committed
to education, even if they were otherwise high risk, were much
less likely to use drugs than their peers. This suggests that
programs to increase student interest in education, such as Indiana's
new 21st Century Scholars Program, can foster resilience in participating
students. (See article on page 4.)
<P>
Those who have developed social competence and possess the skills
to resist unwanted peer pressure also exhibit resilience. A model
program is Project SMART (Self Management And Resistance Training),
developed at the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
Research at the University of Southern California. Beginning in
the early 1980s, the USC project team developed strategies and
techniques to enhance resistance to peer pressure via classroom-based
activities. The same team helped build Kansas City's Project STAR
(Students Taught Awareness and Resistance) and Indiana's Project
I-STAR (Indiana Students Taught Awareness and Resistance). These
projects recently were commended by the U.S. secretary of health
and human services as models of proven effectiveness.
<P>
Another model to enhance resilience is the Life Skills Training
curriculum developed by Botvin and his associates. LST combines
factual information about alcohol and other drugs with information
about social pressures to use, and techniques for resisting the
pressure. Participants learn and practice skills to think critically,
make informed decisions, and control anxieties and pressures.
The program also develops communication skills, assertiveness
and skills in handling male/female relationships. A rigorous evaluation
has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing alcohol, tobacco
and other drug use among students who complete LST.
<P>
The latest twist on resilience applies the idea of developing
skills and competence -- &quot;empowerment&quot; -- to communities.
Just as individuals can reduce the risk of developing alcohol
and other drug problems by avoiding risk factors and enhancing
protective factors, communities can reduce collective risks by
avoiding factors that expose the community to risk and enhancing
factors that protect the community from problems.
<P>
Communities can develop collective skills and community networks
to enhance their abilities to resist social pressures that promote
alcohol and other drug abuse. Hansen and his associates, who developed
Project SMART to enhance individual resilience, are developing
a &quot;social ecology model&quot; to enhance community resilience.
The model describes how community environments increase or decrease
exposure to drug problems for residents and considers the impact
on community acceptance or rejection of drug use of such factors
as alcoholic beverage licensing, law-enforcement priorities, prosecution
and adjudication strategies, parent networks to supervise adolescent
social activities, media support and community values.
<P>
Schools and communities can enhance resilience by adopting and
implementing policies and norms that promote nonuse of alcohol
and other drugs. Communities can influence public policy on advertising
and promotion of alcohol and tobacco, reporting of drug-law violations,
enforcement of regulations on sale and serving of alcohol and
tobacco to minors, and taxation and pricing policies.
<P>
Prevention strategies that build resilience often are perceived
as &quot;positive&quot; and therefore more attractive to community
support. The next issue of <I>Prevention Newsline</I> will highlight
successful programs that build resilience and discuss ideas for
gaining community support.

<H3>Alcohol, tobacco campaigns frequently aim at women, children,
minorities </H3>

<H4>Marketers target 'vulnerable' consumers</H4>

<P>
<I><B>Since his 1988 debut, Old Joe Camel has become a ubiquitous
presence on billboards, phone booths and magazine pages. Whether
he's on the beach or in the bar, straddling his chopper or jamming
on the bandstand, the macho dromedary is often surrounded by adoring
babes. Sometimes Joe offers Camel buyers coupons that can be redeemed
for T-shirts and baseball caps. He also mugs for promotional events
such as the Camel &quot;Mud &amp; Monster&quot; series, a stadium
show in which trucks with giant wheels drive over piles of empty
cars.</B></I>

<P>

marketing. In its attempts to revive its Michelob brand, Anheuser-Busch
is targeting women.</B></I> 
<P>
<I>--USA Today</I>, Feb. 3, 1992
<P>
<B>M</B>arketers spend innumerable hours and dollars finding new
ways to sell their products. This includes researching audiences,
their perceived needs, perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. The
resulting marketing campaigns create an atmosphere of acceptability
and necessity for products.
<P>
Part of marketing is targeting a particular population based on
audience characteristics such as gender, age or ethnicity, and
advertisers strategically place their campaigns where they want
the target population to see them. As traditional market segments
shrink and new groups command more buying power, marketers turn
their attention to those markets. Hence, we see alcohol advertisements
appearing in &quot;youth-oriented&quot; publications, and tobacco
ads saturating billboards in ethnic communities.
<P>
Concern is increasing over the targeting of &quot;vulnerable&quot;
consumers. A great deal of recent concern has focused on RJ Reynolds'
Joe Camel cigarette campaign, after studies published in December
in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> indicated
the cartoon-like camel strongly attracts children and adolescents
to smoking.
<P>
For various reasons, four specific populations have emerged as
target audiences for alcohol and tobacco marketers: African Americans,
Hispanics, children and women.
<P>
Collectively, these populations have one thing in common -- they
are especially vulnerable to the messages promoted by these industries.
<P>
African Americans have disproportionately high rates of poverty
and poor education, and also suffer from higher rates of death,
disease and injury from alcohol and tobacco. Specifically, African-American
males are at higher risk than white males for heart disease, liver
disease and esophageal cancer, all of which are tied to cigarettes
and/or alcohol. High rates of homicide, motor-vehicle crashes,
and criminal behavior also have been linked to alcohol misuse.
<P>
Cigarette and tobacco advertising that promotes the use of these
drugs as typical of sophistication and success is concentrated
in low-income urban neighborhoods, where susceptible individuals
and groups may reside.
<P>
Individuals in inner-city neighborhoods often have little health
education, and may be less aware of the dangers of smoking and
drinking. As a group, African Americans are affected by inadequate
health care and the aggravating effects of social and economic
factors. Herein lies the vulnerability of this population.
<P>
It is no accident that research studies have found more cigarette
and alcohol billboards in predominantly black neighborhoods than
predominantly white ones.
<P>
Increased marketing of alcohol and tobacco to Hispanics can be
attributed to the changing demographics of Hispanic communities.
This population is growing rapidly, is youthful (median age =
25.5 years), diverse, and can be targeted in two different languages.
Cigarette and alcohol companies have responded with multi-million
dollar advertising campaigns promoting increased consumption,
especially among women and young people, who typically have exhibited
low rates of drinking and smoking behavior.
<P>
Although many Hispanic groups have experienced lower rates of
major chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart disease than
whites, the acculturation of Hispanics is resulting in a rise
in the prevalence of drinking and smoking.
<P>
Consequently, researchers anticipate increases in alcohol- and
tobacco-related illnesses among this group.
<P>
Women are a favorite target for many advertisers. Changes in society
have provided women with more independence and purchasing power
than in years past, and today they are bombarded with advertising
that will help them &quot;improve&quot; their independent image.
Virtually every product, from shampoo to &quot;Slim Fast,&quot;
promises women they will become more attractive, sophisticated,
desirable and physically fit.
<P>
Consistent with this market ing strategy, alcohol and tobacco
ads also promote these images, promising pleasure, fun and freedom
to the woman who smokes the right kind of cigarette or drinks
the right kind of beer.
<P>
Women comprise the fastest growing group of smokers, and lung
cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of death
from cancer in women.
<P>
Tobacco and alcohol companies realize most consumers are aware
of the risks associated with their products. Thus, advertisements
must be
<P>
psychologically appealing to perpetuate both the company's and
the consumer's denial of potential consequences of smoking and
drinking.
<P>
Advertisements targeted to women skillfully exhibit this denial.
An example of this denial mechanism was found by psychologist
Carol Moog, who reports:
<P>
&quot;Newport Stripes offers a stunning example of this kind of
psychological sleight-of-hand in an ad which has as its centerpiece
two hysterically laughing, nearly identical blonde women cuddling
big, fat, jolly snow &quot;babies&quot; on their laps. They're
little-girl-women-mommies, in exuberant good health (a glow heightened
by the intensely hot pink color of the surrounding page). Their
cigarettes are &quot;smooth and delicate&quot; (like a baby's
skin) and they are &quot;light, refreshing&quot; and (harmless)
as the candy features on their &quot;babies.&quot; Why do so many
young women smoke? For one thing, their mothers do. The messages
in this ad insidiously support continuing the habit in the next
generation by showing these delightful young mothers who enjoy
&quot;the latest in pleasure&quot; and have fine chubby children
(to whom they will pass on their addictions).&quot;
<P>
Modifications of alcohol and tobacco products and their packaging
help make smoking and drinking more &quot;female-friendly.&quot;
<P>
Companies have developed &quot;ultra light&quot; and &quot;ultra
slim&quot; cigarettes, and brands such as &quot;Eve&quot; and
&quot;Misty&quot; cigarettes have emerged. Alcohol companies have
created &quot;light beer,&quot; fruit-flavored wine coolers for
people who do not like the taste of hard liquor, and most recently,
reduced-calorie wine coolers. These products are designed to appeal
to the calorie-conscious woman. She can still drink <I>and </I>watch
her figure.
<P>
Children are the most vulnerable audience targeted by alcohol
and cigarette marketers. To maintain business growth, tobacco
companies need to initiate thousands of new smokers every day.
Hence, children frequently are exposed to tobacco ads in stores,
on billboards and incertain sports, entertainment and teen-oriented
magazines. The exposure to alcohol advertising is similar, with
the addition of television and radio exposures.
<P>
A study that examined the effects of children's exposure to TV
beer commercials found that 88 percent of fifth- and sixth-grade
students surveyed could not only identify &quot;Spuds MacKenzie,&quot;
but they also could correctly link him with Bud Light. The recent
widely publicized studies of children's recognition of Joe Camel
reiterates the fact that advertising is reaching young people.
<P>
Finding these examples is easy, but changing alcohol and tobacco
marketing strategies is comparatively difficult.
<P>
Mass media and advertising influence and sustain certain lifestyles
as much as medical technology, cultural norms and family system
values.
<P>
To combat targeted marketing of alcohol and tobacco, public concern
and awareness must be accompanied by strategies that communicate
health promotion and risk reduction messages.
<P>
Communication efforts must be comprehensive and should come from
a variety of sources, including schools, families, community organizations,
and print and broadcast media.

<H3>Tips for taking aim at the targeters: </H3>

<P>
While targeted alcohol and tobacco marketing has a pervasive influence,
effective strategies can be designed to counteract this influence.
Measures can be initiated by government agencies, community organizations,
state and local educators, businesses and church groups. Possible
strategies include:
<P>
1. Become aware of local and state advertising regulations by
contacting local zoning offices.
<P>
2. Enact and enforce zoning laws that control distribution and
operation of new alcohol and tobacco vendors in Hispanic and African-American
neighborhoods, or near schools, parks and churches.
<P>
3. Implement legislation that restricts billboards promoting alcohol
or tobacco, especially near schools or areas with high concentrations
of &quot;vulnerable&quot; populations.
<P>
4. Encourage local businesses to increase advertising to limit
the time and space available to alcohol and tobacco marketers.
<P>
5. Work with law-enforcement agencies to enforce laws prohibiting
alcohol and tobacco sales to persons not of legal purchasing age.
<P>
6. Ask community officials to enact city &quot;clean-up&quot;
and &quot;beautification&quot; acts, including elimination of
alcohol and tobacco billboards and local radio advertising of
alcohol products.
<P>
7. Lobby for removal of tobacco and alcohol advertising from sports
stadiums and mass-transit systems.
<P>
8. Involve individuals from a variety of groups (business, churches,
preservation groups, neighborhood organizations, etc.) in a coalition
against tobacco and alcohol marketing.
<P>
9. Petition outdoor advertising companies to donate billboard
space to charitable groups and voluntary health agencies for public-service
announcements.
<P>
10. Encourage local health-care providers and voluntary health
agencies to disseminate messages to the public about the risks
associated with smoking and drinking.
<P>
11. Contact local advertising agencies to initiate a counter-advertising
program that spotlights negative aspects and images of smoking
and drinking.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="indiana">Indiana one of 17 states in national anti-smoking
program</A></H3>

<P>
Indiana is one of 17 states taking part over the next seven years
in a comprehensive multi-strategy prevention initiative to reduce
the use of tobacco. The project is titled ASSIST (American Stop
Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention), a joint project
of the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society.
<P>
Project ASSIST, the United States' largest organized effort to
combat the use of tobacco, is a result of 20 years of tobacco-related
research and intervention studies.
<P>
Peter Greenwald, director of the National Cancer Institute's Division
of Cancer Prevention and Control, says, &quot;From more than 60
large intervention studies, we have learned which strategies and
approaches are most effective in controlling tobacco use. It is
time we apply these techniques as broadly as possible to prevent
smoking-related lung cancers and other diseases.&quot;
<P>
The National Cancer Institute will provide $114 million in program
support and $20 million for training, technical assistance and
evaluation. The American Cancer Society will provide $25 million
to $30 million to provide state and local coalition with staff
members, training, and materials. Additionally, the American Cancer
Society will provide access to its network of volunteers. It is
estimated more than 800,000 volunteers will be involved in Project
ASSIST.
<P>
The overall goal of ASSIST is to reduce the occurrence of cancer
and smoking-related deaths. This will be achieved by concentrating
on tobacco use, which is the greatest modifiable risk factor among
the top three leading causes of death.
<P>
Reduction of smoking prevalence among adults from 28 percent to
15 percent nationally is a specific goal of ASSIST, which also
has four main objectives: 1) To reach 91 million people (including
18 million smokers) with its messages about tobacco use; 2) To
help more than 4.5 million adults stop smoking; 3) To help 2 million
young people never start smoking; and 4) To prevent 1.2 million
people from dying prematurely as a result of smoking-related diseases.
<P>
To achieve these goals, populations at greatest risk for tobacco
use will be targeted. This includes adolescents, women, African
Americans, Hispanics, blue-collar workers, the poor and the undereducated.
<P>
Though efforts in Indiana will be statewide, most will be targeted
to four counties that give the best access to these target populations:
Allen, Lake, Marion and Vanderburgh.
<P>
Indiana Project ASSIST is a collaborative effort of the American
Cancer Society, Indiana Division, and the Indiana State Department
of Health.
<P>
Each state that has received funding will be free to design programs
and plans that work specifically in that state. For example, Indiana
is not a large tobacco-producing state, while in North Carolina,
another Project ASSIST state, tobacco is a $3 billion-a-year business
and the sole source of income for many residents. These unique
qualities will be considered as long-range plans are made.
<P>
A statewide planning coalition has been organized in Indiana.
It includes representatives from community agencies, state and
local government, schools, voluntary health organizations, hospitals
and media organizations. Each targeted local area also will form
a coalition of community leaders. The state coalition will help
with statewide plans and provide assistance to the local coalitions.
<P>
Project ASSIST will be conducted in two phases. Phase I, from
now until 1993, will focus on establishing the coalitions, which
will identify the state's high-risk smoking populations and determine
the best approach for reaching them.
<P>
In addition, the following committees will be formed: schools,
communities, worksites and health-care settings.
<P>
Each committee will work to promote tobacco-free environments
in each setting and will assess current tobacco-control strategies.
Results of these assessments will be used to develop the state's
comprehensive tobacco control plan.
<P>
Phase II will involve implementation of strategies developed in
Phase I, and will run from 1993 to 1998.
<P>
A variety of intervention strategies will be used. In the health-care
setting, providers will be given information on smoking-related
issues and trained to offer smoking-cessation courses.
<P>
Community leaders will be educated on the benefits of developing
tobacco-related public policies. These policies include such things
as restricting smoking in the workplace and schools, limiting
minors' access to cigarette vending machines, restricting smoking
in restaurants and public areas, and placing restrictions on tobacco
promotions targeting youth.
<P>
The coalitions will help establish smoking-cessation classes in
the schools and community, and work with employers to offer smoking-cessation
classes at workplaces.
<P>
Coalitions also will conduct public-service and educational campaigns
designed specifically for the targeted population in their areas.
<P>

<H3>Conflict-resolution curriculum teaches adolescents to 'win'
without violence</H3>

<P>
<I><B>Young man killed for &quot;cutting in&quot; check-out line</B></I>

<P>
<I><B>Teenager shot in back after walking away from argument</B></I>

<P>
<I><B>Young man shot after asking group to be quiet while he made
a phone call</B></I> 
<P>
Do any of these stories sound familiar? Episodes like these are
no longer isolated cases, but everyday occurrences in our society.
<P>
Over the last few years, Americans increasingly have turned to
violence to resolve arguments and interpersonal disputes. People
seem not to be interested in working out problems; instead, they
are turning to guns and weapons to &quot;win&quot; their fights.
<P>
This type of violence is occurring at an alarming rate in many
African-American communities, where murder is the No. 1 cause
of death for African-American males and females between the ages
of 15 and 34, according to <I>The Washington Post</I> While some
of these incidents may be labeled gang- or crime-related, the
fact is many of these youth are killing and being killed because
they lack basic communication and problem-solving skills.
<P>
Because of the escalating violence among this population, schools
and other organizations are adding conflict-resolution courses
to their curricula. &quot;Dealing with Anger. Givin' It, Takin'
It, and Workin' It Out&quot; is one such conflict-resolution curriculum,
and it is available from the Indiana Prevention Resource Center.
<P>
&quot;Dealing with Anger. Givin' It, Takin' It, and Workin' It
Out,&quot; produced by Norman Baxley and Associates, Inc. and
distributed by Research Press, is a videotape curriculum designed
to teach conflict-resolution skills to African-American youth.
<P>
The curriculum is divided into three parts, each of which runs
between 15 and 20 minutes. The first part, &quot;Givin' It,&quot;
is designed to teach adolescents to express their feelings to
someone without provoking an argument or fight. The second part,
&quot;Takin' It,&quot; shows youth how to take criticism and respect
the opinions of others, while maintaining self-composure and dignity
-- or in the vernacular of many adolescents, allowing them to
&quot;save face.&quot; The third part, &quot;Workin' It Out,&quot;
teaches adolescents to compromise when no other alternative is
available -- and still come out of situations as winners.
<P>
The curriculum's three skills -- giving out anger, taking anger
and working out anger -- are taught through the use of vignettes.
For each technique, the first vignette shows a typical everyday
conflict (such as someone confronting another about a rumor),
and how such a confrontation easily can turn into a heated argument
or fight.
<P>
The second vignette shows how the person can use the conflict-resolution
skill or technique in the same situation to resolve the conflict
and avoid further disputes.
<P>
In addition to vignettes, each tape shows a group of African-American
adolescent males who have watched the tapes and are practicing
the techniques. In these segments, the young men role play and
practice conflict-resolution skills using their personal experiences.
They also receive feedback from each other on how well they used
the skills and how they could improve.
<P>
These segments are useful because they show teachers how to teach
the skills in their classrooms, as well as show students how they
can apply the techniques to their everyday lives.
<P>
In addition to the videotapes, the curriculum includes a lesson
plan for teachers and group leaders.
<P>
&quot;Dealing with Anger. Givin' It, Takin' It, and Workin' It
Out&quot; is a good curriculum because it is realistic and specifically
designed to meet the needs of African-American youth. Unlike some
&quot;culturally sensitive&quot; educational materials that end
up stereotyping an entire culture and insulting their audiences,
this series uses a variety of vignettes to show ordinary people
in everyday situations that any audience is comfortable relating
to.
<P>
One important group of skills that could have been included in
this series are skills to weigh the benefits and costs of becoming
involved in certain conflicts --skills to determine which battles
are worth fighting, and which ones are not. These skills should
be addressed in this series and in all
<P>
conflict-resolution courses. Today, adolescents must be able to
make immediate decisions and answer questions such as: Is hitting
this person worth going to jail? Is this argument worth getting
shot? Is it better for me to walk away from a fight, or be kicked
out of school? Combining these quick decision-making skills with
the conflict-resolution skills presented in the videotapes would
give adolescents additional tools to avoid violent confrontations.
<P>
The most valuable lesson adolescents can learn from conflict-resolution
courses is that controlling their behavior is more important than
controlling the actions of others. Most often, the one who can
maintain his or her behavior can control the situation without
resorting to violence. Adolescents need to understand that the
&quot;winner&quot; is not always the one who has the gun, but
the one who can sense a bad situation and leave before the gun
goes off.
<P>
In addition, youth need to understand that life is important and
that saving their lives is far more important than &quot;saving
face.&quot; Adolescents must know they have the ability and right
to choose many situations they are in, and that they have the
power to turn a negative, volatile situation into nonviolent one.<I>
</I>
<P>
Conflict-resolution courses not only can be taught in schools,
but also can be used by other organizations. For example, churches,
boys' and girls' clubs, big brother/big sister organizations and
other community-based programs can incorporate conflict-resolution
skills development into their programming. National Black fraternities
and sororities that are known for their educational and skills
development efforts among African-Americans also can use these
courses to better serve their communities.
<P>
&quot;Dealing with Anger. Givin' It, Takin'It, and Workin' It
Out&quot; and other conflict-resolution courses are good first
steps to developing and improving good communication skills among
adolescents, particularly African-American youth. However, we
must remember behaviors and skills take time and practice to develop.
One course is not enough. To decrease this surge in violence,
communities and schools must make communication and problem-solving
skills an integral part of school and other organizational curricula.
By making these skills a normal and expected part of adolescent
behavior, we can see this pattern of violence end.

<H3>Reorganization aimed at improving federal prevention and treatment
efforts </H3>

<H3>Federal AOD agencies reorganized</H3>

<P>
The alphabet soup of acronyms for federal alcohol and other drug
prevention and treatment agencies has been rearranged. Forget
ADAMHA and OSAP and OTI, and learn SAMHSA, CSAT, CSAP, and CMHS
instead. On October 1, 1992, federal agencies that deal with alcohol
and other drug issues were reorganized as part of the federal
government's effort to strengthen prevention and treatment of
addictive and mental disorders.
<P>
The <B>Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration</B>
(ADAMHA) was reorganized into a new health-service agency called
the <B>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</B>
(SAMHSA) within the U.S. Public Health Service of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
<P>
The SAMHSA mission is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of
alcohol and other drug use and mental disorders, improve treatment
outcomes for persons suffering from these disorders, and diminish
consequences for their families and communities.
<P>
As mandated by the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, SAMHSA will
consist of three centers: the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment
(CSAT), the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) and the
Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS). Coordination will be
provided by the Office of the Administrator.
<P>
Three research institutes that were part of ADAMHA when it was
created in 1974 have been transferred to the National Institutes
of Health. These institutes are the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
(NIAAA), and National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).
<P>
<B>The new centers</B> 
<P>
The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) will administer
the block grant for the prevention and treatment of alcohol and
other drug use, and will continue to administer other treatment
programs begun by its predecessor organization, the ADAMHA Office
for Treatment Improvement (OTI), which aimed at enhancing the
quality of alcohol and other drugs treatment systems nationwide.
<P>
The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS)- an entirely new
entity-has been established to create a focus for increased federal
attention on issues related to mental health services across the
United States. The Center's overall objective is to assist the
States in providing access to treatment, prevention and rehabilitation
services while reducing the impact of these devastating illnesses
on families and communities.
<P>
The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) replaces the
Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) and will administer
several of the programs previously run by OSAP, including the
two major funding programs -- the Community Partnership and the
High Risk Youth grant programs. The new legislation also authorizes
CSAP to help small business employers who cannot afford Employee
Assistance Programs to establish them.
<P>
The mission of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)
is to support, advocate and promote the continued development
of community, state, national and international comprehensive
prevention systems. CSAP connects people and resources with innovative
ideas, strategies and programs designed to encourage creative
and effective efforts aimed at reducing and eliminating alcohol,
tobacco and other drug problems in our society. CSAP also provides
federal leadership to support, stimulate and create partnerships
at all levels and with all sectors of the society to create a
holistic prevention agenda designed to strengthen the nation's
capacity to foster healthy individuals, families, organizations,
institutions and communities, especially among those at risk.
<P>
<B>CSAP will administer several programs including:</B> 
<P>
--the existing Community Partnership Demonstration program, which
is given authorization by the new law;
<P>
--the existing High Risk Youth Prevention Demonstration Program;
<P>
--the existing Substance Abuse Preventions Conference Grant Program;
<P>
--newly authorized Employee Assistance Programs;
<P>
--a new national data base on prevention, including the National
Clearinghouse for Alcohol and other Drug Information (NCADI)
<P>
--the existing Communications Cooperative Agreement Program; and
<P>
--prevention components of its previous training initiative.
<P>
<B>CSAP is also required to:</B> 
<P>
1. Sponsor regional workshops on the prevention of drug and alcohol
abuse;
<P>
2. Coordinate the findings of research sponsored by Public Health
Service Agencies on drug and alcohol abuse prevention;
<P>
3. Establish effective drug and alcohol abuse prevention literature;
<P>
4. Disseminate prevention materials to states, localities and
school systems, in conjunction with the Department of Education;
<P>
5. Support clinical training programs for alcohol and other drugs
counselors and health professionals serving in the drug abuse
education and prevention fields;
<P>
6. Create educational materials to reduce alcohol and other drug
users' risks of acquiring HIV, in coordination with the Centers
for Disease Control;
<P>
7. Carry out training, technical assistance, data collection and
evaluation of Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act programs;
<P>
8. Strengthen the development of innovative, community-based model
programs to prevent alcohol and other drug use and abuse among
youth;
<P>
9. Develop and distribute documentary films and public-service
announcements for television and radio to educate the general
public about the dangers of drugs;
<P>
10. Establish and fund demonstration grants to identify and discourage
the improper use or abuse of anabolic steroids by students, particular
high school students.
<P>
Additionally, CSAP has been charged with the mission of developing
a national data base on alcohol and other drugs prevention programs.
The data base will be developed from information currently held
by the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information
(NCADI). CSAP will also continue to design,
<P>
implement and evaluate innovative knowledge transfer and communication
strategies. This will include the continued operation of a national
clearinghouse for alcohol and drug information.
<P>
CSAP will administer two major grant programs carried over from
the former office for Substance Abuse Prevention. These are the
<I> Community Partnership Program</I> and the <I>High Risk Youth
Program</I>.
<P>
<I>The Community Partnership Program</I> assists community coalitions
to develop partnerships of agencies and organizations to take
a systematic approach to the prevention of alcohol and other drug
abuse. An appropriation of up to $120 million is authorized for
fiscal year 1993.
<P>
<I>The High Risk Youth Prevention Demonstration Grant Program</I>
is targeted at youth who are at risk of alcohol or other drug
use. It is reauthorized with a new requirement that grantees focus
on reducing tobacco, as well as illegal alcohol and other drug
use, among high risk youth. Up to $70 million is authorized for
fiscal year 1993.
<P>
A new provision authorizes CSAP to help Employee Assistance Programs
(EAPs) through grants to public and private nonprofit groups to
aid small business employers who are without EAPs to establish
them. Special consideration will be given to businesses with 50
or fewer employees. Up to $3 million is authorized for fiscal
year 1993.
<P>
<B>New special interest offices</B> 
<P>
Two new offices have been established to track special issues:
<I>The Office of Applied Science</I> and <I>The Office for Women's
Services.</I> <I>The Office of Applied Studies</I> (OAS), in the
Office of the Administration, was formed to serve as the focal
point for SAMSHA's data gathering analysis and dissemination activities.
<P>
Among its important functions, the Office will oversee key agency
alcohol and other drug use surveys, with the specific responsibility
for the annual <I>National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</I>,
and the <I>DAWN (Drug Abuse Warning Network) Survey</I>, both
previously administered under the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
<P>
<I>DAWN</I> is a national system in which data are collected on
drug abuse episodes from emergency rooms and medical examiner
facilities across the country. <I>DAWN</I> data are available
quarterly.
<P>
<I>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse</I> is an annual
prevalence survey that includes people 12 years of age in the
United States.
<P>
OAS will evaluate the relevance of the findings of those and other
major national surveys to the activities of SAMHSA components,
the Department of Health and Humans Services and the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy, and will interpret them
for the public.
<P>
Another vital function of this new office is the coordination
of all Agency evaluation programs. OAS will work with SAMHSA components
to develop evaluation goals and facilitate development of agency
evaluation efforts.
<P>
The special needs of women will be the focus of activity of a
new SAMHSA <I>Office for Women's Services</I> (OWS). Under the
direction of an Associate Administrator, the office will lead
agency efforts to address issues involved in providing alcohol
and other drugs and mental health services for women-medical care,
psychological treatment, social services, an establishment of
necessary links to jobs, housing and transportation.
<P>
The primary care needs of substance-abusing mothers and their
children also will be addressed, as well as the unique needs of
minority women, including Native American, Hispanic, African American
and Asian women.
<P>
The office will enhance the collection of data on women's health
by developing standardized data-collection programs and assuring
that data are made accessible to health providers, researchers
and the public. The office also will ensure the establishment
of an information program on women's alcohol and other drugs and
mental health services.
<P>
In addition, working with an Agency Coordination Committee, the
new women's services office will identify program gaps, recommend
policy, and coordinate and promote collaboration among the three
SAMSHSA Centers, and with other U.S. Public Health Service components.

<H3>PRIMER ON PREVENTION FUNDING: PART I</H3>

<H3>Develop strategies for funding drug prevention programs </H3>

<P>
<I>&quot;Do you know what makes these birds [America's first spacecraft]
fly? Funding makes these birds fly! No bucks, no Buck Rogers!&quot;</I>

<P>
<I>-</I>Mercury astronauts speaking to the rocket
<P>
scientists in the movie <I>The Right Stuff</I> 
<P>
The <I>Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986</I>, and other federal and
state initiatives, helped to stimulate interest in preventing
alcohol and other drug problems. Over the past five years, tens
of thousands of drug prevention programs have emerged in communities
across the country. As these programs mature, and as new programs
develop, many prevention practitioners have shifted their attention
to generating adequate funding to operate these programs.
<P>
Unfortunately, just like the spacecraft referred to by the Mercury
astronauts, it takes funding to make most drug prevention programs
&quot;fly.&quot; Many prevention practitioners have little experience
in locating and raising the funding they need to keep their programs
going.
<P>
This is the first of a series of three &quot;On Prevention&quot;
columns in <I>Prevention Newsline</I> that will focus on funding
drug prevention activities.
<P>
One of the biggest mistakes that prevention practitioners make
in developing a funding strategy is to <B>overestimate</B> their
chances of receiving funding from federal and state sources and
to <B>underestimate</B> their chances of receiving funding from
local sources in their own community. As a general rule, the chances
for successful funding are better the closer the funding source
is to their home community.
<P>
While the lure of large federal budgets may entice many people
to apply for federal grants, most of these programs fund fewer
than 5% of all applications they receive.
<P>
<B>Federal funding</B> for drug prevention activities falls into
two general categories: block grants to states, and competitive
grants to individual programs. The largest share of federal funding
is distributed through block grants to states. In most federal
agencies, competitive grants account for less than 10% of their
total prevention funding.
<P>
<B>Federal block grants</B> are distributed through designated
state agencies. Each federal agency utilizes a parallel state
agency to distribute its block grants in a given state. For example,
the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health block grants are administered
in Indiana by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration
- Division of Mental Health.
<P>
Block grants are intended to provide funding assistance for general
operating expenses of local programs that do not involve a &quot;compelling
federal interest.&quot; Only programs that involve a compelling
federal interest are eligible for most competitive grant programs.
<P>
In some cases, federal laws or regulations establish a formula
for the distribution of block grant funds. About 70% of the Drug-Free
Schools block grant funds for the state of Indiana are distributed
to local school districts according to a formula based upon census
data. School corporations that comply with the minimum requirements
for funding receive their share of the block grant funds as an
&quot;entitlement.&quot; Only qualifying local education agencies
(school corporations) are entitled to apply for these funds, and
the Indiana Department of Education distributes application information
directly to all eligible school corporations.
<P>
The balance of the Drug-Free Schools block grant is awarded to
local projects via several different programs - some coordinated
by the Indiana Department of Education, and some by the Division
of Mental Health. In some cases, federal law restricts eligibility
to receive funding to local education agencies, while in other
cases, a wide range of community agencies are eligible to apply.
<P>
In Indiana, all applications for federal block grant money to
fund alcohol and other drug programs that is not distributed as
an entitlement require review by the appropriate <B>Local Coordinating
Council (LCC)</B> of the Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free
Indiana. Since some of these programs provide a multi-year funding
commitment to successful applicants, not all programs receive
applications every year.
<P>
The best source of information about available block grant funding
is your <B>Regional Coordinating Office (RCO)</B> of the Governor's
Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana. To have any realistic chance
of receiving these funds, you must work through their Local Coordinating
Councils. Each RCO will receive information about all of the current
block grant programs that are accepting applications.
<P>
<B>Federal competitive grants</B> (sometimes called &quot;discretionary
grants&quot;) generally are restricted to programs that address
some problem of &quot;compelling federal interest.&quot; Examples
of such interest include: &quot;research projects&quot; that are
designed to develop new strategies for preventing alcohol and
other drug problems, &quot;demonstration projects&quot; that apply
the findings from research and demonstrate the effectiveness (or
lack thereof) of new strategies, projects that target groups of
special interest to the federal government (such as Native Americans,
&quot;high risk youth,&quot; etc.), projects that serve nationwide
populations, and programs that address emerging or special priority
issues (such as AIDS/drug prevention).
<P>
A very few federal programs (such as the ACTION Drug Alliance
program, and the FIPSE institution wide program for colleges and
universities) provide one-time start-up funds for routine local
programs.
<P>
All of the competitive federal grants require very detailed applications,
are highly competitive, must be based upon solid prevention theory,
and must have elaborate evaluation plans. For most local prevention
programs, the type of evaluation required would require hiring
an outside evaluation consultant.
<P>
Most federal drug prevention grant awards are in the $100,000+
range. With the exception of the ACTION Drug Alliance Grants,
very few awards are for less than $50,000. Smaller grant requests
often are referred to block grant programs.
<P>
A few federal programs accept applications for review year-round
(although the reviews occur only three times per year), but most
have one application deadline per year. Application deadlines
are strictly enforced.
<P>
Federal grants usually require audited financial statements and
strict fiscal controls. Often, local prevention programs must
apply using a local government agency as the official applicant,
since most non-profit agencies do not have the level of financial
control required for federal grants.
<P>
Preparation of a federal grant proposal may take a first-time
applicant six to nine months of work. Since applications often
are accepted only once per year, a 12 to 18 month lead time from
starting the application to the time of the award would not be
unusual.
<P>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center now provides intensive
grantwriting assistance to help local prevention programs prepare
applications for federal grants.
<P>
Most <B>state funding</B> for drug prevention activities involve
either state awards of federal block grant funding, or funds provided
under the <B>Drug-Free Indiana</B> program.
<P>
The <B>Drug-Free Indiana</B> grants are funded from fees collected
from defendants convicted of alcohol or drunk driving offenses.
Each person convicted is assessed a fee of $200, $90 of which
goes into a state-level fund and $90 of which goes into a local
fund. Each of these funds makes awards to local alcohol and other
drug programs in prevention and education, treatment, and law
enforcement.
<P>
All applications for Drug-Free Indiana funding must be reviewed
and prioritized by the appropriate Local Coordinating Council
(LCC) for each community being served. Local awards are made by
county governments based upon LCC recommendations. State-level
awards are made by the Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free Indiana,
in cooperation with other state agencies involved in alcohol and
other drug issues, based upon LCC and state-level review committee
recommendations. Some state awards are funded by the <B>Hoosier
Alliance Against Drugs</B>, again using the LCC review process
as the starting point.
<P>
Applicants seeking state grants should contact their Regional
Coordinating Office (RCO) of the Governor's Commission for a Drug-Free
Indiana for further information.
<P>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center can provide some basic
assistance in locating state funding, but our intensive grantwriting
assistance program is limited to federal and foundation grant
applications.
<P>
In the next issue of <I>Prevention Newsline</I>, &quot;On Prevention&quot;
will focus on private sector funding.

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Maybe you go to a party where there are drugs and alcohol. Maybe you get high, and your thinking gets muddy.  That's when you do something stupid, something you wouldn't normally do, like have sex without a latex condom.</P>

<P>It's so easy to forget to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases when you aren't thinking clearly.  When your judgement is gone you may not even care that AIDS is fatal.</P>

<P>Maybe you rationalize away the problem:  "AIDS? Not her -- she comes from a good family."  Or, "Anyone can see he's clean-cut."  But you can't tell someone has HIV, the AIDS virus, just by looking.</P>

<P>It's tough to do the right thing, especially if you're high.  Even if you don't drink excessively or use drugs, you always need protection when you have sex.  As long as HIV can be passed sexually, sex with one person is like sex with all their previous partners.</P>

<P>It's a dilemma:  just when you want to let go, you need to hold back.  You need to keep a clear head.  How can you do that and still party?  The ideas on the following pages will help you handle situations where you want to have fun but don't want to get messed up by alcohol or other drugs.</P>

<H3>Strategies for safe partying.</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=100%>

<P>People are practicing new ways to protect themselves.<BR>
Try a few, to find what works for you.</P>

"Hang out with people who don't take chances." -- Kris R.</P>

<P>"Plan <I>not </I>to get high and stick to it.  Do whatever it takes to help you remember."  -- Dan C.</P>

<P>"Don't have sex on a night you're partying." -- Chuck M.</P>

<P>"Party where you know people don't use drugs." -- Tony D.</P>

<P>"Believe in yourself, that's a real help." -- Salome B.</P>

<P>"Carry a condom, use a condom." -- Alicia Z.</P>

<H3>Learn you can depend on others by depending on others.</H3>

<P><I>The Buddy System </I>-- a big idea from Miami, FL. Team up with a friend.  Use a code word to remind each other when it's time to switch to soda or call it a night.</P>

<H3>What would you do?</H3>
<OL>
<LI>You're partying and you meet someone you like, do you --<BR>
a.  go home with the person immediately?<BR>
b. hang out and try to keep a clear head?<BR>
c. make a date for tomorrow to see the person in the sober light of day?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>  You're at a party that suddenly takes a turn for the worse, do you --<BR>
a. hang around to watch how bad things get?<BR>
b. find you can't leave because you stayed too long?<BR>
c. leave?
</OL>

<H3>Simple hints for keeping a clear head.</H3>
<P>
Don't drink excessively or use drugs.  <BR>
Eat something before partying. <BR>
Munch something during partying. <BR>
Less alcohol, more soda. <BR>
Add more ice.  Much more ice. <BR>
Sip slowly, don't gulp. <BR>
Avoid straws.<BR>
Give yourself a chance to see the person in the non-partying light of day. </P>

<H3>If getting high is part of the social and romantic fabric of your life, you can do better.</H3>

<P>A. No one needs to get high to be attrative to anyone else.</P>
<P>B. Figure out what you want from your social life.  Meet the person of your dreams?  Find someone to have fun with tomorrow?  Kick back, relax, hang out with a group?  Knowing what you want helps you  make the right choices. </P>
<P>C. Think about modifying your partying for a good time without putting yourself at risk. (A party situation isn't necessarily an out of control situation). </P>
<P>D. Talk openly with friends about what they do to keep from getting high and risking AIDS. </P>

<H3>Planning a &quot;social&quot; marketing campaign involves
six steps </H3>

<H3>Prevention can learn from business</H3>

<P>
The Swedish Bikini Team, Spuds Mackenzie, Old Joe, &quot;Give
Me a Light&quot; or &quot;Tastes Great: Less Filling&quot; are
all familiar and powerful communication tools used to market legal
drugs -- alcohol and tobacco -- in the United States. The success
represented by these marketing campaigns depends on strategic
planning and research.
<P>
While such planning and research is routine in the marketing of
products and services by the private sector, only recently have
marketing concepts been applied to health and other social issues.
That application is referred to as &quot;social&quot; marketing,
which the United States Public Health Service began to use in
the 1980s when developing and reviewing campaigns for alcohol
and other drug prevention programs and messages. Social marketing
is now part of the technical assistance trainings and consultations
offered by the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention to communities
and agencies working in the alcohol and other drug use prevention
field.
<P>
When planning programs or awareness campaigns, it is essential
that an emphasis is placed on the audience's needs. Just as commercial
marketers take the time to know the audience so they can sell
beer or cigarettes, so must those in the alcohol and other drug
field get to know the audience. Programs and messages then can
be targeted specifically to the intended audience, and impact
of the programs or messages not only will be greater, but will
have a greater likelihood of having the desired impact.
<P>
To market alcohol and other drug prevention programs, the planner
should borrow the the four P's used by marketers: <B>product</B>,
<B>price</B>, <B>place </B>and <B>promotion</B>.
<P>
In health communications, these concepts take on the following
meanings:
<P>
<B>PRODUCT </B>is knowledge, attitudes or behavior you want the
audience to adopt.
<P>
<B>PRICE, </B>unlike in commercial marketing, is not monetary.
Instead price in health communication is what audience members
must give up to receive the program's benefits.
<P>
<B>PROMOTION </B>is the means for persuading the target audience
that the product is worth the price.
<P>
<B>PLACE </B>refers to how the message is disseminated, such as
through electronic or print media, billboards or community programs.
<P>
For example, the <B>product</B> a prevention program wants its
teen audience to adopt could be refusing to drink with peers.
The <B>price</B> for adopting that product could be the risk of
not fitting in with one's peers. <B>Promotion</B> could stress
that not drinking is &quot;smart&quot; behavior, and <B>place</B>
could be a mass media campaign.
<P>
Planning alcohol and other drug communication programs can be
broken down into six stages.
<P>
<B>STAGE 1: PLANNING AND SELECTING STRATEGY </B>
<P>
This stage provides the foundation for the entire social marketing
process. An assessment of the problem, the target<B> </B>audience
and the available resources is conducted before moving ahead.
During this planning process, the target audience should become
increasingly segmented. This segmentation will aid in the development
of appropriate messages. Goals and objectives for the program
will be developed at this time. These will shape the program as
planners progress through the stages.
<P>
<B>STAGE 2: SELECTING CHANNELS AND MATERIALS</B> 
<P>
Channels are how the message will be delivered, whether it be
face-to-face, group, mass media, community activities or a combination
of channels. The more channels selected, the more the target audience
will be exposed to the message. Determining the channel prior
to producing materials is important because different materials
work in different channels.
<P>
Material selection involves using what you have learned about
your target audience to your advantage. Time and money can be
saved by selecting materials that are specific to the audience
you are trying to reach. You would no more use coloring sheets
for adults than you would use a 10-page booklet filled with technical
terms for second graders.
<P>
When selecting materials, choose things that can be reproduced
within your budget in the needed quantity. A booklet with four-color
photographs might be terrific, but can you get out the same message
using two-color drawings?
<P>
Not all materials have to be developed from scratch; many free
materials are available to communities from a variety of organizations.
<P>
The Indiana Prevention Resource Center can serve as an excellent
source for prevention materials. In addition to the PRC's library
of print and audio-visual materials, the PRC serves as the state
RADAR site for Indiana. Bulk quantities of most materials produced
by the government are available in stock or can be ordered.
<P>
<B>STAGE 3: DEVELOPING MATERIALS AND PRETESTING</B> 
<P>
Begin by developing a draft of materials, then pretest them with
your target audience. Determine if materials get the intended
results, or revise them accordingly. This process should be repeated
until all involved are satisfied with the end product.
<P>
It is important to determine the number of times materials will
be pretested before being produced as final products, because
pretesting does add time to the project and does require some
expenses. It can, however, save money in the long run, helping
avoid the pitfalls of programs that spend their entire materials
budget on one great idea and produce materials, only to find that
the target audience does not understand the point of the materials.
<P>
<B>STAGE 4: IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM</B> 
<P>
All materials for the communication program should be ready and
available in sufficient quantities before the start of the program.
A method for tracking and evaluating the program should be in
place before the kick-off.
<P>
The tracking method will allow you not only to see where your
<P>
program is succeeding, but allow you to identify areas where changes
are needed. The most successful programs are always being updated
with current information about the program and about the target
audience.
<P>
The appropriate evaluation type to use is process evaluation,
which requires looking at the steps involved with the program,
such as the number of times a public-service announcement is aired,
the use of clipping services or an inventory of the materials
on hand.
<P>
It is during the implementation stage that the use of intermediaries
is effective. Intermediaries are those people who have contact
with and influence on your target audience, and can serve as spokespersons
for your program. The best intermediary will change with each
program and target audience, but intermediaries are generally
from outside your agency. If intermediaries' views are so different
from that of the program developer that despite their standing
with the target group, they will be detrimental to the goals of
the program, they probably should not be used.
<P>
<B>STAGE 5: ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS</B> 
<P>
Assessment of the effectiveness of the program in this stage goes
beyond the process evaluation of the previous stage. Here, how
the program is affecting beliefs, attitudes and/or behaviors of
the target audience is measured. It is important to note that
<P>
evaluation of the program should be conceived during the initial
stage, although not conducted until this stage. The type of evaluation
conducted at this stage will depend upon several factors, including:
money, time, policies regarding the ability to gather information,
the level of support for evaluation and the overall design of
the program.
<P>
Four types of evaluation generally are used in health communications:
formative, process, outcome and impact.
<P>
<B>FORMATIVE EVALUATION </B>includes pretesting of materials and
is designed to test the strengths and weaknesses of a program
before it is ready for implementation. It is used in stages one
through three.
<P>
<B>PROCESS EVALUATION </B>basically reviews the tasks of implementing
the program.
<P>
<B>OUTCOME EVALUATION </B>is used to gather descriptive information.
It gathers information about knowledge and attitude changes, expressed
intentions of the target audience and the initiation of policy
changes.
<P>
<B>IMPACT EVALUATION</B>, which is the most comprehensive of the
four types of evaluation, focuses on the long-term outcomes of
the program. It measures such things as changes in morbidity and
mortality, long-term maintenance of behavior change and changes
in absenteeism from work or school. Impact evaluations are seldom
done for communication programs because of such factors as their
cost and/or the time it takes to conduct them. Impact evaluation
most often is used in a multi-faceted health-education program
that includes awareness, education, training and communication
programs.
<P>
<B>STAGE 6: REFINING THROUGH FEEDBACK</B> 
<P>
If the program is to be continued, revisions of the program should
be undertaken. If this is the end of the program, documentation
of what was learned should be made so as to assist others who
may undertake a similar project in the future. Whether the program
continues or ends, an evaluation report should be prepared. The
report may be formal and contain charts, graphs and materials
samples, or it may be as simple as a letter to the board or peers
in similar situations. The report can be used to secure funding
to continue the program, assist others conducting similar activities,
or help document that you have the ability to conduct programs.
<P>
The use of the six stages of health communication can be used
to break a large program into small manageable parts.
<P>
For a program to succeed and have an effect on alcohol and other
drug issues in a community, it must be planned for the target
audience, just as the tobacco and alcoholic beverage companies
plan their advertising programs around their target audiences.
<P>
If beer sales declined during campaigns featuring the Swedish
Bikini Team, Stroh Brewery Co. would not spend millions of dollars
a year researching and developing campaigns around the concept.
Therefore, it is important that those working to prevent illegal
alcohol and other drug use learn the lesson being taught by the
experts and use the same weapons: know your audience, identify
your product, determine the price, find a place and promote the
product.

<P>
<I>Seeking feedback an important part of communication</I> <HR>

<a name="communication">
<H3>Planning key to good communication research </H3>

<P>
Communication is <B>not</B> a one-way process. That's why communicating
prevention messages about illegal alcohol and other drug use must
involve more than simply sending messages. You -- the <B>sender</B>
-- must insure that your audience -- the <B>receiver</B> -- accurately
understands your message. You must pay attention to that part
of the communication process known as <B>feedback</B>. In other
words, you may need to do some research.
<P>
Research can range from informal chats with your program's patrons
to the kind of formal and systematic research program that is
favored by the corporate and academic worlds.
<P>
Successful businesses, in fact, spend millions of dollars to employ
their own research professionals or hire outside research firms
and consultants to monitor all aspects of business communications,
whether they be the messages sent by television commercials, highway
billboards, company letterhead or corporate news releases.
<P>
Although most prevention programs won't have the money or the
expertise to engage in the kind of systematic research used in
the corporate and academic realms, there are some research techniques
that can be borrowed successfully by prevention professionals.
And prevention programs should not overlook community resources
that can help with a communications research effort. Many college
business and communications faculty, for example, look for small
organizations that can provide real-world marketing research projects
for students.
<P>
However you obtain research, it's helpful to be informed about
the basics. What follows is a quick look at the research process,
and it is crucial to view research as a process involving several
steps, not as a quick fix. Four steps in marketing research are
outlined by authorities Philip Kotler, who is Harold T. Martin
Professor of Marketing at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management
at Chicago's Northwestern University, and Gary Armstrong, professor
of marketing in the School of Business Administration at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Kotler and Armstrong's four
steps are:
<P>
<B>1. Defining the problem and research objectives.</B> 
<P>
<B>2. Developing the research plan.</B> 
<P>
<B>3. Implementing the research plan, collecting and analyzing
information.</B> 
<P>
<B>4. Interpreting and reporting the findings.</B> 
<P>
<B>DEFINE THE PROBLEM AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</B> 
<P>
This may be the hardest aspect of marketing research, but it's
also the most important. For instance, if you've tried several
new techniques to promote the services of your program but find
the use of those services is decreasing, you should decide what
you want to know before you spend time and/or money on research.
<P>
Do you want to explore whether your program might better serve
a different clientele? Do you want to describe the clientele your
program currently serves? Or do you want to learn what techniques
-- newspaper, radio, word-of-mouth, for example -- are best suited
for reaching your clientele? Defining your problem and the objectives
you want to achieve through re-
<P>
search will help insure the suc-
<P>
cess of that research, and ultimately the success of the messages
you communicate.
<P>
<B>DEVELOP THE</B> <B>RESEARCH PLAN</B> 
<P>
This is the point at which you identify what information is needed
to achieve your objectives and determine how it can be collected.
<P>
<B>1. Determine the specific information you need.</B> 
<P>
For instance, if your goal is to find out if your after-school
program is best serving elementary-school students in your community
who are at risk for alcohol and drug use, you may need several
kinds of information, such as: Where are the students who aren't
in your program currently going after school? Are their parents
interested in after-school programming for their children? How
could you reach those parents? What kinds of messages should you
be sending teachers and school administrators?
<P>
The answers you give to these questions will dictate the kind
of information you need to seek.
<P>
<B>2. Look for previously collected, or secondary, information
that will meet your needs.</B> 
<P>
Secondary information -- whether you find your organization already
has it or you have to search for it externally -- could include
government publications such as census and statistical reports,
or periodicals and books relevant to your topic.
<P>
The advantage of secondary information is its ability to provide
information you could not collect on your own because time, technique
or expense would make collecting the information a prohibitive
task for you.
<P>
One external source of secondary information not to overlook is
the Indiana Prevention Resource Center. We have useful materials
in our library, or our professional prevention staff members can
refer you to other sources of information.
<P>
<B>3. Plan to collect any additional, or primary, information
you need, using a single technique or a combination of technique,
including:</B> 
<P>
<B>a. Observation.</B> 
<P>
To use this research technique, identify the people, actions and
situations that are germane to your task and observe them. That
may mean observing the flow of traffic through the neighborhoods
where you plan to post billboards, counting the number of fliers
picked up by students who visit your booth at a school health
fair, or listening to the laughter or groans of an audience gathered
to watch a videotape.
<P>
Keep in mind that while observation can be relatively quick and
easy, it does not lend itself to all situations. Some things,
like attitudes or long-term response, can't be observed. Realize,
too, that the presence of an observer can affect the behavior
of people being observed.
<P>
<B>b. Mail, telephone or in-person surveys.</B> 
<P>
These can be structured mail surveys that pose formal lists of
questions or unstructured personal surveys that probe for issues
related to the research topic. Whatever form they take, surveys
are familiar to us all; they're the most frequently employed means
of gathering research information. Check the PRC library or your
local public or college library for the many books that can help
you assess such issues as the cost of different types of surveys
or the merits of using one type of question over another.
<P>
<B>c. Focus groups.</B> 
<P>
These are small gatherings of people who meet with a trained moderator
to share what they think about program themes, messages and products.
(To learn more about conducting focus groups, see the article
on page 6.)
<P>
<B>4. Present your plan to others for evaluation.</B> 
<P>
Discussing your proposed plan with others certainly will increase
the chance that you won't waste time and/or money on collecting
information that turns out to be inappropriate.
<P>
<B>IMPLEMENT THE RESEARCH PLAN, COLLECTING AND ANALYZING INFORMATION</B>

<P>
When you've prepared a plan and you know what information you
need, it's time to put your plan into action.
<P>
Because the actual collection of information can be the most expensive
phase of research, particularly if your research effort were to
involve a technique such as telephone interviews conducted by
an outside research firm, it's important that you monitor the
collection of information.
<P>
Analysis of information can be expensive, as well as time-consuming.
For example, analysis might involve coding and keying questionnaire
answers into a computer program that will allow the researcher
to tabulate and analyze results. Even if significant time and
money are not involved in the analysis phase, it's important that
analysis be done carefully.
<P>
<B>INTERPRET AND REPORT THE FINDINGS</B> 
<P>
At this point, you're ready to interpret what you've found and
draw conclusions. To guard against any of your own biases creeping
into your interpretations and conclusions, it's important that
you check your judgments with others. Checking your research with
others also can ensure you haven't overlooked key details in the
information you've collected.
<P>
Carefully planned research, whether low-budget efforts done by
volunteers or high-dollar systematic programs carried out by professionals,
will help you insure the effectiveness of the prevention messages
you communicate about illegal alcohol and other drug use.

<P>
Resistance training builds resilience in youth
<P>
Resilient children are like the watches in the old Timex commercials
- &quot;they take a licking and keep on ticking.&quot;
<P>
We can build resilience - the ability to avoid problems despite
exposure to overwhelming &quot;risk factors&quot; - by exposing
youth to programs that emphasize &quot;protective factors.&quot;
Protective factors may include strong role models, educational
success, family bonds, and skills to resist peer and social pressures.
<P>
Teaching specific social skills about how to resist peer and social
pressures to use alcohol and other drugs is an important resilience-
building strategy. Youth need to learn how to &quot;say no&quot;
without losing friends and how to avoid being influenced by social
pressures such as those exerted by the advertising, news media
and entertainment industries. Curricula that develop resilience
through protective factors are in place in several Indiana schools.
<P>
In Indiana, <B>PROJECT I-STAR</B> and <B>D.A.R.E.</B> are two
such programs that develop personal and social skills to help
children cope with pressures to use alcohol and other drugs. Both
PROJECT I-STAR (Indiana Students Taught Awareness and Resistance)
and D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) target children
making the transition from elementary school to junior-high school.
D.A.R.E. is presented to students in fifth and/or sixth grade
who will enter junior high the following year, while I-STAR is
presented in the first two years of junior high, generally grades
seven and eight.
<P>
<B>Project I-STAR</B>, modeled after California's <B>Project SMART</B>,
was developed by the University of California's Institute for
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research to provide a
school and community approach in the prevention of alcohol and
other drug abuse among youth. In 1987, working cooperatively with
Lilly Endowment, Inc., Marion County Public Schools established
Project I-STAR, which began as the <B>Project STAR</B> curriculum
Kansas City schools patterned after California's Project SMART.
<P>
In 1990, Project I-Star received the United States Secretary of
Health and Human Services Excellence in Prevention Award and the
American Medical Association's Adolescent Health Congress Award.
<P>
I-STAR is a school-based program designed to involve an entire
community. The program encourages involvement of local media,
businesses, religious groups, youth agencies, government, medical
institutions and parent groups. A parents' committee is established
in each I-STAR school to support the program's goals. Through
these committees, prevention messages from the curriculum are
passed on to other parents and community members. Parental involvement
also is solicited through student homework assignments in the
I-STAR curriculum. Assignments are designed for parent and child
to work on together, and when an assignment is completed, both
parent and child sign it before it is turned in at school.
<P>
The I-STAR curriculum can be integrated into most subject areas,
including science, health, social studies or language arts. A
special supplement is available to teachers who work with special-needs
students.
<P>
Regular classroom teachers, who attend a training workshop before
teaching the program, present the curriculum to students in two
parts. Part I is<B> </B>presented in the first year and consists
of 13 sessions, including sessions such as &quot;Techniques to
Say 'No,'&quot; &quot;Peer Pressure Resistance,&quot; &quot;Advertising
Influences&quot; and &quot;Developing Friendships.&quot; Part
II is presented the following year. After a review of the previous
year is conducted, Part II sessions focus on such topics as &quot;Problem
Solving,&quot; &quot;Refusal Skills&quot; and &quot;Family Interaction
Skills.&quot;
<P>
Before the beginning of each session, students from each class
are chosen to participate in skill leaders training and serve
as leaders for their classes. As skill leaders, students assist
their teachers in demonstrating skills being addressed in each
session. In addition, because one of the most powerful influences
on anyone, especially youth, is the behavior and attitudes of
peers, the positive attitudes and actions of Skill Leaders expose
students in I-STAR classes to positive peer pressure.
<P>
Evaluation of Projects I-STAR and STAR has been extensive, and
is funded by a multi-million dollar federal research grant.
<P>
Project I-STAR currently is being conducted in 93 schools in the
Indianapolis metropolitan area. Every public and private school
in Marion County and most parochial schools offer I-STAR as part
of a drug-education curriculum. I-STAR also is operating in several
schools in counties surrounding Indianapolis and is available
to any school in Indiana. For more information, contact Project
I-STAR at 5559 W. 73rd St., Indianapolis, IN 46268.
<P>
<B>D.A.R.E., </B>which also evolved from Project SMART, traces
much of its success to the use of uniformed law-enforcement officers
in the classroom. The D.A.R.E. curriculum is taught by veteran
officers who have completed 80 hours of intensive training. The
officers are assisted by classroom teachers, who remain in the
classroom and help with activities.
<P>
The program's curriculum and training resulted from a cooperative
effort of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles
Unified School District. The program now has spread across the
United States and currently has five regional training sites.
It is expected that more sites will be established over the next
few years. In Indiana, 50 law-enforcement agencies currently provide
D.A.R.E. programs.
<P>
The D.A.R.E. curriculum is targeted to the fifth and/or sixth
graders who will enter junior high the following year and includes
17 45- to 50-minute lessons, which are highly structured and build
upon one another. Lesson topics include &quot;Practices for Personal
Safety,&quot; &quot;Resistance Techniques,&quot; &quot;Building
Self-Esteem,&quot; &quot;Media Influences,&quot; &quot;Role Modeling&quot;
and &quot;Ways to Deal with Pressures from Gangs.&quot;
<P>
Lessons in the D.A.R.E. program are designed to teach students
the social skills necessary to recognize and resist influences
and other pressures experienced when making personal choices.
While building refusal skills is integral to the program, developing
self-esteem, decision-making skills, critical thinking and communication
skills also are emphasized.
<P>
The same officer conducts all D.A.R.E. sessions in a particular
class. In addition to the time spent with the class during lesson
time, the officer also spends time with students during lunch
and recess. This way, the officer is able to relate to students
in a non-threatening situation, and when students see the officer
outside school they are able to relate to him or her as a respected
authority figure they know personally, not just as another person
enforcing rules.
<P>
D.A.R.E. ends with a schoolwide assembly in which all students
participating in the program receive a certificate of completion.
<P>
Program activities include the use of student leaders from area
high schools. These students, who do not use drugs, have been
identified by teachers and fellow students as being admired and
respected. The high-school students serve as role models for students
in the D.A.R.E. program.
<P>
An advisory group has been formed in Indiana to examine the how
best to coordinate D.A.R.E. throughout the state. Representatives
from local, county and state law-enforcement agencies, education
and business are included in the group. For more information about
starting a D.A.R.E. program, contact local law-enforcement agencies.
<P>
The 4th Indiana Prevention Conference - &quot;STRONG FENCES: Building
Resilience in Youth and Communities&quot; - will feature workshop
sessions about both programs.

<P>
Cigarette smoke contains hundreds of harmful chemicals, but none
of them cause smokers to try other drugs. It isn't the chemicals
that make tobacco a &quot;gateway drug,&quot; it's worse!
<P>
Gateway drugs are drugs that serve as almost essential precursors
to use of other drugs, such as marijuana, heroin and cocaine.
In other words, use of gateway drugs serves as the &quot;gate&quot;
or path that almost always precedes the use of the other drugs
and leads to the drug-using lifestyle. Heroin addicts rarely,
if ever, start out using heroin - they start with gateway drugs
and then move on to the heroin.
<P>
But the link between the gateway drug and the other drug is not
biochemical. The gateway drugs serve as social and psychological
precursors to the use of other drugs. The decisions to use the
tobacco or other gateway drugs set up <B>patterns of behavior</B>
that make it easier for a user to go on to the other drugs. It
is the series of decisions made by the smoker that make decisions
to use other drugs easier. Social psychologists refer to this
phenomenon as a &quot;developmental progression.&quot; Students
who decide to accept the risks of smoking later find it much easier
to accept the risks of using other drugs.
<P>
On the other hand, students who make conscious decisions to avoid
smoking tobacco because of the health risks are very unlikely
to make a decision to smoke marijuana, because accepting the health
risks of marijuana smoking would be psychologically inconsistent.
<P>
While the link is not biochemical, it is powerful nonetheless.
How powerful is the influence of a gateway drug? In 1987, a research
team at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research
found that among high-school seniors, daily cigarette smokers
were <B>10 times more likely to use cocaine</B> regularly than
were seniors who never had smoked regularly! Students who never
smoked were much less likely to experiment with controlled substances
and very unlikely to use them regularly. Nearly one-fourth of
the seniors who smoked cigarettes daily had used cocaine in the
month before the survey! (Johnston, <U>et al.</U>, 1987)
<P>
The Michigan study examined five different levels of smoking history
and use of 15 different drugs. The evidence was overwhelming that
cigarette-smoking high-school seniors were much more likely to
use controlled substances (but only slightly more likely to use
alcohol) than were non-smoking students.
<P>
The link is dose-related - the more cigarettes a student smoked,
the more likely he or she was to use marijuana and cocaine. For
example, while less than 4 percent of the high-school seniors
who never had smoked tried cocaine one or more times during their
senior year of high school, more than 40 percent of the seniors
who smoked a pack a day or more had tried cocaine during the year.
Only 7.2 percent of non-smoking seniors used marijuana during
the month before the survey, as compared with 59 percent of the
pack-a-day smokers. (More detailed data is provided in the charts
that accompany this article.)
<P>
Unlike in the 1960s and 1970s, when older teens and adults sometimes
took up smoking, virtually all new smokers in the 1990s begin
experimenting with tobacco in the late elementary grades and progressively
acquire the addiction before age 16. It has been suggested that
if a child doesn't experiment with tobacco before age 13, he or
she is unlikely ever to try it.
<P>
According to U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis
Sullivan, the tobacco industry must gain 5,000 new smokers every
day just to maintain a level number of customers, because about
1,300 of its best customers die each day from smoking, another
200 die from other causes, and about 3,500 smokers quit. Because
the only &quot;new&quot; smokers are children, the industry must
entice at least 5,000 additional pre-teens to try its product
every single day.
<P>
If the only risk to these pre-teens was addiction to tobacco and
the resulting health consequences, that would be bad enough. But
if one-half of those kids go on to try cocaine -- and one-third
will use illegal drugs every month by the time they are seniors
in high school -- the results of that enticement are even more
unconscionable.
<P>
Prevention of controlled substance use begins with prevention
of tobacco and other gateway drug use.
<P>
If we hope to reduce the use of marijuana and cocaine in the next
decade's high- school students, we must reduce the use of tobacco
in this decade's elementary-school students. A tobacco-free lifestyle
serves as a powerful protective factor against abuse of controlled
substances.
<P>
It is essential that today's elementary-school students learn
the risks of tobacco use and skills for avoiding the peer and
social pressures that encourage them to experiment.

<HR>
<P><B>The relationship between a person's consumption of alcohol and subsequent disinhibition of sexual behavior is strong, although not well understood.  Studies have found that for men, the mere expectancy that drinking has occurred can enhance arousal and disinhibition.</B></P>
<HR>

<P>In settings ranging from candlelight dinners to drunken debaucheries, alcohol has been depicted as a solvent of sexual inhibitions.  Studies of beliefs and experiences have attested to the pervasiveness of the view that alcohol provokes and heightens sexual responsiveness (Athanasiou et al. 1970; Brown et al. 1980).  Yet the relationship between drinking and sexuality is far more complex than that defined by this simple formula:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>Alcohol input  ---&#62;  sexual output.</B></CENTER>
<P>And this complexity is found in the relationship between alcohol consumption and sexual responsiveness to both deviant and nondeviant sexual materials.</P>

<P>The relationship between alcohol consumption and responses to deviant erotica is of particular interest and is the main topic of this article.  Much research has demonstrated an association between the reading or viewing of violent pornography and rape-supportive attitudes and behaviors in normal males (Malamuth and Donnerstein 1984).  However, controversy surrounds this issue because the exact nature of the relationship has not been established.  The connection between alcohol and deviant sexual material may be important because of alcohol's strong link to sexual responding.</P>

<HR>
<H3> ALCOHOL AND SEXUAL AROUSAL</H3>

<P>The relationship between alcohol and sex is complex in part because the individual's responses to alcohol and to sexual stimuli involve complex psychological and physiological processes.  Alcohol seems to have the paradoxical effects of enhancing and suppressing sexual responses, with the two effects reflecting the two processes.</P>

<P>There is an inverse relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and the level of physical sexual arousal; that is, as the concentration of alcohol in the blood increases, sexual arousal diminishes.  Several studies have shown that penile response decreases with increases in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in a linear fashion (Briddell and Wilson 1976; Farkas and Rosen 1976).  Also, the time required for men to achieve orgasm during masturbation increases as BAC increases (Malatesta et al. 1979).  Exceptions to the pattern of suppression of penile response have been observed at low BACs. </P>

<P>With women, a similar pattern emerges: increases in BAC have been associated with diminishing vaginal arousal (Wilson and Lawson 1978) and increases in the time required to attain orgasm (Malatesta et al. 1982).  That acute alcohol consumption suppresses the physical sexual response of both men and women is the clearest and most robust finding in alcohol-sex research.</P>

<P>On the other hand, subjective sexual arousal is affected not only by blood alcohol concentration but also by a person's beliefs about the effects of alcohol.  That is, expectancies about the relationship between alcohol and sex generated by the culture influence how a person believes he or she will respond to sexual stimuli.</P>

<P>A methodological technique known as the balanced placebo design (BPD) has been helpful in elucidating the psychology of drinking.  The BPD compares the independent and interactive influences of alcohol's physiological and psychological effects.  The technique manipulates two factors in drinking:  perceived alcohol content, which is known as the expectancy set, and actual alcohol content.  Participants in BPD studies are led to expect that they will be given either alcoholic or nonalcoholic drinks;  then within those two groups, half again either receive alcohol or do not (Figure 1).  Thus, the BPD creates four groups:  subjects who expect alcohol and receive alcohol, subjects who expect alcohol and do not receive it, subjects who do not expect alcohol and who do not receive it, and subjects who do not expect alcohol yet do receive it.  An important shortcoming of the BPD is that it necessarily limits the alcohol dosage to relatively low levels.  Despite this and other shortcomings, BPD studies have divulged much about alcohol's effects on men (Knight et al. 1986; Collins and Searles 1988).</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="graph1.gif">
<H5>Figure 1<BR>
In experiments involving the balanced placebo design, four<BR>different groups of subjects are tested.  This allows researchers<BR>to judge the effects of expectancies about alcohol in addition<BR>to actual effects of alcohol.</BLOCKQUOTE></H5>

<P>In these studies, the men expecting to receive alcohol -- irrespective of whether or not they did receive it -- have exhibited greater penile responses (Wilson and Lawson 1976; Briddell et al. 1978) and subjective arousal (Lang et al. 1980; George and Marlatt 1986).  Men who expect alcohol also have chosen to spend more time watching erotic slides (George and Marlatt 1986) 0and waiting to be shown erotic films (Abrams and Wilson 1983).  In one study, the expectancy set increased the length of time subjects chose to view erotica, but only for subjects who had a high degree of guilt about sex (Lang et al. 1980).  Such enhancements of sexual responsiveness based on the expectancy set have not been duplicated in studies employing erotic materials with low arousal potential (McCarty et al, 1982) and studies in which exposure to erotica was accompanied by competing processes such as divided attention tasks or instruction that counter arousal (Lansky and Wilson 1981; Wilson and Niaura 1984; Wilson et al. 1985).  In sum, the expectation that one has consumed low dosages of alcohol has been found to enhance, in men, penile tumescence, subjective arousal, and the tendency to read or view pornography.</P>

<P>BPD studies of women have been less revealing.  Only a few studies have employed female subjects, and these have produced confusing results.  Wilson and Lawson (1978) found that the expectancy set did not affect vaginal arousal, while alcohol content reduced arousal.  However, subjective arousal in women did correlate positively with the level of intoxication.  Although both women and men are known to expect that alcohol heightens sexual response, women's responses in BPD studies have borne this out less well than have men's responses.</P>

<P>One explanation for the difference in the responses of the genders has been suggested by studies of social anxiety.  These BPD studies involve cross-gender social processes that have an indirect bearing on the link between alcohol and sexuality.  To induce anxiety in subjects, researchers tell them that they will have to impress judges of the opposite sex who will evaluate their attractiveness.  Under such conditions, the alcohol expectancy set reduced anxiety (Wilson and Abrams 1977) and increased self-disclosure (Caudill et al. 1987) in men, but had opposite effects on women (Abrams and Wilson 1979; Caudill et al. 1987).  Exit interviews revealed that women who expected to receive alcohol worried that men might misinterpret their actions.  This concern agrees with the timeless warning for women to exercise more care when drinking with men so as to guard against undesired sexual advances.  It would have made them more anxious and less self-disclosing.  An implication of this interpretation is that men and women differ in their sexual responses to the alcohol expectancy set partly because they experience different degrees of inhibition (Lang 1985; Crowe and George 1989).  In addition to inhibitory concerns that might weigh against a drinking man's sexual expression (for example, sexually transmitted diseases),  concerns such as contraception, social stigmatization, and sexual and nonsexual victimization exist for a drinking woman (Fillmore 1985; also see the article by Blume, pp. 139-146).  Thus, the alcohol expectancy set should create less sexual enhancement for women than for men.</P>

<P>Men's responses in BPD studies have agreed with the belief that alcohol enhances sexual behavior.  And the responses seem consistent with the idea that men have learned to view men and women drinking together as a potential sexual situation in which men have an exploitable advantage.  Women's behavior in BPD studies suggests, on the surface, that they have learned to view men and women drinking together as a potentially disadvantageous situation, that is, as a possible prelude to undesired sexual advances.</P>

<P>To summarize, alcohol has been found to have paradoxical effects on sexual arousal.  Increasing doses of alcohol suppress physiological signs of arousal for both men and women.  On the other hand, the alcohol expectancy set enhances physical and subjective signs of arousal in men but not in women.  Therefore, culturally transmitted beliefs and expectations can exert a powerful influence over sexuality in drinking situations.  These cultural processes become more important with respect to disinhibition of deviant sexual behavior.<P>

<HR>
<H3>DISINHIBITION AND DEVIANT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR</H3>

<P>Does alcohol disinhibit deviant sexual behavior?  Gossip, crime and news stories, and fictional accounts would indicate that an affirmative answer to this question is a foregone conclusion.  Scientific research has yielded ambiguous conclusions.</P>

<P>Even the definitions of deviance and disinhibition are unclear.  Obviously, that which is judged to be deviant varies across cultures.  Similarly, disinhibition is interpreted differently in different cultures.  Inhibitions typically are considered standards for acceptable behavior which are transmitted by the culture and internalized by the individual.  Because the adequacy of such transmission and internalization is never known precisely and because the mechanics of disinhibition are not visible, the judgment that disinhibition has occurred requires a fair degree of inference and subjectivity.  The grayness of such judgments, coupled with expectations about alcohol's powers, yields a wide berth for blaming sexual misbehaviors on alcohol rather than the person.  It is accordingly not surprising that perpetrators of illegal sexual acts such as rape and incest later blame alcohol (Scully and Marolla 1984; Williams and Finkelhor 1990).</P>

<P>Cultural processes shape the definitions of deviance, the inhibitions that alcohol presumably loosens, and the judgements that disinhibition has occurred.  In a blow to the intuitive wisdom that alcohol disinhibits deviant behavior solely by virtue of its drug action, MacAndrew and Edgerton (1969) argued that alcohol's effects across and within cultures are too variable to be completely explained by pharmacology.  Likewise, there is high variability across and within individuals.  Therefore, any general rule or theory attempting to link alcohol with deviance must also assign importance to situational and predispositional factors as well as cultural factors.  The cumulative weight of these factors is significant and will forever argue against any simplistic alcohol-causes-deviance assertion.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, careful experimentation has been applied to investigating the role of alcohol in the disinhibition of deviant sexual behavior in men.  In one of the aforementioned BPD studies, it was found that heterosexual men who expected to receive alcohol became more aroused by films of explicit heterosexual activity than did men who expected no alcohol (Wilson and Lawson 1976).  This study also found that the expectancy-set effect occurred and was even more pronounced when the subjects were shown films of homosexual activities.  Although there is no inherent deviance in homosexual activity, genital arousal in heterosexual men shown portrayals of homosexual activity might be construed as out of character.  The results led the researchers to speculate that the expectancy set provided subjects with an excuse for sexual arousal that might otherwise be judged unacceptable by the self and by others.  This apparent exploitation of alcohol's excuse value under laboratory conditions agrees with excuse seeking by sexual deviates such as rapists (Scully and Marolla 1984).</P>

<P>Briddell and co-workers (1978) performed a study in which subjects listened to audiotapes depiciting consenting heterosexual intercourse and forcible rape.  Despite some shortcomings (Barbaree 1990), the study revealed that the alcohol expectancy set increased penile responses.  The effect was more pronounced during exposure to depicitions of rape than during exposure to depicitions of intercourse.  Presumably, the deviant nature of the rape created a greater need for alcohol's excuse-conferring properties.</P>

<P>Because deviance is in the eye of the beholder, the alcohol excuse should also have greater utility for some people than for others.  Lang and co-workers (1980) investigated whether men who are more inclined to feel guilty about sexuality would be affected more by the alcohol expectancy set than would others.  The researchers instructed subjects in the use of a slide projector and then allowed the subjects to watch and rate a series of erotic slides on their own.  Unbeknown to the subjects, the slide exposure times were measured and considered as a behavioral index of the subjects' interest in erotica.  The alcohol expectancy set was found to have no effect on subjects with low or moderate guilt about sexuality.  However, among subjects with high degrees of guilt about sexuality, the men with the expectancy set viewed erotic longer than did the men who did not expect alcohol.  This effect of the expectancy set with high-guilt men became more pronounced as the pornographic content of the slides increased.  Because the level of sex guilt or inhibition was determined prior to the experiment, this study provides the best evidence for a process of disinhibition.  And again, the disinhibitory agent was the alcohol expectancy set, not alcohol.</P>

<P>In a study in which subjects were not preselected based on guilt about sexuality, George and Marlatt (1986) measured interest in viewing violence, erotic, and violent erotica.  Men expecting to receive alcohol chose to view more of the material than did men not expecting alcohol.  Again, this expectancy-set effect became more pronounced with the viewing of more deviant erotica.  Also, for men shown slides of violent erotica, the expectancy-set effect was greatest with the most deviant subset of those slides.</P>

<P>In a recent extension of this work, men were allowed to view erotica at the same time that an unseen and unknown partner viewed it (George et al. 1990).  The subject and partner were both served drinks that ostensibly could contain alcohol, although no alcohol was actually served.  Under these conditions, the expectancy set about the partner's drinking was most influential in determining the subject's behavior.  Subjects spent more time viewing erotica when they thought the other person had consumed alcohol.  Moreover, this expectancy-set effect concerning the other person increased as the explicitness and deviance of the viewed material increased.  That is, the difference between the amount of erotica viewed with drinking versus with nondrinking partners widened with more deviant erotica.</P>

<P>These experiments convey a distinct impression:  men behave as though alcohol excuses deviant sexual indulgence.  Futhermore, the use of alcohol as an alibi becomes more apparent when the usefulness of the alcohol excuse is heightened either by virtue of the person's standards or by virtue of the deviance of the indulgence.  Not all studies have fit these patterns (Barbaree et al. 1983); nevertheless, the consistency in the five studies mentioned here is striking when considered alongside the ambiguity inherent in the area of alcohol, disinhibition, and deviance.</P>

<HR>
<H3>DISCUSSION</H3>

<P>Again, does alcohol disinhibit deviant sexual behavior?  Research based on the balanced placebo design suggests that there is a relationship between learned associations about alcohol's effects and disinhibition of deviant and nondeviant sexual behavior in men.  However, this relationship is so fraught with complexities and qualifying circumstances that it is difficult to decipher its true nature.  Is it causal, correlational, or coincidental?  That is, does alcohol cause disinhibition to occur or does it just look that way because (a) people who engage in deviant sex drink more in general, (b) deviance and drinking are both caused by a third variable such as a personality or dispositional factor, or (c) both are caused by social (for example, permissiveness) or environmental features common to the settings where drinking and deviance occur?  Perhaps some combination of these scenarios exists. </P>

<P>Within the smaller scope of data from experiments in which it is assumed that a casual relationship exists, information has been gained.  At low dosages of alcohol, the belief that alcohol has been consumed promotes indulgence in deviant sexual behavior for men.  According to a number of researchers, this effect seems due to a "discriminative disengagement of self-evaluative processes"  (Marlatt and Rohsenow 1980; Wilson 1981; Lang 1985; Hull and Bond 1986; Crowe and George 1989).  Men behave as though they have an internal censor that normally guards against deviant sexual expression.  Consequently, this censorship becomes muted when men are convinced that they have been drinking.</P>

<P>This alcohol-as-excuse explanation of a casual link between alcohol and deviant sexual behavior has intuitive appeal, but is not fully satisfying for several reasons.  First, it is based on data from only male subjects.  This is partly defensible  because men are most often the perpetrators of sex crimes.  However, from a scientific perspective, overreliance on male data restricts and potentially distorts construction of a theory.</P>

<P>Second, the best support is from BPD data, in which the alcohol dosage is restricted to low levels.  Events such as sex crimes, which involve using alcohol as an excuse, typically also involve greater consumption of alcohol.  An explanation of disinhibition that does not incorporate the full range of alcohol dosages is therefore incomplete.</P>

<P>Third, the excuse explanation rests on some underlying assumptions that have not been confirmed.  It assumes that men consider alcohol consumption to be a viable excuse for deviant sexual indulgence, and that once drinking commences, this expectancy influences their behavior.  While questionnaires have established that people generally believe alcohol enhances or disinhibits sexuality (Brown et al. 1980), studies have not established that people endorse alcohol's excuse-conferring properties.  In addition, there is only modest support for the idea that a previously held expectancy about alcohol can affect behavior after drinking (George et al. 1989).</P>

<P>Finally, the excuse explanation implies that there exists a motivation to drink prior to an opportunity to indulge in deviant sexual behavior.  In such circumstances, a person wishing to indulge will drink in order to excuse later disinhibition.  Anecdotal reports support this idea.  However, when tested experimentally, this hypothesis has received modest support or no support (George et al. 1988; Skinner and George 1988 <I>a,b;</I> Skinner unpublished data 1991).</P>

<HR>
<H3>ALCOHOL MYOPIA</H3>

<P>In an alternative explanation of alcohol's contribution to disinhibition, Steele and colleagues emphasize the importance of alcohol's physiological effects (Steele and Southwick 1985; Steele and Josephs 1990).  Their theory is based on evidence that alcohol impairs attention, cognition, and information processing.  It proposes that a person is more likely to exhibit a socially "excessive" behavior when intoxicated, if the behavior ordinarily is one that presents a conflict.  By decreasing the person's ability to process information, alcohol eliminates the conflict the person would experience related to the behavior.  This is referred to as alcohol myopia, and, supposedly, greater intoxication leads to greater myopia which leads to greater disinhibition.  A clear advantage of this alcohol-myopia explanation is that it extends to situations involving higher dosages of alcohol -- the most problematic episodes of alcohol-related disinhibition involve high dosages.</P>

<P>Combining the alcohol-myopia model with the excuse explanation may yield a more satisfying account of sexual disinhibition following drinking.  It is conveivable that when alcohol is consumed in low dosages, a person exploits the alcohol excuse to lead to sexual disinhibition.  When alcohol is consumed in higher dosages (although not so high as to suppress sexual arousal completely), alcohol myopia becomes alcohol's main contribution to sexual disinhibition.</P>

<HR>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3>

<P>Alcohol and sexuality are closely linked in this culture.  A casual description of this link is that alcohol has powerful aphrodisiac properties that can be used wittingly or unwittingly to encourage the reluctant mate or to unleash deviant sexual desires.  Studies have revealed that the relationship between alcohol and sexuality is very complex.  Alcohol can influence the expression of deviant and nondeviant sexual behavior; however, this influence is shaped by numerous qualifying conditions, such as dosage, gender, and expectancy.</P>

<H3>From the Director of CSAP...</H3>
<B>
<P>It is commonly believed that factors such as stigma, denial, alienation, discrimination, and the cultural importance of bars place lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals at higher risk of developing problems with alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD).  Although we need much more research before we can substantiate this belief, we do know one thing:  many issues need to be understood and addressed by prevention professionals working with lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities before they can deal with the destructive consequences of ATOD.</P>
<P>I hope this prevention resource guide increases your understanding of the issues important to the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.  The guide is the product of a search of the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information data bases.  It describes articles and reports from peer-reviewed journals and books, lists materials with clear ATOD prevention messages, and gives resources for more information.</P>
Alcohol, tobacco, and other drug problems affect the lives of millions of Americans.  We at CSAP welcome this opportunity to work with you toward a healthier future for our lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.

<B>Violence Toward Homosexuals:  Experts Recommend Research on Consequences of <BR>
<I>Sargent, M. </I></B><BR>
<I>ADAMHA News </I>August 1989, pp. 9-10
<BLOCKQUOTE>Homosexuals who are victims of violence are said to suffer from &quotPost Traumatic Stress Disorder Plus&quot (PTSD+).  The disorder is manifested by symptoms, such as an inability to concentrate, loss of trust in others, startle reactions, depression, anxiety, nightmares, and eating and sleeping problems.  Homosexuals who have been victims of violence appear to be at a high risk for alcoholism, drug abuse, and suicide -- all ways to escape pain.  Recommendations include studies to decide the prevalence of anti-homosexual violence, its risk factors, the types of mental health consequences experienced by victims, their coping skills, and services needs.  Studies are suggested also on the training needs and characteristics of service providers in the mental health and criminal justice fields.  Preventive efforts, such as educational programs for potential perpetrators of violence, including teenagers and family members, are recommended also.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Stress, Expectancies, and Vulnerability to Substance Abuse:  Test of a Model among Homosexual Men<BR>
<I>McKirnan, D.J., and Peterson, P.L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Abnormal Psychology </I>97(4):461-466, 1988<BR>
(Available from David J. McKirnan, Department of Psychology m/c 285, Box 4348, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60680.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Researchers hypothesize that specific attitudes or expectancies make people vulnerable to responding to stress with alcohol or other drugs.  This &quotstress-vulnerability&quot model was tested among homosexual men who show elevated rates of substance abuse and have culturally specific stressors and vulnerability.  Tension reduction expectancies of alcohol effects had a substantial effect on alcohol and marijuana/drug abuse, as did the use of bars as a social resource.  Two stress variables -- negative affectivity and discrimination attributable to sexual orientation -- also had significant, though more moderate effects.  Interactions of the vulnerability measures with the stress variables had significant effects on substance abuse beyond the main effects, supporting the central hypothesis.  In a second analysis both simple consumption levels and high-risk styles of alcohol or other drug use predicted alcohol or other drug problems better among vulnerable than among nonvulnerable respondents.  These findings strongly supported a general stress-vulnerability model of substance abuse and illustrated several important risk factors in homosexual culture.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Data Missing for in-the-Closet Gay Drinkers<BR>
<I>Zimmerman, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>U.S. Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence </I>June 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author suggests that the widely quoted statistic that 30 to 35 percent of the gay population has alcohol or other drug problems may be understated because it is based on evidence from people who have acknowledged their homosexuality.  Research subjects are suggested to get a better understanding of the true epidemiology of this problem and, in turn, provide the necessary data for more appropriate, effective prevention and treatment strategies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Chemical Dependency in Gay and Lesbian Youth</B><BR>
<I>Shifrin, F., and Solis, M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Chemical Dependency Treatment </I>5(1):67-76, 1992<BR>
(Available from Haworth Press, 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Issues underlying chemical use by gay youths are outlined.  These include:  decreasing the stigma felt in developing a homosexual or gay identity by medicating the concomitant anxiety; helping discharge sexual impulses more comfortably; decreasing depression and dissonance generated by the adolescent's discovery of his or her sexual identity; escaping the pain of exclusion, ridicule, and rejection of the family and peer group; gaining a sense of power; and gaining a sense of identity.  A discussion of treatment issues includes:  prevention; gay youth in a straight treatment setting; the role of the family in treatment; and other factors, such as denial and family pathologies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Double Trouble:  Lesbians Emerging from Alcoholic Families <BR>
<I>Rothberg, B.P., and Kidder, D.M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Chemical Dependency Treatment </I>5(1):77-92, 1992<BR>
(Available from Haworth Press, 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904-1580.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>A young woman emerging as a lesbian in an alcoholic family system faces a dual set of problems.  She knows the life and shame of being an adult child of an alcoholic (ACOA), while she has all the stresses all lesbians face in a society that renders them deviant and invisible.  The process of identity formation is inexorably linked with growing up in a shame-based family system where there is already a high level of stress and intolerance for upsetting the balance at any time.  Successful relationships depend on the development of intimacy, which depends on each individual's ability to share and reveal the true self or the deep, emotional self.  Ideally, the formation of a couple's relationship should be the result of a process of emotional bonding accompanied by a healthy dose of self-individuation.  A beginning relationship for an emerging lesbian can be fraught with anxiety producing stimuli.  Once developed, however, a relationship with another woman can provide the possibilities of growth for an ACOA lesbian by providing her with an atmosphere of nurturance, support, and validation.  Conversely, a relationship initiated by fear, alienation, and loneliness, or by the desire to escape family of origin, can become a stumbling block to development.  Stages of therapeutic intervention for the lesbian ACOA are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Lesbians' and Gay Men's Experiences of Discrimination and Harassment in a University Community<BR>
<I>D'Augelli, A.P.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Community Psychology </I>17(3):317-321, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>A survey of 125 lesbians and gay men in a university community was conducted to determine the incidence of discrimination, harassment, and violence.  Nearly three-fourths had experienced verbal abuse; 26 percent were threatened with violence; and 17 percent had personal property damaged.  Students and roommates were most often responsible.  Most incidents were not reported to authorities, and many made changes in their daily routines to avoid harm.  Over half of the sample feared for their personal safety; their fear was related to the amount of harassment and previous property damage.  Men were more often victimized than women.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Since initial reports emerged of an association between recreational drug use and high-risk sexual behaviors in gay men, there has been interest in studying this relationship for its relevance to behavioral interventions. This study reports the longitudinal patterns of alcohol and other drug use of gay men in the Chicago Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) Coping and Change Study (CCS).  A pattern of decreasing drug use over 6 years was observed that paralleled a decline in high-risk sexual behavior (i.e., unprotected anal intercourse).  In contrast, alcohol consumption tended to be more stable over time and to show no relationship to sexual behavior change.  Men who combined volatile nitrite (popper) use with other recreational drugs were at high risk both behaviorally and in terms of immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) seroconversion throughout the study.  Popper use also was associated independently with lapse from safer sexual behaviors (failure to use a condom during receptive anal sex).  Use of other recreational substances showed no relationship to sexual behavior change patterns, and stopping use was unrelated to improvement in safer sexual behavior.  When popper use and lapse from safer sex were reanalyzed, controlling for primary relationship status, popper use was associated with failure to use condoms during receptive anal sex among nonmonogamous men only.  These findings suggest an association between popper use and high-risk sexual behavior among members of the Chicago MACS/CCS cohort that has relevance to HIV prevention intervention efforts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To learn how gay men of AA use spirituality in everyday life, 50 gay American men were interviewed in depth.  The findings of this study are presented here so that clinicians can teach their gay male clients how other gay men recovering from chemical dependency go about practicing spirituality.  In everyday life, the men in this study practiced spirituality by maintaining sobriety, ridding themselves of internalized homophobia, communicating with their Higher Power (who was defined as God by the overwhelming majority of the study's participants), turning their lives and wills over to the care of God as they understood Him, performing good works (both corporal and spiritual works of mercy), meeting adult social roles, engaging in self-examination, applying AA slogans to everyday life, sharing themselves with others, attending AA meetings, seeking forgiveness, reading positive gay, alcoholic, and other literature, engaging in rituals, engaging in sacrifice and discipline, and doing everyday tasks as well as they possibly could.  Tips on how clinicians may use this knowledge for their gay male clients are provided.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is growing awareness in the lesbian community about the prevalence of alcohol problems and the meanings and values attached to alcohol use are currently undergoing change.  Little research has focused on lesbians' life experiences and alcohol use practices, although in earlier decades a number of medical theories linked lesbianism with alcohol problems as copathologies.  More recent theories from the social sciences also linked lesbianism with alcohol problems, but on the basis of sociocultural dynamics and consequent negative self-images.  This article compares and contrasts medical theories about lesbians and alcohol, with lesbians' own ideas about alcohol use and alcohol problems.  Mutually reinforcing themes in medical views and lesbians' experiences are identified.  The analysis clarifies what is at stake in the current debates about alcohol, alcohol problems, and recovery experiences in the lesbian community, and offers suggestions for research, theory, and practice regarding this significant health issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Complex societies, such as those in Canada, include people from a variety of special populations.  It has been observed that drinking problems within these subpopulations tend to be specific to such groups.  Identification of the special problems of subpopulations is seen as important in intervention issues.  The Task Group on Homosexuality, established by the American Sociological Association, found that the stigma associated with homosexuality discouraged researchers from studying this group.  Thus, a questionnaire was designed to reflect the controversies in the literature concerning homosexuals and their alcohol use to find out what is known and thought by alcohol intervention workers.  Questionnaires were mailed to respondents who filled them out anonymously.  Three follow ups were used to ensure a solid response rate.  The age of respondents ranged from 25 to 63 years, with a median age of 40 years.  Education, occupation, partner status, and size of workplace are listed in tabular form.  Respondents generally felt that heavy drinking is more prevalent in the gay community than in the general population, and that intervention efforts should take sexual orientation into account.  They also believed that intervention protocol does not encourage gays to seek treatment.  Results indicate an overall lack of knowledge about lesbian-male gay differences.  It is concluded that Ontario agencies and any other agencies dealing with alcohol problems need to decide whether their programs are relevant or can benefit homosexuals.  42 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcoholism and Non-Acceptance of Gay Self:  The Critical Link<BR>
<I>Kus, R.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Homosexuality </I>15(1-2):25-41, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Research was conducted to investigate the etiology of alcoholism among gay American men and to explore any relationship between etiology and gay bars or nonacceptance of gay self or both.  The study was part of a larger project aimed at generating grounded theory on the nature of sobriety among gay people.  Twenty gay men recovering from alcoholism were interviewed in depth in Seattle, Iowa City, Chicago, and Oklahoma City; each of the men had been sober at least 1 year.  The following conclusions were made from the results:  (1) the disease etiology of the informants was totally unrelated to gay bars, but most of the men thought the gay bar ethnotheory could explain the high incidence of alcoholism in the gay community; (2) before they were sober, none of the men viewed being gay as a positive thing, yet many did not realize until they were sober that they were nonaccepting; (3) only after choosing and living sobriety did the men accept being gay as a positive aspect of self; and (4) the etiology and high incidence of alcoholism among American gay men may be explained by nonacceptance of being gay as a positive aspect.  14 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Homosexual men and women may be at risk for alcohol and other drug abuse due to psychosocial variables, such as drinking styles, stress, or the cultural importance of bars.  The study of psychosocial variables in homosexual culture may help us understand how they operate generally.  This paper describes the findings of a large (n=3,400) survey of homosexual population.  The core hypothesis was that stress and other psychosocial variables have their primary effects among people made vulnerable to substance abuse by individual expectancies and/or cultural values.  Tension reduction expectancies of alcohol effects had substantial effects on alcohol and other drug abuse, as did the use of bars as a social resource, a vulnerability variable more specific to urban homosexual culture.  Further, stress affected alcohol and other drug problems only among people who were vulnerable via expectancies and values.  Both high-risk styles of substance use and simple consumption levels had much stronger effects on problems among vulnerable respondents, thus supporting the stress-vulnerability perspective.  Individual differences in social role status were related to alcohol and other drug problems and may explain differences between homosexual and general populations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from EMT Group, Inc., 3090 Fite Circle, Suite 201, Sacramento, CA 95827.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper presents findings from the Trilogy Project, a study on alcohol and other drug use among gay men and lesbians in two metropolitan communities in a southern State.  The study investigated social issues, such as victimization, discrimination, stress, social support, AIDS testing, sexual practices, and psychological well-being.  It focused on the epidemiology and etiology of licit and illicit drug use.  The goals of the Trilogy Project were to (1) examine the prevalence and frequency of using 11 licit and illicit drugs by a large sample of self-defined gay men and lesbians; (2) compare the prevalence rates of AOD use of gay men and lesbians to that of respondents from the 1988 National Household Survey on Drug Use; and (3) examine the etiology of substance use among gay men and lesbians by elaborating, refining, and testing causal models derived from the literature on stress, social supports, and personal well-being.  This paper contains data for goals (1) and (2).  The study concluded that the prevalence of problematic alcohol use among gay men and lesbians is not higher than that occurring in the general population.  Programs must be specially designed to meet the needs of the lesbian and gay population.  These programs need to recognize both the differences and similarities between gay and lesbian substance abusers and their nongay/lesbian counterparts.  The author contends that the gay and lesbian communities are interested in learning more about themselves, and that researchers and practitioners need to design studies, programs, and policies that make their participation nonthreatening, safe, and worthwhile.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>An Exploration of Lesbians Images of Recovery from Alcohol Problems<BR>

Proceedings, The Research Symposium on Alcohol and Other Drug Problem Prevention among Lesbians and Gay Men, October 1992<BR>
(Available from EMT Group, Inc., 3090 Fite Circle, Suite 201, Sacramento, CA 95827.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author explores the images lesbians used to describe their recovery from alcohol problems and the implications for health care.  Lesbians' experiences in recovery are particularly significant because of growing concerns about the prevalence of alcohol problems among lesbians, the vulnerability of lesbians as an aggregate, and the cultural trend away from substance use in lesbian communities.  Images of recovery are the descriptions that people offer about their healing from alcohol problems.  They are the framework by which problem drinkers interpret the meanings of their experiences and determine which aspects of their lives are most pertinent to their recovery efforts.  The images persons use to represent their progress and the difficulties they encounter in recovery also provide important bases for developing relevant resources, therapeutic techniques, and social support.  Excerpts from an ongoing ethnographic interview study about the recovery experiences of lesbians with alcohol problems illustrate the diversity of recovery images characteristic of this population. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The San Francisco Men's Health Study (SFMHS) is a longitudinal study of gay and bisexual men selected through a random household sampling technique of the 19 census tracts in San Francisco with the highest cumulative incidence of AIDS as of 1984.  Follow-up of the HIV seropositive men allows ascertainment of the long-term effects of HIV infection within a cohort of gay men.  Measures of drug and alcohol use were included at baseline and were repeated throughout the course of the study.  The findings presented in this paper show substantial declines for the prevalence of marijuana, cocaine, LSD, downers, opiates, uppers, and any drug use during the course of the 1980s.  The authors also note increases in abstention over time, as well as declines in heavy/frequent use.  These declines over time were for both HIV positives and negatives, although the positives tended to report higher levels of AOD use on intake.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Homosexual men and women have been described as being at high risk for alcohol and other drug abuse due to psychosocial variables, such as stress levels or the cultural importance of bar settings.  However, there are few actual data in this regard.  This paper presents the finding of a large (n=3,400) survey of a homosexual population regarding population characteristics and patterns of alcohol and other drug use.  Psychosocial variables that may account for substance use patterns both generally and in this population are discussed in an accompanying paper.  Substantially higher proportions of the homosexual sample used alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine than was the case in the general population.  Contrary to other reports, this was not accompanied by higher rates of heavy use, although homosexuals did show higher rates of alcohol problems.  In the general population women consume less drugs and alcohol than do men, and substance use substantially declines with age.  Neither of these patterns were found for the homosexual sample, thus creating overall higher rates of substance abuse.  This may reflect differences between homosexuals and the general population in their adherence to sex-role stereotypes and age-related social role changes, as well as culturally specific stressors and vulnerability.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Christopher D. Tori, California School of Professional Psychology, 1005 Atlantic, Alameda, CA 94501.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Maladaptive behavioral and personality reactions to severe stressors among Mexican homosexual men were assessed by comparing substance abuse and Rorschach data obtained from three samples:  (1) homosexuals residing illegally in the United States (n=40), (2) homosexuals living in Mexico (n=21), and (3) heterosexuals living illegally in the United States (n=25).  The results of <BR>
orthogonal contrasts showed very similar personality structure and substance abuse patterns among the participants in the two homosexual groups.  As predicted, these men were found to be using alcohol or other drugs to a greater extent than the heterosexual controls.  Rorschach findings indicated that the homosexual subjects were experiencing dysphoric moods and distorted perceptions; they were also having significant difficulties coping with an environment that was discerned as increasingly dangerous.  These results are relevant to the stress reduction hypothesis of addiction and provide quantitative information regarding the extent of psychopathology in this underserved Hispanic population.  32 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Treatment of homosexual alcoholics in government-funded agencies was evaluated, with a focus on 36 agencies in the New York City area.  They were surveyed for information about training and attitudes toward the treatment of homosexual patients.  Approximately 160 responses were obtained that indicated limited knowledge about the evaluation and/or treatment of homosexual alcoholics.  Providers often did not discuss sexual matters, even when it was considered of importance.  About half of the providers believed that treatment programs would benefit from the presence of gay staff members.  However, as a rule, the development of homosexual-oriented programs was of low priority.  25 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Homosexuality as a lifestyle can be many things to many people.  For the gay or lesbian adolescent, it can lead to confusion, isolation, or a number of other serious problems, such as <BR>
attempted suicide.  These teens may seek out a mental health professional for support and accurate information.  This article reviews the current theoretical literature with respect to a number of key issues that can help mental health counselors be more aware and more effective in their delivery of services to this population.  Etiological, developmental, treatment, and resource issues are highlighted, and suggestions for future research are provided.  According to the author, mental health counselors can help gay men and lesbians develop innovative and satisfying ways to grow as gay people by (1) becoming more active and visible in reducing the public stigma of homosexuality; (2) making the investigation of suicide among gay and lesbian youths a priority; and (3) using gay and lesbian adolescents and adults who are comfortable with their lifestyle to work with those who have not been as successful in their attempts to cope.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Some research seems to indicate a significantly higher percentage of lesbian and gay alcoholism than in the general population.  For counselors to treat these patients in a constructive and effective manner, they must be able to focus on the alcoholism and ignore the client's sexuality unless and until it becomes a problem for the client.  Gays and lesbians learn to be homophobic from a very early age -- often as young as 5 or 6 years of age.  Internalized homophobia creates many problems and is almost certainly a factor in a gay client's substance abuse.  Counselors need to see sexuality as a part, not the total, of the personality.  Being gay or lesbian must not be seen as pathological.  It is necessary to accept homosexuality as within the sexual norm and within the natural order.  The genital act of homosexuality is not of itself immoral.  Counselors need to be aware of the many stresses on the gay or lesbian client that arise from society at large, from the gay society, and from within the client because of the homosexuality and the alcoholism.  The relevant dynamics in treating gays and lesbians are discussed.  75 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This qualitative study describes the identity transformation of lesbian recovering alcoholics in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  Open-ended interviews with the women provide the primary data for analyzing the process of transforming the stigmatized identity of lesbian recovering alcoholics (LRA).  This analysis examines the dynamic interaction between sexual identity and drinking, alcoholism recovery, and on-going sobriety.  Eight women who identified themselves as lesbian recovering alcoholics were chosen as participants in this study.  They were white, middle class, employed women between the ages of 30 and 45, from a large urban area, and were both lesbian and recovering alcoholics for at least 2 years.  Symbolic interactionism and some of the stage models of alcoholic and lesbian identity transformation provided the theoretical framework that guided the researcher.  The distinctions about and patterns of identity transformation that emerged from an analysis of the data are presented in eight profiles and five themes.  The five themes are:  (1) &quotI was different, alone, and afraid&quot; (2) &quotI drank to cope with being a lesbian, but ended up being an alcoholic&quot; (3) &quotI became a recovering alcoholic:  sobriety saved my life&quot; (4) &quotI accepted my lesbian identity in sobriety&quot; and (5) &quotI am a lesbian recovering alcoholic.&quot Finally, this study offers a stage model of lesbian recovering alcoholic identity transformation.  This model describes the process by which the women accept and integrate the two sub-identities of lesbian and alcoholic into the single, distinct identity of lesbian recovering alcoholic.  The model provides a basis for recommendations for further research and for clinical practice.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a need to incorporate three-generational family thinking into the discussion of treatment of lesbians and gay men, specifically those struggling with addictions.  The genogram is a method of diagramming family members.  Creating the genogram in the counseling session is a clinical intervention in and of itself.  It organizes the client's family history as the client provides the information.  A case example is provided illustrating that an expanded view of a client's family history and connections facilitates treatment.  It allows for the assessment of a presenting problem in context.  The fuller the assessment, the more opportunity for clinical interventions of reframing, recognizing themes, or restraining change.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article describes a holistic model for treating lesbian and gay people who are addicted to alcohol or other drugs.  The model was developed at Pride Institute, a 36-bed facility established in March 1986 near Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The author points out that a larger percentage of alcoholism is found among homosexuals than in the American population as a whole, then discusses some of the similarities and differences between homosexual and heterosexual alcoholics.  The treatment model, outlined in the final section, consists of three phases (assessment, clinical, and aftercare) plus a weekend family program for family members and other concerned people.  The treatment phase includes individual and group therapy, issue-oriented group meetings, relaxation training, meditation or prayer, instructional sessions, exercise and recreation, 12-step recovery meetings, and a homophobia program.  It is concluded that the internal and environmental stressors that affect all lesbians and gay men must be dealt with in an effective treatment program for that population.  36 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study was undertaken to discover both the similarities and differences in assessment and treatment approaches for heterosexual and homosexual clients.  The purpose of the study was to investigate to what extent sexual orientation is incorporated into treatment plans and what effect this had for treatment outcomes.  Responses to nine questions were obtained from 50 self-reporting heterosexual and 50 self-reporting homosexual clients of a range of treatment providers.  Differences were found at each stage of the assessment and treatment process.  There was evidence of sexual orientation not being used as a treatment factor.  For both groups there was evidence of inadequate significant-other involvement in treatment and post-treatment planning.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Many therapists may intellectually accept homosexuality, while remaining homophobic in their emotional belief systems.  Suggestions are offered to therapists working with lesbian and gay addicted clients for coping with their countertransferential and homophobic reactions.  The therapist's acceptance of homosexuality becomes crucial in helping the addicted client recover from his or her disease in which self-denial and self-hate are such significant factors.  It is detrimental to the recovery process when the therapist begins treatment with a client with an agenda to change the client's sexual orientation, or to define it as pathological, or to explore how it evolved.  In addition to low self-esteem, poor self-image, difficulty in relating, intense anxiety, and deep feelings of shame experienced by many clients who are in recovery, the homosexual client also may feel internalized homophobia resulting from the accumulated negative messages he or she has received from family, friends, and society.  Suggestions are made to help heterosexual therapists raise their levels of consciousness, gaining more knowledge about and a sense of ease with homosexuality.  Knowledge of addiction and its treatment is the other crucial factor in dealing with homosexual addicted clients.  It is suggested that maintaining a consistent and primary focus on physical and emotional sobriety is a critical factor in the addicts recovery regardless of whether the addict is heterosexual or homosexual.  Case examples illustrate the importance of focusing on sobriety ahead of sexual issues with recovering substance abusers and their significant others.  Once sobriety has been achieved, it is important for the therapist to accept any homosexual feelings the client may have; this is essential for the maintenance of sobriety and the emerging self.  Family of origin issues may arise during recovery, as well; it is important for the therapist to understand both the role of addiction in the extended family and the family's acceptance of homosexuality.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Ties That Bind:  Strategies for Counseling the Gay Male Co-Alcoholic <BR>
<I>Whitney, S. </I></B><BR>
New York, NY:  National Association of Gay Alcoholism Professionals, 10 pp.
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is stated that little specialized clinical work is being done with gay male alcoholics and still less is known about working with their co-alcoholic lovers, a person in the alcoholic's life who intervenes in such a way as to prevent the alcoholic from facing the consequences of his actions.  In this paper, some common co-alcoholic issues are described and strategies for treating co-alcoholics, specifically in groups, are discussed.  It is concluded that treatment personnel must look closely at the social system supporting the addictions of their gay male clients.  Also, it is important that those who serve in a co-alcoholic role within that system be contacted and, if possible, brought into treatment.  Since working in small groups that emphasize alcohol education, stress management, communication skills, and increased socialization within the gay community has proved effective in an outpatient setting, clients should be encouraged to involve themselves in Al-Anon to deepen their knowledge of co-addiction and to strengthen their support system.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Harper & Row, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This book applies the Twelve-Step recovery process used by Alcoholics Anonymous to the special concerns of homosexual substance abusers.  Substance addiction affects homosexual Americans at two to three times the rate of the general population.  The author describes a double bind faced by some chemically addicted homosexuals -- denying both their addiction and their sexuality.  The author contends that the first step on the road to recovery is acceptance of one's addiction and one's sexual orientation.  He draws on the experience of his own recovery as he presents and examines each of the Twelve Steps, relating each to the particular needs of the homosexual addict.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

In:  B. Carruth and W. Mendenhall (eds.) <I>Co-dependency:  Issues in Treatment and Recovery. </I>Binghamton, NY:  Haworth Press, Inc., 1989. 167 pp.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Co-dependence can be defined as a disorder of the relationship of the self to the self and to others.  The denial of self in order to feel connected to others is at the heart of co-dependence.  People create a false self in order to be who they think others want them to be because they cannot tolerate the fear of being alone or abandoned.  Society's homophobic teachings merge with and intensify its teachings about co-dependence and make gay men and lesbians and those with sexual identity issues especially vulnerable to becoming co-dependent.  The implications for treatment for gay men and lesbian co-dependents are that skilled counselors need to be knowledgeable about issues and problems specific to lesbians and gay men and take a creative approach to working with a non-traditional population.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Tailoring Treatment for Lesbians and Gay Men</B><BR>
<I>Addiction Letter </I>December 1991<BR>
(Available from Fraelean Curtis, 264 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02116.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lesbians and gay men who are addicted to alcohol or other drugs present unique treatment challenges.  This population suffers stigmatization and discrimination in a society that believes heterosexuality is normal and homosexuality is abnormal, and a society that fears and dreads homosexuals.  For them, recovery from addictions must include recovery from their own internalized homophobia and heterosexism.  Lesbians and gay men must transform two stigmatized identities, that of lesbian and gay men and that of the addict, into positive, affirming identities if they are to become clean and sober.  A five-state model of recovery from internalized homophobia and heterosexism is described, including pre-encounter, encounter, immersion and emergence, internalization, and synthesis/commitment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Although lesbian and gay youth receive services from multiple systems, including mental health, education, child welfare, juvenile justice, and health, historically these service providers have neither identified nor addressed the special needs of this population.  Most gay and lesbian youths emerge as healthy adults from the struggles associated with adjusting to a stigmatized minority status.  Estimates on the prevalence of homosexuality among adolescents vary widely; however, within gay and lesbian communities it is widely believed that approximately 10 percent of the population is homosexual.  Lesbian and gay youth of color live within at least three communities:  (1) their ethnic minority community; (2) the gay and lesbian community; and (3) the majority community.  Some gay and lesbian youths are at significant risk for serious depression and suicide.  Lesbian and gay youth are particularly vulnerable to alcohol and other drug abuse, as they seek to cope with the isolation, 
rejection, and stressors they experience.  Homosexuals are probably the most frequent victims of hate violence.  Group homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities, and juvenile detention facilities can be dangerous places for gay and lesbian youth, since they may be blamed by administrators when sexual or other assaults take place.  Pregnancy among teenage lesbians is not uncommon, since for some youth pregnancy is a method of concealing their sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>An overview is presented of the specific needs of lesbian alcoholics in treatment and recovery.  The underlying premise presented is that the barriers to effective treatment for the lesbian woman with alcohol problems are cultural and external, as well as intrapsychic and interpersonal.  Lesbians, as women, must recover from the physical effects of alcoholism and the social diseases of sexism and homophobia.  A feminist perspective on alcoholism is based on the understanding that an individual lesbian alcoholic must surrender to her powerlessness over alcohol and other mood-altering drugs while at the same time reclaiming her power as a woman and a lesbian.  The design and delivery of services to this segment of the population must address all of these factors if services are to be effective.  39 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>For the lesbian dealing with a dual stigmatized identity of chemical dependency and sexual orientation, treatment styles must be tailored to address the complex levels of anonymity of each individual.  As with any other population, chemical dependency in the lesbian population must be dealt with first; however, the key to ensuring ongoing recovery for the lesbian woman is to simultaneously address internalized homophobia.  Treatment professionals must be aware that when working with this population, a didactic approach is vital where the degree of non-acceptance is of primary concern.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The problems of women doubly stigmatized by society for being lesbian, as well as alcoholic or chemically dependent, are discussed.  Topics covered by this review include greater risk of alcoholism among lesbians because of higher than expected frequency of alcoholism among their families, heavy reliance on drinking environments as social meeting places, and ambivalence or conflict about sexual orientation.  Other topics include clinical assessment and treatment issues for alcohol or drug dependent lesbians; special issues that affect this group of women, including the role of self-help groups, denial and rationalization, negative affect, internalized homophobia, sexuality issues, involvement of the partner and extended &quotfamily&quot in the treatment process; and matters that therapists need to be aware of in treating lesbians for alcohol or other drug abuse, including facing up to their own homophobia, which, when it exists, may be expressed subtly and without awareness.  46 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from The Haworth Press, Inc., 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904-1580.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The article describes the legal status of lesbianism in the United States and other nations.  In the U.S., the legality of lesbianism is determined on a State-by-State basis.  It also discusses the psychiatric history of lesbianism and research on the prevalence and positive mental health of lesbians.  According to the author, nontraditional roles of lesbians can serve as a model of positive mental health for women in general.  Mental health statistics show that being single is psychologically healthier, possibly because married women often face a combination of employment plus full responsibility for housework and child care.  Lesbians have more long-term relationships, with emphasis on emotional closeness, love, and security.  Lesbian relationships include little risk of sexually transmitted disease.  Lesbian mothers lose 80 percent of all custody battles in lower courts and face other issues, such as homophobic remarks by others to the children, lesbian partners relating to the children, rearing male children, and coming out to children.  Lesbian feminists have been in the vanguard of social change, initiating alternative health care, feminist therapy collectives, women's shelters, and grassroots political organizations.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A study to learn how sobriety affects friendships in gay recovering alcoholic men is described.  The research sample included 20 gay recovering alcoholic males, each of whom had been sober for at least 1 year, who were interviewed.  The results of the study indicated that most of the subjects had lost friends, had many heavily drinking acquaintances, and were having difficulty meeting the responsibilities of friendships.  When sobriety had been achieved, the men were able to expand their friendship circles to others who were abstainers as well as to normal drinkers.  Nursing strategies for care of recovering gay alcoholics are discussed.  13 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the study was to identify variables that might be associated with perceived acceptance and social isolation among recovering homosexual alcoholics.  Participants (n=126) completed a questionnaire that included the Gay Perceived Acceptance and Social Isolation Scale (PASI).  Data were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression.  This procedure resulted in the selection of four independent variables which, as a set, accounted for more than 50 percent of the variation in PASI scores.  Three of the four terms related to sexuality:  perception that sexuality was a major cause of subject's alcoholism; perception that sexuality had nothing to do with alcoholism; and family awareness of the subject's homosexuality.  The fourth factor was the presence of alcoholism in the subject's biological family.  The overall results indicate that resolution of conflict concerning sexuality could lead to higher PASI scores and may increase the prospects of long-term recovery from alcoholism.  18 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Homosexuality </I>19(3):51-65, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between substance use and violence in lesbian relationships is discussed.  The study sample included 104 lesbians who responded to a 70-item questionnaire.  The survey results indicated that 39 subjects reported an abusive relationship, either past or present, and 64 percent reported the use of alcohol or drugs prior to or during abuse.  Frequency of drinking was directly and significantly related to the commission of abuse, as well as with being the victim of abuse.  It is concluded that increased efforts should be made to improve delivery of human and social services, including substance abuse services, to this population.  41 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors examine some of the ways in which the dominant culture transmits its anti-lesbian messages to individuals.  Focus is on factors, such as stigma, denial, alienation, and discrimination, which place lesbians at high risk to develop problems with alcohol and other drugs.  Some of the important issues pertaining to lesbians are discussed:  (1) family of origin as a source of stress; (2) extended family of the lesbians; (3) legality of lesbian partnerships; (4) &quotcoming out&quot process as a source of stress; (5) lack of visible mainstream models; and (6) lack of meeting places other than the bar.  Some suggestions for guidelines in working with lesbians and incorporating their needs into any project or program are presented, along with some of the available resources.  22 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between alcohol consumption and unsafe sexual practices was studied.  The research sample included 844 responses to a mailed 20-page questionnaire.  Of the sample, which ranged in age from 18-76 years, 80 percent were white, 52 percent were male, 76 percent were heterosexual, and 70 percent were college graduates.  The questionnaire specifically addressed the circumstances of sexual encounters that took place in conjunction with alcohol consumption.  The study results indicated that alcohol intoxication was related to unsafe sexual practices by homosexual men and heterosexual women but not by heterosexual men.  Respondents whose sexual partners were met in pickup locations were more likely to adhere to safe sexual practices.  It is suggested that the Combination of alcohol and sex may be significantly affected by the setting in which both occur.  30 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol consumption and drug usage by lesbian women are discussed in this review of the literature.  Headings within this book chapter include:  (1) the severity of the problems; (2) incidence; (3) triple stigmas; (4) what needs to be done; (5) prevention; and (6) treatment.  The incidence of gay men and lesbians at risk for alcoholism is usually cited as between 28 and 32 percent.  Most lesbian women alcoholics drink in order to cope with their internalized homophobia, their fear, and their shame.  The great majority of lesbian alcoholics will not willingly risk the price of self disclosure, passing as heterosexual in order to survive in a homophobic atmosphere.  They may feel isolated, shamed, and lonely; if they survive treatment, they are likely to be at risk for relapse.  The alcoholism field must help lesbians or women with sexual identity concerns recover from their addictions.  Prevention programs should address alcohol problems in high risk groups, including adolescent girls and women in their early 20's.  Professionals must commit to training, examining, and changing their attitudes, exploring their own sexual identity issues, and providing non-sexist, non-homophobic help to all women.  22 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In:  J. Ziebold and J. Mongeon (eds.) <I>Alcoholism and Homosexuality</I>, pp. 89-100. New York:  Haworth Press, 1982. 107 pp.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Major components of a prevention model for the gay community are described.  The approach is grounded in the belief that, for an alcohol abuse prevention program to be successful with a particular community, it must be sensitive to the values and norms of that community, be conducted by trusted and visible community members, involve a broad spectrum of the community leaders and opinion makers in its planning and implementation, and be integrated into the existing institutions and service delivery networks within that community.  An early intervention and outreach program for gay men and women identified as at risk with beverage alcohol is proposed.  The intervention component consists of an intensive, experimental group process that will encourage participants to develop more constructive alternative behaviors in their lives.  It is proposed that this intervention effort be accompanied by a public education and/or outreach campaign.  Using the formal and informal communications networks of the gay community and involving broad community representation can heighten gay awareness of the destructive consequences of alcohol misuse and develop additional alternative outlets exclusive of &quotbar and brunch&quot activities.  12 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Breaking the Silence:  Creating Safe Schools for Gay Youth<BR>
<I>Anderson, J.D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Student Assistance Journal </I>March/April 1994, pp. 21-23
<BLOCKQUOTE>An estimated 10 percent of school students are gay or lesbian.  Although the American Psychiatric Association and other organizations recognized the gay lifestyle 20 years ago, educators today do little to support gay and lesbian adolescents.  As a result of fear of discovery and lack of role models, gay and lesbian adolescents have a suicide rate two to three times higher than heterosexual youths.  Homophobia is worse among people who have never knowingly met a homosexual.  Therefore, the simplest solution, according to the author, is for more and more gays and lesbians to come out.  To make the school environment better for gay youth and staff, the Connecticut State Board of Education through its Equity Newsletter urged giving attention to inclusive language; challenging antigay epithets; designating resource people in the schools for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; making resources and materials visible and accessible; educating staff on homophobia; supporting gay and lesbian colleagues and using them as role models; and referring self-identified gay and lesbian students to appropriate services.  In 1993, the Massachusetts Governors Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth recommended several areas of concentration, including:  school policies protecting gay and lesbian students from harassment, violence, and discrimination; training teachers, counselors, and school staff in crisis intervention; school-based support groups for gay students; information in school libraries for gay adolescents; and curriculum that includes gay issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Research on the relationship between sexual orientation and suicide is limited both in quantity and quality.  The percentage of overall adolescent suicides committed by gay and lesbian youth is unknown.  Scientific data on the effectiveness and safety of suicide prevention programs is lacking; however, recent evaluations suggest that they are ineffective and may actually have unintended negative effects.  This review summarizes the literature on completed and attempted suicides among gay and lesbian youth, as well as the small scientific literature on programs aimed at preventing suicide among youth in general.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gay Parents in Addictions Treatment<BR>
<I>Segal, J.</I></B><BR>
<I>The Counselor </I>January/February 1994.  pp. 26-27
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gay and lesbian parents have unique needs; the normal rigors of parenting are greatly increased by being gay or lesbian.  Internalized homophobia and the shame developed by internalizing the negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians perpetuated by a homophobic society impact on self, parenting, and relationships.  It is necessary to address issues related to sexual orientation during recovery from addictions.  A number of effects of internalized homophobia on parenting that must be acknowledged in treatment are listed.  Clients may be self-conscious about their appearance and behavior.  They will avoid public and professional activities.  They may use their children to pass as heterosexual in the outside world.  Clients also may fear that their children will be gay or lesbian.  On the other hand, the client may be overly zealous in expressing his or her sexuality.  The process of coming out is a lifelong process, but it begins with coming out to oneself.  Clients must learn to accept who they are and be proud of the fact.  When dealing with children, clients must realize that coming out sends a clear message that honesty and integrity are values important to family relationships.  Professionals should consider bringing the children into treatment, so that accepting the parents sexual orientation becomes a family-oriented task.  While children of gay men and lesbians question their own sexuality at an earlier age, they are no more likely to be gay or lesbian than their peers.  The parent who has a healthy identity as a gay or lesbian is better prepared to explore strategies with his or her children to respond to homophobia attacks than the parent who personalizes situations and experiences guilt and shame.  On the positive side, children who grow up with gay or lesbian parents learn to accept and have a higher tolerance for differences in both themselves and in others, and they have greater exposure to new viewpoints and so are better able to expand their own thinking.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Data suggest that as many as 25 to 30 percent of lesbians have serious problems with alcohol and other drugs.  Due to the societal oppression that lesbians confront and the invisibility that results from that oppression, the problem goes largely unaddressed in most alcohol and other drug abuse recovery programs.  The stresses of dealing with ongoing and systematic oppression may manifest as low self-esteem, isolation, alienation, and despair within an individual.  The needs of lesbian alcoholics are discussed to raise awareness of these needs among service providers.  Delivery of meaningful recovery services to lesbians requires a thorough understanding of the lesbian lifestyle and the issues that impact it, including lesbian family units, lesbian mothers, survival of incest, a high incidence of adult children of alcoholics, and a significant number of relationships involving domestic violence.  This population, particularly during adolescence, is at extremely high risk for alcohol and other drug abuse; it is also a population with a very high suicide rate.  Strategies are offered for more successful recovery for these women, including strategies in the area of outreach (promotional materials, advertising and public relations, and community relations), administration (policies, procedures, and personnel), and programmatic concerns (staff training, program design and implementation, and followup care).  Additional resources are listed for further study.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>People who identify as lesbian or gay constitute a population that requires AOD problem prevention strategies consistent with their cultural experiences.  This handbook combines research and program experience knowledge.  It bridges the gap between academia and the field in understanding the AOD problems of gay men and lesbians.  The handbook is divided into six sections:  The first two sections provide background theory and research information.  Section one presents an overview of research-based knowledge of lesbian and gay AOD use patterns.  Because of a lack of funding, early studies of AOD abuse by gay men and lesbians were conducted on easily accessible subjects, such as bar patrons, mental health clients, and prisoners.  Random sampling techniques are difficult for such surveys because one must be willing to identify oneself as gay or lesbian to participate in these studies.  Also, not much is known about gay men and lesbians of color and gay and lesbian youth.   The author highlights seven key findings derived from research presented at the Research Symposium on Alcohol and Other Drug Problem Prevention among Lesbians and Gay Men in October 1992.  [Note:  Proceedings of the symposium are abstracted in this resource guide.]  The key findings are:  (1) the incidence of heavy use of AOD is about the same among lesbians and gay men as it is among their heterosexual counterparts; (2) fewer lesbians and gay men abstain from AOD than do their counterparts; (3) lesbians alcohol use patterns are more similar to those of gay and heterosexual men (that is, a higher rate of use) than to patterns of heterosexual women; (4) although there is little evidence that addiction rates are higher among lesbians and gay men, some studies find that lesbians and gay men report higher rates of AOD-related problems; (5) gay men and lesbians appear to use other drugs at substantially higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts; however, alcohol is clearly the drug of choice; (6) as people get older, their AOD use tens decrease.  Among gay men and lesbians, this decrease appears to be not as substantial as among the general population; (7) the rate of AOD use among gay men and lesbians may be declining.  Section two discusses the concepts of prevention, risk, and resiliency.  Examples of risk factors in the gay and lesbian communities include alienation, isolation, and low self-esteem; lack of connectedness to a supporting, caring community; a belief that AOD use is necessary to one's identity; and a reliance on AOD to reduce inhibitions to engage in sex.  A strong resiliency factor is connection to and identification with a lesbian and gay community.  Key prevention principles are listed.  The last four sections describe specific prevention approaches.  Section three discusses the Lapis Program of the Alcoholism Center for Women, which uses alternative activities, topical support groups and workshops, and community outreach to reach African-American and Latino lesbians.  Section four describes the LYRIC Program and Project Ten, which provide a parallel social and recreational network for adolescent gays and lesbians who are barred from full participation in normal teenage activities.  Section five discusses the environmental approach to AOD prevention.  It describes the Stepping Stone, an alcohol treatment and recovery program serving primarily lesbians and gay men.  Section six looks at the link between HIV and AOD and the need for HIV and AOD prevention fields to work together to develop effective strategies.  A list of resources and a bibliography are included.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Counseling Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Persons with Alcohol and Drug Abuse Problems.<BR>
<I>Neisen, J.</I></B><BR>
Arlington, VA:  NAADAC Education and Research Foundation, 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This monograph provides an overview of the salient issues in counseling lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals with substance abuse problems.  It reviews the literature on the prevalence of substance abuse in the gay population and points to recent sociological approaches that emphasize the role of cultural victimization in explaining heavy drinking and drugging in the gay community.  Heterosexism and homophobia are defined and case examples are presented that indicate how cultural victimization contributes to substance abuse.  The coming out process for lesbians and gays is discussed to help alcoholism and drug abuse counselors recognize the particular risks for heavy drinking and drug use at various stages of the coming out process.  Issues of counselor sensitivity are presented as well as guidelines to improve counselor proficiency in facilitating the stages of healing for lesbians and gays with substance abuse problems.  Guidelines are identified for working with lesbians and gays and their families.  This includes information on working with both the family of origin and family of choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse in a Gay/Lesbian Population:  Related to Victimization? <BR>
<I>Neisen, J., and Sandall, H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality </I>3(1), 151-168, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors address possible connections between alcohol and drug addiction, homosexuality, and child sexual abuse.  They review the literature on homosexuality and alcoholism and point to (1) the lack of empirical studies on this issue; (2) changing perspectives on both alcoholism and homosexuality in the last two decaded; and (3) past psychoanalytic literature that assumed a causal relationship between homosexuality and alcoholism in contrast to more recent sociological explanations that suggest gays and lesbians may be liable to turn to drinking and drugging as a response to the cultural prejudice they face.  The authors conducted a retrospective clinical case study on 201 gay and lesbian individuals at Pride Institute, an inpatient alcohol and drug treatment program specifically designed to meet the needs of gays and lesbians, to provide information regarding the prevalence of sexual abuse among chemically dependent gays and lesbians.  They found a large number of clients reporting a history of sexual abuse.  The researchers attributed three factors to these reports of abuse:  (1) the safe, supportive environment provided at Pride Institute was conducive to disclosure to sensitive information, (2) Pride Institute staff routinely and thoroughly assess for histories of sexual victimization, and (3) assessment of sexual abuse continues beyond the evaluation stage of treatment and into primary treatment, including workshops on abuse, group therapy, and individual therapy with the clients primary therapist, staff psychologist, and staff psychiatrist.  This study discusses the importance of addressing sexual abuse issues in chemical dependency treatment and the importance of recognizing how cultural victimization and sexual victimization contribute to drinking and drugging.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Black, Gay, and Alcoholic Men:  Their Character and Treatment<BR>
<I>Icard, L., and Traunstein, D.M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Social Casework</I>, 68(5), 267-272, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors focus on normative factors of the black and the gay communities and show how these factors converge to affect the character (abuse and dependence) and treatment of black, gay alcoholic men.  Assuming that black men are proportionally represented among homosexual men, as many as 1.3 million black men may be homosexual, according to the authors.  They also estimate that the rate of alcohol abuse among black gays is similar to white gays--one out of three.  Gay black men are a double minority, subject to harsh social treatment by racist and antihomosexual attitudes.  Moreover, they are often stigmatized by both the black and gay communities.  The sharp cultural differences between the black and gay communities often force the black, gay person to choose between being black or being gay.  This alienation often contributes to the individuals abusive drinking behavior.  In treating the black, gay alcoholic, attention should be focused on (1) the persons drinking behavior, (2) black cultural influences; (3) the persons gay self-concept; and (4) his reference groups in the black and the gay communities.  The black, gay alcoholic may be mistrustful of mental health services and not seek services as readily as white, gay alcoholics.  In successful treatment, the client must (1) control his drinking; (2) gain a better understanding of himself; and (3) recognize the range of choices available to him as a sober, recovering, functioning, emotionally healthy black, gay male.  He has to develop skills of assertiveness, communication, positive self-appraisal, and development of a positive support system.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Working with Lesbian Alcoholics<BR>
<I>Anderson, S.C., and Henderson, D.C.</I></B><BR>
<I>Social Work </I>30(6), 518-525, 1985
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors describe the myths and realities of lesbian experience, review the literature, and discuss the need to overcome homophobia among social workers and in agencies.  Lesbian alcoholics experience a triple burden of social stigma.  In treating lesbian alcoholics, attention must be focused on drinking behavior, low self-esteem, coming out, role expectations, and parenting.  There is little systematic research on the relative effectiveness of treatment modalities with lesbian alcoholics; most reports are anecdotal and involve small samples.  The authors review individual, couples, family, and group therapy and AA and suggest treatment strategies that address the special problems and needs of lesbian alcoholics.  It is critical, say the authors, that traditional alcohol treatment programs and other social service settings begin a dialogue with their respective homosexual communities, hire lesbian staff, or provide their nongay staff with opportunities for education and attitudinal change.  There is an urgent need for research on alcoholism among lesbians; large samples and longitudinal designs are particularly needed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Transexuality, Identity, and Empowerment:  A View from the Front Lines<BR>
<I>Warren, B.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>SIECUS Report</I>, February/March 1993, pp. 14-16.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Transexuals are people who find their gender identity (the inner sense of self as male or female) in conflict with their sexual anatomy, says the author.  Manifestations range from occasional cross-dressing, to living full- or part-time in the gender opposite of ones sexual anatomy, to taking hormone therapy, and ultimately to undergoing sex reassignment surgery.  The author reports on the support groups of the Gender Identity Project (GIP) of New York Citys Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center.  After sex reassignment surgery, the person is technically no longer transexual; however, many continue to use the term to describe their unique experience.  Approximately 50 percent of male-to-female transexual women who participate in the Centers GIP report an attraction to women; these transexuals describe themselves as lesbians.  Male-to-female transexual women attracted to men describe themselves as heterosexual women.  Female-to-male transexual men who are attracted to men describe themselves as gay men.  Female-to male transexual men who are attracted to women identify as heterosexual men.  GIPs mission is to enable transexuals to develop a positive, affirmed identity in an environment of support and self-acceptance.  The authors report the controversies about proper diagnosis upon which to base treatment decisions and the reluctance of physicians and mental health professionals to treat transexuals.  The authors conclude there is a need for a non-judgmental, educated, affirming and community-based response to the needs of people who are experiencing gender identity conflict.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Misconceptions about Womens Sexuality:  Understanding the Influence of Alcoholism<BR>
<I>Covington, S.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Focus on Family and Chemical Dependency </I>9(2):6-7, 44, 1986
<BLOCKQUOTE>Throughout history, alcohol has been viewed as an aphrodisiac for women.  Data, however, suggest a social learning explanation of how drinking affects sexual behavior; due to psychological factors, a woman's experience of arousal may be totally opposite of her measured physiological arousal response.  The author reviews data on women's sexuality and chemical dependency.  Looking at data from Hite and Masters and Johnson, there was a marked shift in choice of sexual partners before, during, and after phases of alcoholism.  Before alcoholism, 74 percent of the women reported they were exclusively heterosexual; 20 percent bisexual; 6 percent lesbian; and 3 percent no information.  During the alcoholism period, 57 percent reported they were exclusively heterosexual; 37 percent bisexual; and 6 percent lesbian.  In sobriety, 66 percent reported they were heterosexual; 17 percent bisexual; and 17 percent lesbian.  The author concludes that alcohol can be an important survival mechanism in a society hostile and nonsupporting of lesbian relationships, as it helps a woman to deny her sexual identity.  The author concludes that treatment providers must look at themselves and their attitudes, values, and knowledge about alcohol and other drug use, and acknowledge that sexuality and chemical dependency are intertwined in women's lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>The Prevalence and Demographic Predictors of Illicit/Licit Drug Use Among Lesbians and Gay Men:  The Trilogy Project <BR>
<I>Skinner, W.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Public Health </I>84 (8)1307-1310, 1994,<BR>
(Available from William F. Skinner, Ph.D., Department of Sociology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0027.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Studies on illicit/licit drug use among gay men and lesbians have focused primarily on gay men, employed limited drug measures, and have been conducted in cities known for large gay and lesbian populations.  This paper examines (1) the prevalence of 12 illicit/licit drugs by gender and age group and (2) the demographic predictors of past year frequency of marijuana, alcohol, and cigarettes.  Self-report data were collected on 455 gay men and lesbians living in a southern state, using organizations mailing lists.  Differences were found between gay men and lesbians in the use of specific substances and the demographic predictors of drug use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Assessing Risk in the Absence of Information:  HIV Risk among Women Injection-Drug Users Who Have Sex with Women<BR>
<I>Young, R.M.; Weissman, G.; and Cohen, J.B.</I></B><BR>
<I>AIDS & Public Policy Journal </I>7(3):175-183, Fall 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lesbian/bisexual injection drug users (IDUs) are ignored, confused, mistreated, and miseducated by the majority of AIDS research, education, and service programs, say the authors.  Lesbian/bisexual IDUs are at risk for HIV not only because of their sexual and injection behaviors, but also because they believe they are at low risk.  Scientific information about woman-to-woman sexual transmission is badly lacking.  Institutional denial of the possibility of lesbian risk by researchers, policy makers, and drug treatment, as well as HIV program staff has resulted in a failure to provide appropriate risk reduction education to this group.  Since lesbians are assumed (mistakenly) neither to be mothers nor to have sex with men, HIV research on lesbians in unlikely to be done.  Researchers tend to study and describe not simply &quotwomen&quot but &quotwomen of reproductive age&quot; this suggests that concern for women among many epidemiologists and policy makers is not based on concern for womens health but rather on concern for protecting men and infants.  The authors review the limited evidence on risky drug use and sexual behaviors of lesbians/bisexual IDUs.  HIV infection risk may differ according to both the gender of sexual partners and self-reported sexual identity.  Six recommendations to provide this population with information to reduce their HIV risks are provided.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Chemical Dependency and Relapse in Gay Men with HIV Infection:  Issues and Treatment<BR>

In <I>Counseling Chemically Dependent People with HIV Illness. </I> The Haworth Press, Inc. 1991, pp. 79-90.<BR>
(Available from Triangle Treatment, Robinson Institute, 1841 Broadway, New York, NY 10023.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chemically dependent gay men with HIV infection need counseling services because (1) substance use may exacerbate their already compromised immune system; (2) substance use may cause disinhibition and noncompliance with risk reduction behaviors, resulting in reinfection or infection of others; and (3) substance use may result in progressive deterioration of quality of life.  To assist counselors in providing services specific to the needs of gay men with HIV who are chemically dependent, the authors discuss relapse prevention and intervention strategies and present a case illustration.  The conditions of distress that may lead to relapse in gay men who are HIV positive must be appreciated by the counselor to provide effective treatment.  These concerns include HIV-associated distress; internalized homophobia; external homophobia; socialization in gay bars; disrupted social and intimate relationships; vocational functioning, finance, and physical health; or use of substances to control moods, thought processes, or behavior.  Treatment programs and individual providers must do more than not assume all men in recovery are heterosexual or HIV negative; they must offer a safe and supportive atmosphere for all clients to explore their unique concerns about maintaining abstinence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gay and Alcoholic Epidemiologic and Clinical Issues <BR>
<I>Paul, J.P.; Stall, R.; and Bloomfield, K.A.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health & Research World </I>15(2), 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors review the literature on the prevalence of alcoholism among gay men and lesbians, as well as the risk factors for alcohol abuse in the gay and lesbian communities.  They also review recommendations from the treatment literature on clinical interventions for gay and lesbian alcoholics.  The article is organized around questions crucial to understanding alcohol abuse and alcoholism in the gay and lesbian community:  (1) Do elevated rates of alcoholism exist in the gay community? (2) Are rates of alcohol abuse in the gay community changing? (3) What are the risk factors for alcohol abuse in the gay community? (4) Is there a need for gay-sensitive alcoholism treatment programs? (5) How can existing treatment programs respond to the needs of gay alcoholics? and (6) How can gay alcoholics obtain the social support necessary to maintain sobriety?  Early studies that oversampled bar patrons estimated that one out of three gay men and lesbians abused alcohol and other drugs (AOD).  Later studies based on sampling techniques designed to approximate community-wide samples of gay men found considerably lower rates of AOD abuse among gay men.  Several gaps exist in the epidemiologic literature concerning AOD use by gay men and lesbians.  First, no effort has been made to approximate a community-based sample of lesbians.  Second, most of the research on gay men and lesbians has relied on samples that are white and middle class.  Third, nearly all of the literature on gay and lesbian drinking practices has come from the largest urban centers.  Formal training in treatment issues specific to gay alcoholics and knowledge of the gay community is needed among alcoholism professionals.  Gay alcoholics have difficulties seeking treatment at many mainstream treatment settings and may encounter prejudicial attitudes and nonacceptance from heterosexual staff.  As a result of the AIDS epidemic, major changes have occurred over the last decade in how gay men and women approach the health care system and in their expectionthat service providers be responsive to their needs.  Alcohol and other drug abuse treatment providers may face increasing pressure to become familiar with and to accommodate the specialized needs of their gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Being Gay<BR>
<I>Struve, J.</I></B><BR>
Talk given by Jim Struve at Decatur Hospital, Georgia, on November 12, 1993.
<BLOCKQUOTE>This speech was given at the opening of the Common Steps treatment program at Decatur Hospital in Georgia.  The author begins by presenting his personal history of struggle as a gay man.  Treatment programs must address an additional level of dysfunction that, if ignored, will leave clients at increased risk for relapse.  For gay men and lesbians, daily living in our society imposes all the trappings of a dysfunctional system.  The author lists five essential areas of functioning within any system:  authority and leadership who use their roles to nurture rather than control members; open and spontaneous expression, rather than constricted and controlled communication; flexible norms and rules that adapt to special circumstances, rather than rigid rules enforced by external controls; respect for healthy differences between people, rather than intolerance for nonconforming behavior; and communication and mutual respect used to resolve conflicts, rather than coercion.  Treatment programs must assist clients in discovering alternative coping strategies for living in a world that discriminates against gay men and lesbians.  Treatment providers need to move beyond a clinical focus and address political issues, as well.  To be supportive, they must actively promote alternatives to the underground culture of bars, so gay men and lesbians have safe and healthy ways to meet and socialize.  Gay and lesbian clients must be encouraged to learn about their cultural heritage, and positive role models must be made available.  Finally, according to the author, treatment programs must deal directly with the homophobic forces of organized religions that portray gay men and lesbians with an evil vengeance.   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Specific Approaches and Techniques in the Treatment of Gay Male Alcohol Abusers<BR>
<I>Smith, T.M.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Alcoholism and Homosexuality</I>, pp. 53-69. Binghamton, NY:  The Haworth Press, 1982<BR>
(Available from Haworth Press, 10 Alice Street, Binghamton, NY 13904-1580.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author presents an extended discussion of specific therapeutic approaches and techniques with homosexual male alcohol abusers, including dealing with low self-esteem, sober sex, getting high, getting &quotfar out&quot sexually, double lives, second rate relationships, social bonding, and aging.  In this paper, the bias of treatment approaches is toward individualized, interpersonal, holistic eclecticism:  a combination of responsibility building therapy, awareness therapy, medical and neurophysiological approaches, strategic therapy, use of altered states of consciousness, and attitudinal change therapy.  Knowledge of the gay subculture, of the various surroundings in which the gay alcoholic lives, and of the varying attitudes within the gay world, is essential in helping the therapist to understand the client and his problems and to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.  The therapist needs to be aware of the many stresses upon the client that arise from society, from the gay subculture, and from the clients psyche, not only because of gayness, but also because of the alcoholism.  Many gay male alcoholics are oppressed in several different ways by assaults on different aspects of their personality and constitution.  Since the client often does not describe these pressures, the therapist must be attuned to what the client might be experiencing and must then confirm and affirm these presumptions by discussions with the client.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Lesbian and Gay Psychology:  Theory, Research, and Clinical Applications<BR>
<I>Greene, B., and Herek, G.M. (eds.)</I></B><BR>
Thousand Oaks, CA:  SAGE Publications, Inc., 1994
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is the first of a series of planned annual publications sponsored by the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian and Gay Issues of the American Psychological Association.  Its aim is to provide a forum for the dissemination of contemporary lesbian and gay affirmative perspectives that are distinctively psychological.  It is no longer sufficient simply to acknowledge that gay and lesbian sexual orientations are within the realm of psychological normalcy.  Mental health professionals are challenged to explore the complexities and subtleties of lesbian and gay sexual orientations; the unique developmental tasks and stressors among lesbians and gay men; the special nuances and dynamics of same-gender relationships; and the treatment of lesbian and gay clients from diverse racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds.  They are called upon to design programs of research and to include material relevant to these issues in the training of psychologists in the broadest sense.  This volume includes empirical studies on the children of lesbians, internalized homophobia, lesbian and gay male development, and aspects of relationship quality in cohabiting couples.  Theoretical analyses of the relationship between the feminist political movement and choice in sexual orientation, sexual pride and shame in lesbians, and lesbians and physical appearance are also included.  The role of individual differences in reactions to lesbians and gay men and empirical research with the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale are reviewed, as well as a discussion of appropriate therapeutic boundaries when lesbian therapists treat clients within the lesbian community.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>MMPI-Derived Prevalence Estimates of Homosexuality among Drug-Dependent Patients<BR>
<I>Craig, R.J.</I></B><BR>
<I>The International Journal of the Addictions </I>22(11), 1139-1145, 1987
<BLOCKQUOTE>Based on the best MMPI index available (Question 69, &quotI am very strongly attracted to members of my own sex,&quot answered &quottrue&quot; and Question 430, &quotI am attracted to members of the opposite sex,&quot answered &quotfalse&quot), prevalence estimates of homosexuality among 225 drug-abusing clients in treatment were placed at 11 percent.  The rate among black cocaine freebasers was 17 percent, and among black opiate users the rate was 10 percent.  These rates are two to three times the rate of homosexuality among the general population.  They may be an underestimation because of our inability to detect hidden homosexuality among those persons wishing to remain undetected in gender orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Agenda</I>, November 30, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) includes questions about sexual orientation and sexual behavior in the Womens Health Initiative, the largest study of women's health ever conducted by the Federal Government.  It is a $600 million study that will survey and track 160,000 women ages 50 to 79 about their health.  Data is expected to be available in 1996.  The study has three components:  an observational trial will track the health of 100,000 women for 9 years; clinical trials will determine the effect of prevention and early intervention on 60,000 women; and a test will gauge the effectiveness of educational messages about health care on women who have traditionally been underserved by the Nations health care system.  Researchers hope the study will tell medicine how to end the alienation of lesbians from health care.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Changes in Levels of Alcohol Consumption:  United States, 1983-1988 <BR>
<I>Williams, G.D., and Debakey, S.F.</I></B><BR>
<I>British Journal of Addiction </I>87, 643-648, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using data from the 1983 and 1988 National Health Interview Surveys, this study examines changes both in the prevalence of abstention and the prevalence of heavier drinking among drinkers in the United States.  Changes are examined separately by gender and according to other sociodemographic characteristics often associated with different levels of alcohol consumption.  Results suggest an increase in abstention and a decrease in heavier drinking between 1983 and 1988.  For women, decreases in heavier drinking were found among those 18 to 44 years of age, among those employed, and among those divorced, separated, or never married.  For men, decreases in heavier drinking were found among those employed, among those with family income of $25,000 or more, and among those married, divorced, or separated.  Changes both in abstention and heavier drinking were found to vary considerably by geographical region.  These findings do not support results from other general population survey studies on alcohol use that suggest a stability in drinking levels, or even a slight increase in heavier drinking among men.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Bloomfield, K.</I></B><BR>
<I>Drug and Alcohol Dependence </I>33, 257-269, 1993
<BLOCKQUOTE>An elevated rate of alcohol problems is believed to exist in the gay and lesbian community.  However, prevalence estimates suggesting this have generally been based on convenience samples that have over-represented bar patrons and clinical sources.  Recent epidemiological studies examining risk factors for AIDS have gathered information on alcohol consumption, as well as sexual orientation.  Data based on improved sampling methods are now available for estimating drinking rates of lesbians and gay men.  This study compares the drinking patterns of heterosexual women and lesbian/bisexual women who were recruited through a random sampling design in San Francisco.  Contrary to previous research, no statistically significant differences in alcohol consumption and drinking patterns between these two groups were found.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Intensive interviews with 10 lesbian alcohol abusers revealed dependency needs, low self-esteem, and a high incidence of depression.  Decreased drinking increased power-related behaviors, enhanced self-esteem, and for many subjects increased feelings of depression.  The findings suggest that lesbians with alcohol problems need therapists who will accept their sexual orientation and treatment that will help them increase their sense of power and esteem without alcohol.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Counseling Gay and Lesbian Native Americans<BR>
<I>Tafoya, T., and Rowell, R.</I></B><BR>
In <I>Gay and Lesbian Health Care Resources</I>, M. Shernott, ed., Gay and Lesbian Professional Health Care Association, 1988
<BLOCKQUOTE>Native American gay men and lesbians combine elements of common gay experiences with their own unique culture.  Historically, some tribes gave gays special gender status, even believing they represented elements of the sacred.  The authors report that depression is diagnosed among Native Americans at a rate four to six times higher than with whites and suggests that alcohol may be seen as self-medication to deal with the depression.  In traditional cultures, Native Americans sought assistance from a medicine person or healer.  The healers treatment approach might have included therapeutic metaphor, rituals, change of status, involvement of the family network, and self-mastery.  Little emphasis was put on insight.  As a result, family therapy is often the treatment of choice for Native Americans.  If the family has had difficulty with accepting the individuals sexual orientation, the family therapy could provide the means of re-integrating the individual into the family.  The authors remind therapists that words have different associations and nuances among different cultures.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Sexual Diversity in Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention<BR>
<I>Eversole, T.</I></B><BR>
<I>New Designs for Youth Development </I>11(2), 1994.  Multiple Strategies for Multiple Issues, Module 2
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans are at increased risk for alcohol and other drug abuse. Substance abuse programs have not addressed the prevention needs of sexual minorities, citizens who comprise greater than 10 percent of the people at risk.  The author looks at sexual minorities and prevention and offers suggestions for addressing this critical need.  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities are typified by their own history, customs, and values, as well as social and behavioral norms.  There are clearly identified cultural festivals, holidays, rituals, symbols, heroes, language, art, music, songs, and literature.  Certain risk factors are more prevalent for sexual minority youth than for other young people:  (1) history of family addiction; (2) physical, sexual, or psychological abuse and victimization; (3) school dropout; (4) attempted suicide; (5) low self-esteem/efficacy; (6) inadequate social services; (7) homelessness; (8) pro-use norms in the community; and (9) lack of healthy role models.  The author outlines program strategies for prevention that can be undertaken within an entire community to increase resiliency factors and decrease risk factors facing sexual minority youth.  These include outreach and inservice training programs for service providers, mentors, and foster parents; programs to change community attitudes; alcohol and other drug free events for gay and lesbian youth; programs that increase the visibility of healthy, nonabusing, adult role models for lesbian and gay youth; AOD prevention programs by straight parents on behalf of their gay and lesbian children; family advocacy programs that address the issues of homophobia, cultural consciousness, communication, and substance abuse; inservice education of educators; peer support groups; alternative activities; and a hotline with information services to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and their families.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol Problems in Several Midwestern Homosexual Communities<BR>
<I>Lohrenz, L.J.; Connelly, J.C.; Coyne, L.; and Spare, K.E.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>39(11)1959-1963, 1978
<BLOCKQUOTE>The authors focused on the extent and nature of alcohol problems in homosexual communities in the midwest and on the attitudes of homosexual alcoholics toward traditional mental health <BR>
resources and Alcoholics Anonymous.  According to their scores on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, close to one-third of the homosexual men surveyed in four urban areas of Kansas were alcoholics.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Suicidal Behavior in Adolescent and Young Adult Gay Men<BR>
<I>Schneider, S.G.; Farberow, N.L.; and Kruks, G.N.</I></B><BR>
<I>Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior</I>, 19(4), 381-394, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship of homosexuality to suicidal behavior was explored by questionnaire responses from 52 men in gay and lesbian college organizations and 56 men in gay rap groups.  A family background of alcoholism and physical abuse, social supports perceived as rejecting of homosexuality, and no religious affiliation were associated with a history of suicidal ideation, reported by 55 percent of the participants.  Racial/ethnic minorities tended to be overrepresented among suicidal, as compared to nonsuicidal gay men.  Suicide attempts reported by 20 percent of the sample were most often associated with intrapersonal distress and occurred most often while individuals were closeted and/or in the context of recent rejection for being homosexual.  Nearly all attempters were aware of their homosexual feelings, but had not yet established a &quotpositive gay identity&quot at the time of their first suicide attempt.  Suicidal behavior in gay youths may be the product both of familial factors that predispose youths to suicidal behavior and of social and intrapersonal stressors involved in coming to terms with an emerging homosexual identity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>EAP Digest </I>8(6):26,69-70, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses the inception and development of the employee assistance program (EAP).  It was begun to motivate workers with alcohol problems to improve performance rather than risk losing their jobs.  EAPs have progressed from being informal arrangements between physicians and members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to being considered an integral element in identifying and treating alcoholics.  Some EAPs are sponsored by unions; others, by management.  Joint EAPs, in which unions and management work together, are considered better than either of the preceding two types for several reasons: (1) Joint efforts are believed to be more effective in motivating workers' acceptance; (2) union representatives are perceived as more sensitive than management to alcohol abuse and other employee problems; (3) joint committee activities increase EAP visibility; and (4) informal communications between management and unions enable more flexibility and better cost and procedure monitoring.  6 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The organization, methods, and effectiveness of employee assistance programs (EAPs) are discussed.  While early EAPs emphasized the late stages of the disease of alcoholism, many of those in place today consider other health and behavioral problems, family members, and deteriorating job performance.  By 1980, approximately 10 million employees were covered by EAPs.  A clearly written policy for all EAPs should be required.  Once the policies have been developed, case-handling procedures should be established.  Most companies will insist that involvement in the EAP be kept separate from personnel records and that participation in an EAP should not affect promotions or raises.  However, participation in an EAP should not protect an employee from disciplinary action if job performance is unsatisfactory. Recovery rates for EAPs have gone as high as 60 to 80 percent; savings on sick pay have reached as much as $2 million a year.  For many employees, an EAP may be the last hope for recovery. Information and hotline telephone numbers are provided.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>EAP Digest </I>8(2):55-59, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Components of a needs assessment for an employee assistance program (EAP) are described.  It is suggested that an EAP needs assessment is necessary, not only from the financial perspective but also from the perspective of providing properly integrated counseling services to employees and their families.  The needs assessment will provide useful, systematically collected information for choosing the most appropriate EAP services and delivery systems to meet particular employee needs.  The components of the needs assessment might include:  company sources (employees, supervisors, union representatives, management), community sources (mental health, financial, legal, and drug rehabilitation counselors), direct and indirect sources (surveys, interviews, personnel and organizational records).  These components should address both employee and company concerns (mental health, drug and alcohol dependence, personal problems, job satisfaction and performance).  It is suggested that the savings resulting from a well-designed EAP will offset expenses incurred by the needs assessment.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>EAP Guidebook to Building New Thinking Skills <BR>
<I>Appelgate, G.; Hamlin, R.; and Rudd, F. </I></B><BR>
<I>ALMACAN </I>18(4):16-20, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Employee assistance programs (EAPs) and a Skill Development Model for use with EAPs are discussed.  EAPs affect individuals and entire organizations.  By learning and teaching a re-thinking process, members of EAPs are able to achieve a higher recovery rate when working with substance abuse and emotional disorders.  EAPs in southern California,  using the Skill Development Model have achieved a recovery rate of over 85 percent.  The process initially trains EAP professionals to become Master Teachers, who then assist in the training process for a larger group, the Certified Resources. The larger group, which may comprise 10 percent of the workforce, then assists in presenting Skill Development to the entire workforce.  The emphasis is on using the skills on the floor in the every-day processes of working together and the final step may take 4 to 6 months to complete. The presentation to the entire workforce in a 2-day workshop is the beginning of a cultural change that will take place over the following year, as the role modeling, coaching, and teaching by the Master Teachers and resource staff become effective in defining the choices people can make, in rethinking strategies that can change out of control to in control and  negative stress to opportunity.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Getting the Most from the Self-Help Network <BR>
<I>Eisman, C. </I></B><BR>
<I>ALMACAN </I>18(4):24-27, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effectiveness of self-help groups is discussed.  There is evidence that participation in self-help support groups may be linked to an improvement in symptoms of physical and mental illness.  In addition to Alcoholics Anonymous and other groups for alcoholism and drug abuse, there are self-help groups available to help with death, divorce, physical abuse, parenting difficulties, psychological issues, overeating, and even sex addiction and overspending.  The self-help group is a coming together of people to share a common problem and exchange emotional support and practical information.  The primary source of help is the members themselves.  The link between employee assistance programs (EAPs) and workplace self-help groups can be very effective.  The major concerns of self-help groups in the workplace are confidentiality, sensitivity to employee's concerns, and assuring that employee participation is not reflected on employment records.  It is noted that on-site self-help groups have worked in some locations and not in others. It is suggested that self-help groups can help reduce use of professional services and can develop independence and self-direction. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Criteria are provided for evaluation of the following aspects of employee assistance programs (EAPs):  policy development, employee orientation, supervisor training, availability during nonbusiness hours, assessment and diagnostic services, crisis counseling, referral, quality assurance, program evaluation, and cost.  Many larger corporations as well as smaller companies now sponsor or contract with groups of mental health professionals to provide EAPs.  These programs deal with psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug addiction, and stress-related problems.  Factors that have influenced the increasing demand for EAPs include corporations' concern for employees with mental health problems, a desire to contain rising health costs and reduce corporate losses, and the need for effective supervisory systems for managing troubled employees.  Most programs are broad-based, covering services that may be less clinical and more preventive, including health risk appraisal, diet and nutritional counseling, stress reduction training, biofeedback, exercise instruction, and parenting.  A large number of the centers have expanded into fully integrated mental health care delivery systems, and it is conjectured that the organizational distinction between EAPs and mental health maintenance organizations (HMOs) may soon disappear.  18 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Growth and Transformation in Workplace Alcoholism Programming <BR>
<I>Roman, P.M. </I></B><BR>
In:  <I> Recent Developments in Alcoholism,</I> M. Galanter, ed.  pp. 131-158.  New York: Plenum Press, 1988.  <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The origins of contemporary workplace programs providing assistance to employees with alcohol-related problems are described.  First, the emergence of employee alcoholism programs and major changes in definitions and formal reactions to alcohol problems are considered.  Nearly all intervention strategies follow the broad outlines of the employee assistance program (EAP) design:  basic programs based within a work organization and staffed by an organization employee; external-program models characterized by the presence of a formal contract with an external agency; programs based in a labor organization; and programs for members of a profession.  The success of these programs is described with findings from a survey of 480 private company sites.  Increasing rates of self-referral for assistance with alcohol problems are noted, indicating that self-referral is a major component of workplace intervention programs.  Basic research knowledge is summarized, together with a projection of new studies considered to be critical for maximizing the effectiveness of alcoholism intervention in workplace programs.  Throughout, the large-scale impact of workplace programming is emphasized, with an urging for greater attention to these activities by the alcohol research community.  38 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Posttreatment Follow-up, Aftercare, and Worksite Reentry of the Recovering Alcoholic Employee <BR>
<I>Foote, A., and Erfurt, J.C. </I></B><BR>
In:  <I> Recent Developments in Alcoholism,</I>M. Galanter, ed.  pp.  193-204.  New York:  Plenum Press, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The literature on the impact of aftercare and followup, particularly of employed alcoholics, is reviewed.  While the long-term nature of recovery from alcoholism is well known, most studies on aftercare cover short posttreatment periods and the data suggest that 6 months is too short a period for adequate aftercare.  The prevention of relapse is a posttreatment activity and the prime objective of aftercare, and the employment problems of alcoholics have not been adequately covered as it has been assumed that patients will make a smooth transition into the work world after treatment.  A nontraditional system of aftercare assumes that the provider must seek out the patient if the service is to be effective.  Although employed alcoholics tend to show higher recovery rates than unemployed ones, the rates of relapse among employed alcoholics are still high.  It is suggested that worksites and employee assistance programs (EAPs) should pay more attention to followup and aftercare, and that additional research is needed to examine the effects of different types of aftercare content; the impact of followup aftercare on relapse prevention; and the cost effectiveness of various aftercare and relapse prevention strategies.  46 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>New Occupations and the Division of Labor in Workplace Alcoholism Programs <BR>
<I>Blum, T.C. </I></B><BR>
In:  <I> Recent Developments in Alcoholism,</I>M. Galanter, ed.  pp.  205-221.  New York:  Plenum Press, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The development of employee assistance programs (EAPs) as a new occupation is described.  The employee assistance specialty has recruited individuals from existing occupations and is in the certification process. The certification boundaries assure that those with clinical training must have competency in alcohol and drugs, an area often omitted or poorly covered in many clinical training programs.  However, technical developments in the workplace have produced more rationalized and bureaucratic alcohol interventions, and the relationship of EAPs and treatment agencies has been influenced by the availability of third party insurance payments and treatment facilities appropriate for employed individuals.  With the innovation of job performance deterioration as an indicator of personal troubles came a necessity for careful policy formulation in EAP implementation and the need to broaden the focus to include problems other than alcoholism.  The standards for the development of new programs cover policies and procedures, administrative functions, education and training, resources, and evaluation. It is suggested that with so many practitioners whose experience can determine the training necessities, the occupation is ready to make its claims.  24 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>EAPs and Managed Care:  A Blurring of the Lines <BR>
<I>Lee, F.C. </I></B><BR>
<I>EAP Digest </I>8(5):20, 75, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The evolution of employee assistance programs (EAPs), benefit plans, and cost-containment strategies is discussed.  It is suggested that the battle lines are forming between individualized treatment plans and &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; approaches to rehabilitation.  The firms that can offer high quality managed mental health programs that include all available services will be in high demand by employers.  EAP firms are forming relationships with case management firms.  The problems that arise when case management and EAP firms are combined are enumerated: order of responsibility, reporting, referrals, expertise, continuity, evaluation, and costs.  It is suggested that as managed care environments develop, EAP practitioners will move to the more comprehensive programs and the number of free-standing EAPs will be limited.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Work Reentry Contracting:  An Essential Component in Treating the Employed <BR>
<I>Morse, G.A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Professional Counselor </I>3(2):47-48, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The recovering client's system of personal and social support after treatment is often inadequate in the workplace.  Work reentry contracting involves the recovering person (or client), one or more treatment center counselors, and one or more significant people from the employing entity.  In stage 1, &quot;increasing staff's industrial awareness,&quot; one or more staff members become familiar with the workplace realities the client faces. Convincing the client of the worth of reentry contracting is stage 2; it should be presented as an option, never forced.  Stage 3 is the contracting meeting to set up contact between treatment staff and the employee assistance program (EAP) counselor or employer.  Possible contract responsibilities of the client, the employer, and the treatment center are listed.  Possible payoffs of work reentry contracting for treatment centers are outlined.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article describes the development of employee assistance programs (EAPs) in the United States. &quot;Occupational programming&quot; began some 50 years ago.  The 1944 founding of the National Committee for Education on Alcoholism, which became the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA) in 1949, was a significant influence.  A decade later NCA began efforts with industry on programs reflected in current EAPs.  The work of such notables as Lewis F. Presnall, Ross A. Von Wiegand, and Leo Perlis is reviewed, including the Chino Mines program and AFL-CIO involvement.  Labor and management emphasized common objectives, although their viewpoints differed.  The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) began new activities on occupational alcoholism and EAPs in the 1970s.  NIAAA trained occupational program consultants (OPCs) to conduct employee assistance programming.  Program highlights are listed.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol consumption by commercial airline pilots is discussed.  The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits any pilot from flying within 8 hours of ingesting alcohol or flying under the influence of alcohol.  Individual air carriers impose additional prohibitions against alcohol consumption.  These rules are enforced through direct observation of cockpit crews during preflight check-in. Airline safety depends on detection and treatment of active alcoholism as well as on detection of preflight drinking, since it is thought that practicing alcoholics may suffer a critical loss of reaction time, even when their blood alcohol levels do not indicate recent consumption. A successful employee assistance initiative may contribute to the near absence of alcohol involvement.  Lead responsibility for the commercial pilot program now rests with the Aeromedical Office of the Air Line Pilots Association, located in Denver.  In addition, a self-help organization, Birds of a Feather, has been endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) which offers a support program.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article clarifies the implications of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that classified alcoholism as &quot;willful misconduct&quot; and thereby rejected two veterans' requests to extend their 10-year period of eligibility for veterans' educational benefits. Employee assistance program (EAP) professionals must combat that part of the Court's decision that referred to authorities being &quot;sharply divided&quot; on whether or not alcoholism is a disease. EAP practitioners are encouraged to write representatives and senators, telling them that alcoholism and other drug dependencies are indeed diseases and that much progress has been made in treating and preventing them.  Authorities should be urged to support the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA) and the National Association of Addiction Treatment Programs (NAATP).  Legal remedy is required to enable veterans ill with alcoholism to receive their benefits without difficulty and to ensure that the insurance industry does not try to restrict coverage using the Court's decision.  12 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Beyond Testing:  Coping With Drugs at Work <BR>
<I>Wrich, J.T. </I></B><BR>
<I>EAP Digest </I>9(1):55-63, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses efforts to deal with drug abuse through drug testing initiatives (DTIs) in the workplace.  Broadbrush employee assistance programs (EAPs), in existence for more than 15 years, have largely been ignored in this effort although they are very effective in cutting absenteeism, encouraging recovery, minimizing relapse, reducing treatment costs, and bettering productivity by drug abusers and alcoholics.  More than 35 percent of the country's largest companies have DTIs, and more are beginning them.  The author believes, however, that they are based on questionable assumptions.  The history of how companies have dealt with alcoholism is outlined, especially broadbrush EAPs, begun by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in 1972.  Significant benefits of EAPs are described and the problems of working with DTIs are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Fisher, P.D. </I></B><BR>
<I>EAP Digest </I>96(3):22, 78, 81, 1989.<BR>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>Ways to maximize employee assistance programs (EAPs) are described.  EAP professionals can use a number of techniques, including attitude, presentation, education, and establishment of a task force to help enlist the cooperation of top management.  Medical professionals within the organization play key roles in EAP use by being alert to signs of chemical abuse and giving appropriate referrals.  Union officials can also play a role in employee use of EAPs.  It is concluded that EAP professionals can establish effective programs and can create a referral cycle that will maximize EAP use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Does Coercion Work?  The Role of Referral Source in Motivating Alcoholics in Treatment </B><BR>
<I>Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly </I>5(3/4):5-22, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The evaluation of the effectiveness of coercion in alcoholism treatment has been a neglected issue.  The underlying principle of the employee assistance model, the threatened loss of a desired benefit, is used in an inner-city outpatient program to keep alcoholics in treatment by establishing &quot;therapeutic contracts&quot; with referral sources.  This study finds that patients' recovery (6 months uninterrupted stay plus maintenance of abstinence) is significantly and positively related to coercive referral sources (family, job, and welfare). Also, different referral sources are effective for different types of patients, according to the core-identity variables of sex, ethnicity, birth region, and age.  This information can be used to enhance the chances of recovery of attrition-prone patients.  33 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined characteristics of referrals to employee assistance programs (EAPs) associated with subsequent termination of employment.  As well, relationships between characteristics of the referrals and program characteristics were explored.  Longitudinal data were collected at several time periods for 163 referrals to EAPs from five organizations.  Survival analysis was conducted to determine which variables were associated with termination of employment.  Females, cohabitating couples, and employees who worked for the organization for 5 or more years were most likely to remain employed.  One interesting finding was that people with alcohol problems were significantly more likely to be formal referrals.  12 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Employee Assistance Program Utilization and Client Gender <BR>
<I>Brodzinski, J.D., and Goyer, K.A. </I></B><BR>
<I>Employee Assistance Quarterly </I>3(2):1-13, 1987. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between use of employee assistance programs (EAPs) and client gender is discussed.  The study group included 15,000 Federal employees and their dependents from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, with 1,162 individuals who used an EAP actually responding.  The results of the study revealed that males self-referred to an EAP less often than had been expected, while females self-referred more often than expected.  In addition, women use the EAP for less intrusive problems such as family, eating disorder, financial and legal problems while men are referred to the EAP by their supervisors for chemical dependence.  It is suggested that these differences may be related to differences in socialization of men and women in the United States.  21 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The corporate alcoholism and substance abuse policies and procedures of the Westinghouse Corporation are discussed, with a focus on security observations and drug screening.  The benefits of drug screening are supported by reports from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PGE) which experienced a 40 percent decline in the rate of serious injuries following institution of screening programs.  Therefore, Westinghouse, being committed to the health and safety of its employees and recognizing that drug and alcohol abuse are widespread social problems, has instituted a program that includes supervisor intervention, replacement assessment, and drug screening.  The corporate procedure includes alcohol and other drug abuse and prescribes actions to deal with substance abusing employees, including employee assistance programs.  The goal of the program is to detect evidence of substance abuse, determine prevalence, and deter employee misuse of controlled substances.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The employee assistance program of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) is discussed, with an emphasis on problems of substance abuse. Following union negotiations and extensive review of alcohol and drug abuse problems, WMATA implemented an employee assistance program (EAP).  The program provides for employees who volunteer for its services and for employees who test positive for drugs or alcohol following an incident or accident on the system.  Employees in rehabilitation for alcohol abuse remain 30 days minimum in the program; marijuana abuse, 90 days minimum; and cocaine, PCP, heroin and other drug abuse, 180 days minimum.  It is concluded that the program is currently effective, due to well-planned and executed procedures. Cooperation between management and labor is crucial to the success of such a program, if it is to address company concerns while safeguarding employee rights.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

Headings within this article include:  (1) alcohol abuse; (2) employee assistance programs; (3) the psychology of control in people; (4) stages of adulthood; and (5) futuristic implications.  In the current society, where the needs for expertise, consulting, government service, and conference activities add to the heavy work-load of the professorate, it may be difficult for professors to keep up in their field of knowledge as the knowledge base expands.  Health facilities and hospitals, along with primary care centers will increase the emphasis on self care, prevention, and education.  7 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The BITE is a 32-item questionnaire that measures supervisors' attitudes toward troubled employees, those who might become involved in occupational alcoholism programs or employee assistance programs.  The study group included 237 supervisors from two companies in the automotive industry who responded to the BITE.  The results, which revealed characteristics of supervisors' attitudes, suggested that the BITE includes four valid and reliable factors:  industriousness, resistance, acrimoniousness, and disaffection.  These factors contribute to the understanding of how supervisors recognize troubled workers.  34 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Working Under the Influence (WUI):  Correlates of Employees' Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs<BR>
<I>Hollinger, R.C. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):439-454, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Major theoretical perspectives on employees' substance abuse are presented.  Data from an anonymous mail survey administered to 9,175 employees of 47 organizations in 3 industries were analyzed with a focus on age, gender, social interaction with coworkers, and job satisfaction. The study results indicate that those employees most likely to work while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are males under the age of 30 who feel unhappy about their jobs and who socialize frequently with coworkers away from the place of employment after hours.  Previous studies of the construction industry were successful in motivating employees with substance abuse problems to obtain treatment in order to save their jobs.  However, it is concluded that current Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) may have to reconsider their programs in light of younger employees who may not share the fear of losing their employment and may come to work under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  56 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Perceptions of an Employee Assistance Program and Employees' Willingness to Participate <BR>
<I>Harris, M.M., and Fennell, M.L. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):423-438, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Perceptions of an employee assistance program (EAP) and employees' willingness to participate in EAP activities were assessed in a sample of 150 employees of a white collar firm, with a focus on attitudes, perceptions, and willingness to use various resources for help.  Study results suggest that men and women are equally willing to use EAPs.  However, their attitudes and perceptions are influenced by their familiarity with the program in the case of women and by perceptions of program effectiveness, personal attention, and controls in the case of men.  It is noted that familiarity may be easily enhanced through newsletters and brochures.  Organizations can influence and direct these factors to increase employee participation in their EAPs through efforts of management and program personnel. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Purveyor Organizations and the Implementation of Employee Assistance Programs <BR>
<I>Blum, T.C., and Roman, P.M. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):397-411, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Purveyor organizations, which market employee assistance programs (EAPs) to others are discussed, with a focus on the ways they influence the implementation of EAPs.  The study group included 724 occupational program consultants from purveyor organizations who responded to a survey addressing various components of EAPs.  The study results supported the hypothesis that the greater the purveyor's integration of and control over its subunit for EAP service delivery, the more relationships the purveyor will have with treatment organizations and the higher its level of sociopolitical acceptability, the more successful it will be in implementing EAPs.  It is suggested that organizations implementing EAPs should integrate EAP subunits with other company functions and should take into consideration networks with other community resources. Equally important is development of managerial strategies to guide and control the EAP service delivery units.  40 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Ideology and Referral Categories in Employee Assistance Program Research <BR>
<I>Sonnenstuhl, W.J.; Staudenmeier, W.J., Jr.; and Trice, H.M. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):383-396, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of cultural referral categories in studies of alcohol treatment programs is discussed in this review of the medical and psychiatric literature.  Headings within this article include:  (1) conflicting ideologies and referral categories:  a historical context; (2) supervisory referral:  the job performance model; (3) peer referral:  union reaction to the job performance model; (4) self-referral:  counselors' reactions to job performance; (5) the ballooning of the self-referral label and its social consequences; (6) the use of cultural categories in employee assistance program (EAP) outcome studies; and (7) constructing a grounded theory of seeking help from an EAP. It is concluded that when clients are admitted to an EAP, they should be asked about all other interventions they have experienced, which may help determine those methods that work best in a given work environment.  In addition, knowledge of those interventions that have been effective might be useful in determining what motivates employees to seek help and in designing therapy strategies that take advantage of previous client experiences.  68 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Contrasting Employee Assistance, Health Promotion, and Quality of Work Life Programs and Their Effects on Alcohol Abuse and Dependence <BR>
<I>Sonnenstuhl, W.J. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):347-363, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effectiveness of employee assistance programs (EAPs), health promotion programs (HPPs), and quality of work life (QWL) efforts are compared, with a focus on their theoretical background, their methods, and their effectiveness in treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism. It is noted that although the three programs have the common goal of improving employees' well-being and increasing productivity, they are basically competing social movements.  As such, they are characterized by different beliefs about what should be changed and have different orientations towards prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence.  EAPs are based on social learning theory and use a dual strategy of confrontation and counseling; HPPs have been primarily a means of improving health and containing health care costs by teaching adoption of healthy living habits; and QWL stresses the restructuring of jobs and work place relationships to enhance morale and productivity.  118 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse and the Work Place, with Special Attention to Employee Assistance Programs:  An Overview <BR>
<I>Steele, P.D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):315-325, 1988. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Substance abuse in the work place is discussed in this brief review of the literature, with a focus on employee assistance programs (EAPs).  Headings within this article include:  (1) substance abuse in the work place as a social issue; (2) causes; (3) consequences; (4) responses; (5) substance abuse in the work place and social influences; (6) societal influences; (7) organizational influences; (8) program influences; and (9) future directions for research and theory.  It is noted that research has focused on larger firms and their substance abuse problems, which may create a bias in the understanding of drinking and drug problems in the work environment.  It is suggested that future research studies should include the secondary employment sector, with its different organization structure, work group characteristics, work history, and substance abuse patterns.  55 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Management Perspectives on Alcoholism:  The Employer's Stake in Alcoholism Treatment <BR>
<I>Bernstein, M., and Mahoney, J.J. </I></B><BR>
In:  <I> Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency in the Workplace,</I>C. Wright, ed.  pp. 223-232. Philadelphia:  Hanley and Belfus, Inc., 1989.  <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The role of the employer in alcoholism treatment is discussed.  Headings within this article include:  (1) direct and indirect costs of illness and injury; (2) from occupational alcoholism programs to employee assistance programs (EAPs); (3) employee assistance programs, including expansion of benefit plans; (4) the health care cost crisis; (5) costs of alcoholism; (6) employer responses; (7) managed mental health care; (8) proposed approach; (9) occupational medicine and the cost of care; and (10) the alcoholic employee. It is concluded that in those organizations where management is sensitive to alcoholism and alcoholism treatment, the prognosis for those employees suffering from this disease is good.  It is stressed that a greater variety of services should be available, particularly intensive outpatient treatment. Treatment of the working alcoholic is beneficial for the employee who receives effective individualized treatment and for the employer who regains the full productivity of the employee.  26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Reprints available from Sheila T. Fitzgerald, RN, The Johns Hopkins University, Division of Occupational Health, 615 North Wolfe Street, Room 7503C, Baltimore, MD  21205.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The role of the employee assistance program (EAP) in helping the troubled worker is discussed, with a focus on history, structure, steps in development, program administration, evaluation, and funding.  Headings within this article include (1) EAP history; (2) the troubled worker and evaluation of job performance; (3) organizational needs assessment, including evaluation of organizational resources and establishment of company policy; (4) program characteristics, including EAP models and EAP selection; (5) EAP administration and EAP evaluation.  It is concluded that the worksite may be the best setting for primary preventive health care efforts. It is noted that EAP services have expanded from occupational alcoholism programs to a wide range of services addressing problems from relationship difficulties to burnout. </BLOCKQUOTE>

It is concluded that drug testing can be used to protect employee health and safety but only so long as the rights of the employees are not violated.  All testing programs should ensure accuracy, due process and confidentiality, and at the same time work for the rehabilitation of the drug or alcohol using employee.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Employee Assistance Programs in Context:  An Application of the Constructive Broker Role <BR>
<I>Steele, P.D. </I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Applied Behavioral Science </I>24(4):365-382, 1988.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of the constructive broker role by practitioners in employee assistance programs (EAPs) is discussed in the context of the labor process model, which assumes inherent ideological conflicts between management and labor.  Four strategies of constructive brokering are described, with an emphasis on the broker's awareness of his/her role, the consequences of applying the concept in the workplace, and the following practical issues that must be considered: (1) network mobilization; (2) functional marginality; (3) selective adaptation; (4) identity management; (5) cost containment; (6) role definition; and (7) professionalism.  The final goal of the constructive broker in a contentious work place is humane treatment for troubled workers.  70 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The economic implications of workplace health promotion programs are discussed in this review of the literature. Headings within this article include:  (1) program area-specific findings; (2) employee assistance programs (EAPs); (3) smoking cessation; (4) nutrition and weight loss; (5) exercise; (6) stress management; (7) motor vehicle safety belt programs; (8) back injury prevention; and (9) health risk appraisal.  It is concluded that there is little methodologically sound empirical understanding of the effects on both behavior and health of workplace health programs.  Additional studies are required to validate the assertions of the economic merits of workplace health promotion measures.  27 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This article provides an overview of employee assistance programs (EAPs), presents research data on aspects of their operation in relation to employee alcohol problems, and outlines some of the problems of and prospects for EAPs in dealing with alcohol problems in the work force. Headings within this article include:  (1) the emergence and growth of EAPs; (2) referrals and program utilization for alcohol-related problems; (3) EAP administration; (4) supervisory and managerial involvement; (5) issues for the future; and (6) alternative approaches. Suggested alternative approaches include alcohol education, alcohol control policies, and wellness programs at the workplace.  However, it is clear that EAPs are making substantial contributions to dealing with the national alcohol problems and are doing so in a context of voluntary action without public subsidy.  17 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Smith-York, J.E. </I></B><BR>
<I>Employee Assistance Quarterly </I>5(2):87-90, 1989. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An Aftercare program, which is a part of the employee assistance program (EAP) of the State of New Jersey, is described.  The program includes Aftercare Group Meetings, which are recovery support groups, separate from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The group program provides a transition from rehabilitation/treatment programs into the 12-step programs of AA and NA.  In the current State program, employees who go into treatment must attend Aftercare for at least 1 year, attending group meetings on a weekly basis for the first 3 months, bimonthly for the second 6 months, and once a month for the last 3 months.  The Aftercare groups focus on how to stay away from drugs of choice, living drug free, and what is needed for recovery.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Reprints avaible from Keith McClellan, Director of EAP Services, Multi Resources Centers, Inc., 24275 West Twelve Mile Road, Suite 310, Southfield, MI 48034.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This  paper describes early invention in addictive and mental health disorders.  It suggests that supervisors should proactively reach out, engage and involve addicted workers in behavioral change by taking the initiative to inform the EAP counselor and asking an employee to set up an appointment.  Early intervention involves lifestyle changes through conversation. It focuses on assisting rather than penalizing addictive workers.  It is important to identify the basic cause of abnormal behavior in the case of mental health disorders to achieve an appropriate solution. It states that prepaid counseling services are not effective in reaching addictive problems in the early stages of addictive disorders, because most addictions involve depression. It is concluded that an employee assistance program can show cost savings when it achieves early identification of addictive and mental health problems.  5 Ref. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the early 1970's, the implementation of occupational alcoholism programs and employee assistance programs have gained widespread acceptance and growth in American work organizations. Although the occupational alcoholism program model implies a direct relationship between participation in treatment and improved job performance, little research exists that substantiates the efficacy of the model.  Seven variables which are systematically documented in every employee's personnel record were analyzed for 35 alcoholism program clients and a comparison group of 58 non-problem employees at a large public utility in the northeastern United States. The criteria of short-term absence, long-term absence, written warnings, suspensions, tardiness, medical clinic visits and on-the-job accidents acted as the operationalized definition of the dependent variable job performance.  This study found significant expected improvements of the alcoholic group at the point of 1-year follow-up.  Most observed improvements, however, were not sustained by the third year following intervention.  More refined performance and outcome measures are recommended, as well as attention to program implementation evaluation. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>From the Acting Director of CSAP...</H3>
<P><B>Those individuals who have physical disabilities are at risk for developing alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems.  Social isolation, chronic pain, increased dependence on prescription drugs, and enabling by family members, cause many people with disabilities to turn to AOD to ease their loneliness and pain.  Unfortunately, due to physical complications, this populations suffers even more serious adverse effects of AOD than the general public does.</P>
<P>This resource guide provides information to assist counselors, physical therapists, and mental health professionals in their understanding and interactions with individuals with disabilities.  I hope that the resources included in this guide will help us prevent AOD abuse among this underserved population in our country.</P>

<B>Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990: Public Law 101-336</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of Public Law 101-336, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, is to provide clear enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities and to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing these standards.  Within the Act, the term &quotdisability&quot means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment.  The law provides protection against job discrimination in the private sector for alcoholics and recovered drug abusers, although current users of illegal drugs are excluded from the definition of disabled. Titles within the Act include: 1) Employment; 2) Public services, prohibition against discrimination and other generally applicable provisions, actions applicable to public transportation provided by public entities considered discriminatory; 3) Public accommodations and services operated by private entities; 4) Telecommunications, including relay services for hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals and closed-captioning of public service announce-ments; and 5) miscellaneous provisions. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Use and Abuse among Mentally Retarded Persons: A Comparison of Patients and a Survey Population<BR>

<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</I> 14(1):109-123, 1988<BR>
(Available from Joseph Westermeyer, University of Minnesota, Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse, Minneapolis, MN  55455.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Substance abuse among mentally retarded persons, first described 55 years ago, has received little or no attention by specialists in mental retardation. With deinstitutionalization, this problem has reappeared, often followed by victimization (i.e., assault, rape, robbery). In this study the demographic characteristics, family and childhood history, substance use patterns, and substance-related problems of 40 mildly mentally retarded persons are compared with those of 40 mildly mentally retarded persons without substance abuse problems. Similarities with substance abusers who are not mentally retarded are noted. Recommendations for alleviating this serious problem among mentally retarded persons are made. 15 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Gladys A. Kearns, Union County Council on Alcoholism, 300 North Avenue East, Westfield, NJ  07090.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hearing world, including those in the treatment community, exhibit strong insensitivity to the special needs of hearing-impaired persons. Hearing-impaired persons may withdraw from the hearing world or deny the existence of a hearing loss. These behaviors at the least lay the groundwork for isolation, and it has been suggested that a high level of frustration may increase the incidence of alcohol abuse among the hearing-impaired population. Treatment professionals recognize that these traits decrease the likelihood of identifying problems, minimize a client's acceptance of special needs, and reduce the probability of a positive treatment outcome. Alcoholism treatment service providers forge a critical link in the service delivery and recovery chain for the hearing impaired alcoholic. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Alcohol Health and Research World</I> 13(2):104-109, 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol consumption is a strong predisposing factor in traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury can mean many long-term psychological and behavioral difficulties, including impairment of memory, decreased self-awareness and insight, impairment of abstract reasoning, deficits of attention and concentration, inappropriate social behavior, changes in mood and effect, language and communication deficits, sensory deficits, vocational/educational problems, and impact on the family and community. Brain injury survivors present unique problems for counselors and other professionals because the psychosocial and functional consequences of brain injury complicate the already difficult tasks of evaluation and treatment. Cognitive and neurobehavioral problems may have an impact on assessment, diagnosis, intervention, treatment, and case management. 26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Diagnosing Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Learning Disabilities with Chemically Dependent Adolescents<BR>
<I>Ralph, N., and Barr, M. A.</I></B> <BR>
<I>Journal of Psychoactive Drugs:  A Multidisciplinary Forum</I> 21(2):203-215, 1989<BR>
(Available from Norbert Ralph, Ph.D., 3550 Pacific Avenue, #306, Livermore, CA  94550.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The diagnosis and treatment of chemically dependent adolescents with a second diagnosis of learning disabilities (LD) or an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) poses a challenge. Like other so-called dual diagnoses, these conditions must be assessed against the background &quotnoise&quot of the adolescent chemical dependency syndrome. This syndrome is coincident with the onset and cessation of chemical dependence and abuse. A diagnostic framework for assessing chemically dependent adolescents is presented, with specific reference to the differential diagnosis of LD and ADHD from other conditions. The role of LD and ADHD is assessed with regard to being a risk factor for chemical dependence in adolescence. Treatment approaches, on both an inpatient and outpatient basis, with the chemically dependent adolescent who also has an LD or ADHD are discussed. 51 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drug Abuse among Mentally Retarded People:  Overlooked Problem? <BR>
<I>Delaney, D., and Poling, A.</I></B> <BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education</I> 35(2):48-54, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Few studies examining the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs by mentally retarded people have appeared. Although some mentally retarded people experience alcohol, and to a lesser extent drug problems, prevalence rates appear to be relatively low. Reasons are speculative. Subsequently, little is known concerning the kinds of treatment likely to benefit mentally retarded people with drug-related problems. 22 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Adelaide Whitehouse, M.D., The Center for the Rehabilitation and Training of the Disabled, Chicago, IL 60614.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A summary is presented of available information regarding the special characteristics and needs of hearing-impaired alcoholics and drug addicts. The obstacles to this population receiving treatment are even more formidable by the minimal adherence in the chemical dependency field to the legal mandate that agencies and institutions receiving Federal funding must provide services accessible to disabled persons. The Illinois Task Force on Substance Abuse Among the Hearing Impaired was established to examine the needs of this population in Illinois. The results of a needs assessment conducted by the Task Force are summarized. The conclusion is reached that the minimal accessibility of hearing-impaired individuals to substance abuse treatment reported in the literature extends to Illinois as well. The concerns of agencies in attempting to meet the needs of this population are cited. Specific recommendations are made to program changes to improve the level of substance abuse services accessible to hearing-impaired individuals. 17 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Dennis Moore, SAIP, School of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, OH  45401.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although increased attention has been directed toward the special risks for substance misuse of persons with disabilities, there continues to be a paucity of epidemiologic data detailing prevalence and potential etiologies for use. This review describes the research problems contributing to the limited findings in the field. The risk factors of special relevance to persons with disabilities are discussed, and the data related to specific disabilities are presented. A hierarchy of research needs is suggested, along with several working hypotheses concerning substance use/misuse and persons with disabilities. Finally, current issues affecting intervention and treatment services in this field are discussed. 87 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Diabetes<BR>
<I>Crane, M., and Sereny, G.</I></B> <BR>
<I>British Journal of Addiction</I> 83(12):1357-1356, 1988<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between diabetes and alcohol consumption is discussed. It is noted that alcohol abuse is causally related to the development of diabetes and that once diabetes has developed in the chronic alcoholic, it may be very difficult to control. The following facts are stressed: 1) sudden loss of blood sugar control or fluctuations in sugar levels may indicate alcohol abuse and not diabetes; a glucose tolerance test should be preceded by 4 weeks of abstinence; 2) regular daily alcohol intake of 50 to 60 g of absolute alcohol is not compatible with good diabetes control; 3) physicians treating diabetics should use available screening methods to identify alcohol abusers. It is concluded that unless the clinician is aware of the alcohol- insulin effect on glucose metabolism, diabetes may be diagnosed in many problem drinkers who, in fact, do not have diabetes. 12 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</I> 69(9):765, 1988<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol is a causal factor in as many as 50 percent of traumatic injuries such as head injury. Anecdotal evidence and recent research suggest spinal cord injured patients (SCIPts) differ from the general population on incidence of antisocial behavior and substance abuse. Pre-injury psychosocial and cognitive characteristics of SCIPts may complicate treatment and the recovery process. Yet treatment implications of substance abuse in SCIPts have been neglected. The purpose of the study was to identify pre-injury behavioral patterns of SCIPts. A structured interview was administered 2 to 8 weeks post-injury to 30 consecutively admitted SCIPts (24 male and 6 female) in acute care medical settings. Psychosocial, educational and employment information was compiled. Additionally, interviewers rated SCIPts' post-injury behavior using the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale. Thirty-three percent of the SCIPts were unemployed at the time of injury. Thirty-two percent had been convicted of crimes other than driving violations. Finally, 7 percent of SCIPts had received treatment for alcohol abuse, and 10 percent had been in substance abuse programs. Additional data analysis will focus on relationships among pre-injury patient characteristics and post-injury behavioral ratings. Implications for treatment of SCIPts with histories of chronic unemployment, substance abuse, and a variety of anti-social behaviors will be discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Abuse among Youth with Disabilities:  Prevention Research Update No. 7<BR>
<I>Prendergast, M.; Austin, G.; and deMiranda, J.</I></B> <BR>
Report. Western Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities, Southwest Regional Laboratory, Los Alamitos, CA, 1990. <BR>
(Available from Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, 101 SW Main Street, Suite 500, Portland, OR  97204.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prevention implications of new research on substance abuse among youth with disabilities are abstracted and reviewed. This new information is placed in the context of past findings. People with disabilities have been identified as one of the Nation's largest special populations at high risk for alcohol and other drug abuse problems. Information about AOD use and prevention among people with developmental, learning, hearing, visual, and mobility impairment is examined. This review is divided into four sections: 1) limits of information; 2) nature and extent of the problem; 3) correlates of use; and 4) prevention and intervention issues. The paucity of information available on AOD use among disabled youth hampers efforts to draw precise conclusions. People with disabilities experience the same psychological and social pressures to use and abuse alcohol and drugs as people who are nondisabled; however, many also experience additional psychological, emotional, and social problems associated with their disability that increase the risk for substance abuse. The evidence indicates that it is essential that persons with disabilities receive AOD prevention and intervention services as part of their regular educational or rehabilitation programs. 159 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Blindness and Visual Impairment: Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention & Treatment<BR>

(Available from Leonard F. Burns, M.A. 3121 Park Avenue, Suite 1, Soquel, CA  95073.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relationship between blindness and visual impairment (BVI) to alcohol and other drug-related problems is explored. It is contended that the unique psychosocial stressors experienced by the blind or visually impaired, combined with cultural factors unique to this population, are responsible for higher rates of AOD abuse. The handicaps that result from visual impairment can be divided into three categories: 1) difficulty obtaining information; 2) difficulty in mobility; and 3) personal isolation. The unemployment rate among BVI persons who wish to work is high. This results partially from discrimination in employment and partially from a mixture of poor job skills, negative self-concept, and lack of motivation. The differences in those BVI persons whose condition is congenital and those whose condition is adventitious are discussed. Treatment issues are examined for BVI persons. Successful outreach efforts also are discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation,</I> 5(3):9-20, 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol use by persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) was evaluated. The research sample included patients who were recruited from a brain injury rehabilitation clinic. Information regarding patterns of alcohol use were obtained from patients (N=7) and primary caretakers (N=87), who responded to the Quantity-Frequency-Variability Index (QFVI), a General Health and History Questionnaire and the brief Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST). When compared to controls of similar ages, a slightly higher proportion of persons with TBI were abstinent and a significantly higher proportion were heavy drinkers before their injury, while after their injury, fewer persons with TBI were classified as heavy drinkers than were the uninjured controls. However, the number of problem drinking patients was still significant following injury. 26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Allen W. Heinemann, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, 448 E Ontario Street, Suite 650, Chicago, IL 60611.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of alcohol and drugs by persons with recent spinal cord injuries was investigated. The research sample included 103 persons with spinal cord injuries, who gave lifetime histories of substance use. The following results were seen: 1) 39 percent reported intoxication at the time of injury; and 2) a greater rate of exposure to or recent abuse of substances was seen in those who reported intoxication at the time of injury. It is suggested that intoxication at the time of spinal cord injury may be a marker of preinjury substance use. The following conclusions are drawn: 1) it is important to screen for substance abuse in patients with spinal cord injuries; and 2) timely assessment of and intervention for substance abuse may help improvement treatment and rehabilitation outcomes. 24 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>ADA Bill Passes with Anti-bias Protection For Recovered Alcoholics, Addicts Intact</B><BR>
The Alcoholism Report, pp 3-5., July 1990<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article reviews the Americans with Disabilities Act bill with an emphasis on the provisions affecting alcoholics and addicts.  The bill protects only those individuals who are recovering alcoholics or drug addicts; those applicants or employees who are currently using drugs are excluded from protection.  The Legal Action Center and the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence hailed the final bill's protections for alcoholics and recovered addicts, but expressed concern that current addicts were not included.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1>How Getting High Can Get You AIDS</H1>
<HR>


<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "get1.gif">

<H4>Getting High Makes You Forget.</H4>

<P>Being a teen is exciting.  Being a teen in a world with drugs, sex, and AIDS, is hard.</P>

<P>You might not know all the ways drugs and AIDS are connected.</P>

<P>This booklet will help you understand the dangers and how to avoid them.  Drugs, like alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine can cloud your judgment, make it hard to know right from wrong, distract you from reality.</P>


<H4>Drugs Make You Forget What's Important...</H4>

<P>so you care less about yourself or your friends, because, you just don't care.</P>

<H4>You Forget You're Only Human.</H4>

<P>When you get high you may mistakenly believe nothing bad could happen to you.</P>

<H4>Drugs Can Make You Do Things You May Wish You Never Did, Like:</H4>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "get2.gif">
<P>
<UL>
<LI>act reckless and foolish
<LI>get romantic with someone you don't really like
<LI>have sex without planning
<LI>have sex without thinking of the consequences
<LI>forget to use a condom or forget to have your partner use a condom.
</UL>
<P>
<H4>When Drugs Make You Forget, You May Take Risks, Like Having Sex.</H4>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "get3.gif">
<P>Teen years are a time of making all kinds of new decisions.  One of those decisions is when to have sex.  It's important to make that decision with a clear head because sex today is far riskier than ever before.  Drugs, like alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine can get in the way of making clear decisions.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H4>Why Is Sex Risky?  It Can Lead to AIDS.</H4>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC = "get4.gif">
<UL>
<LI>Unprotected sex with an infected partner is the most common way HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is spread.  Another way is sharing needles to inject drugs.</P>
<P>
<LI>Your sex partner may have had sex with someone who shared a needle to inject drugs with an HIV infected person.
<P>
<LI>The more sex partners you have, the more chance you have of getting AIDS.
<P>
<LI>Two sure ways to avoid the AIDS virus are:  not having sex and not sharing needles.
<P>
<LI>If you choose to have sex, always use a condom to help reduce the risk of getting AIDS.
</UL>

<H4>Make Your Decision About Sex With a Clear Head, Without Drugs.</H4>

<P>Sometimes you can feel pressured to have sex when you may not want to, and drugs make it harder to say no.  Pressure about sex can be hard to deal with -- it can come from your boyfriend or girlfriend, from the crowd you hang out with , or even from your own feelings.</P>

<P>The first thing to remember is you're charge of your body and what you choose to do with it.</P>

<P>The second thing to remember is there is a lot at stake -- a decision about sex can have consequences that last a lifetime.</P>

<H4>It helps to Make a Plan and Stick to it.</H4>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC = "get5.gif">
<P>Then if someone offers you drugs or suggested sex, you'll know what to do.  Plan not to use drugs so you can keep a clear head.  Plan how to say no, to be careful, and to think about what to do.  The time to make your plan is when you have a clear head.</P>

<H4>Making Your Plan.</H4>

<P>Think about who you are and what's important to you, think about how using drugs and having sex could affect that.  When you have a plan it's easier to handle situations where you want to have fun with friends but don't want to use drugs or have sex.</P>

<P>If someone pressures you about drugs you can say nicely but firmly, "I'm not interested," or, "I don't use drugs."</P>

<P>If someone pressures you about sex you could let them know where you stand by saying:  I'm not ready for it yet," or, "Maybe it feels right for you, but it's not for me."</P>

<H4>It's a Fact.</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Teens who use condoms during sex tend to use them less if they've been drinking or smoking dope.
<P>
<LI>More than 20 percent of the people who have AIDS are in their 20's.  Since it can take up to 10 years or more for symptoms to start, many got infected in their teens.
<P>
<LI>The number of reported AIDS cases among teenagers increased 96% between 1988 and 1990.
</UL>
<P>

<H4>You May Already Know This But...</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>YOU CAN'T GET AIDS from hugging, holding hands, mosquitoes or bugs.
<P>
<LI>YOU CAN GET AIDS from unprotected sexual contact.
<P>
<LI>HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
<P>
<LI>You cannot tell someone has the HIV virus by looking at them.  A blood test is the only way to be sure.
<P>
<LI>AIDS is fatal.

<P><EM>These [study] findings suggest a direct association between alcohol and other drug use and unsafe sexual behavior.  Eighth Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health (Secretary of Health and Human Services, October 1993).</EM></P>

<P>Alcohol and other drug use is linked to risky sexual behavior and poses significant threats to the health of adolescents.  Substance abuse may impair adolescents' ability to make judgments about sex and contraception, placing them at increased risk for unplanned pregnancy, sexual assault, or becoming infected with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV/AIDS.</P>

<P>We know the AIDS virus can be transmitted through sharing hypodermic needles.  Less is known about the dangerous role of alcohol and other drugs in sexual behavior that may lead to STDs and HIV/AIDS.  To compound matters, there is also considerable evidence that alcohol and other drugs weaken the immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to infection and disease.</P>

<P>Consider the following statistics:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The use of alcohol and other drugs can affect judgment and lead to taking serious sexual risks.  There were 18,540 cases of AIDS among 13- to 24-year-olds reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the end of 1994.[1]
<P>
<LI>About 75 percent of high school seniors have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lives; about 20 percent have had more than four sexual partners by their senior year.[2]
<P>
<LI>Studies show that adolescents are less likely to use condoms when having sex after drinking alcohol than when sober.  This places them at even higher risk for HIV infection, STDs, and unwanted pregnancy.[3]
<P>
<LI>A survey of high school students found that 18 percent of females and 39 percent of males say it is acceptable for a boy to force sex if the girl is stoned or drunk.[4]
<P>
<LI>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV/AIDS has been the sixth leading cause of death among 15- to 20-year-olds in the United States for over three years.  One in five of the new AIDS cases diagnosed is in the 20 to 29 year age group, meaning that HIV transmission occurred during the teen years.  Additionally, more than half of new cases of HIV infection in 1994 were related to drug use.[2]
</UL>
<P>There is still much to be learned about the relationship between alcohol and other drugs and sexual behavior.  During the past decade, teens reported higher levels of sexual activity at earlier ages, experienced more unplanned pregnancies, and suffered higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases.  To reduce the  incidence of these problems in the future, prevention of alcohol and other drug abuse must be a top priority.  </P>

<P>The progression of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic during the past decade has elicited increased public concern about factors that contribute to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.  Use of alcohol and other drugs is often thought to impair rational judgment and decrease behavioral inhibitions (Critchlow 1986; Leigh 1990c; Reinarman and Leigh 1987).  Some substances are widely believed to enhance the enjoyment of sexual encounters and encourage promiscuous behavior (Leigh 1990a).  As Critchlow (1983) noted, alcohol is often used as an excuse for engaging in behavior that violates social norms.  A better understanding of the relationship between alcohol use and sexual behavior could provide invaluable information for policymakers and program planners.  Empirical work on this issue is in its infancy (Leigh 1990c).</P>

<P>The emergence of AIDS among male homosexuals and intravenous drug users directed the focus of earlier research on these populations.  Several studies found relatively strong associations between substance use (alcohol and recreational drugs) and high-risk sexual behavior among homosexual males (Siegal et al. 1989; Stall 1988; Stall et al. 1986; Valdiserri et al. 1988).  In a longitudinal study of homosexually active men, McCusker et al. (1990) found that men who increased their alcohol use during the study period were about twice as likely as those who reduced their alcohol consumption to maintain high-risk sexual practices.</P>

<P>Research has begun to focus on the relationship between alcohol and other drug use and high-risk sexual behavior among heterosexuals.  To date, the empirical findings remain somewhat equivocal.  Ericksen and Trocki (1992) reported that measures of problem drinking behavior were strongly predictive of self-reported sexually transmitted disease.  They also reported that high-volume drinking was predictive of a high rate of change in sex partners, which in turn increases the risk of sexually transmitted disease.  Temple and Leigh (1992) found that alcohol tended to be associated with encounters involving new sexual partners, but that alcohol use in the event was not predictive of risky sexual behavior.</P>

<P>Noting the long incubation period for AIDS and citing recent statistics on the high incidence of AIDS among individuals between 20 and 29 years of age, Hingson et al. (1990) concluded that many in this age cohort probably were infected as teenagers.  Accordingly, these investigators used telephone interviews to collect information on sexual beliefs and practices from a randomly selected sample of Massachusetts teenagers (n=1,773).  Information on alcohol and drug use was also collected.  The results indicated that drug and alcohol use was associated with unsafe sexual practices.  Heavy drinkers (those consuming five or more drinks in a day) were about 2.8 times less likely to report regular condom use than nondrinkers.  Respondents who said they had used marijuana during the past month were about 1.9 times less likely than others to use condoms.</P>

<P>To more directly examine the influence of alcohol and other drug use on risky sexual behavior, the investigators asked teenagers about condom use in sexual encounters that occurred immediately after drinking or marijuana use (Hingson et al. 1990).  Approximately 16 percent of those sampled said they were less likely to use condoms in sexual encounters that immediately followed drinking.  Use of marijuana before sex was associated with a 25-percent reduction in reported condom use.  These findings suggest a direct association between alcohol and other drug use and unsafe sexual behavior.  Similar results were reported in a more recent survey (Strunin and Hingson 1992).</P>

<P>In a study of San Francisco-area households, Leigh (1990b) constructed a weighed index of high-risk sexual behavior based on public health guidelines.  She reported a strong bivariate relationship between the self-reported frequency of sexual encounters while under the influence of alcohol and risk of AIDS.  Multivariate analysis indicated that the interpretation of this association is not straightforward.  The observed relationship between alcohol use and risk of AIDS tended to disappear after controlling for the total amount of sexual activity.  The best predictor of high-risk sexual behavior was not alcohol or drug use in sexual encounters, but the reported overall frequency of sex.  Further analysis indicated that drinking or drug use by the respondent's partner may be associated with high-risk sexual behavior.  Leigh (1990b) cautioned that this association could be an artifact of the high correlation between respondents' and partners' drinking.  Another methodological caveat about correlational studies is that some third factor, such as personality characteristics, may account for the bivariate correlation between alcohol use and high-risk sexual behavior.</P>

<P>Empirical research, using samples representing homosexual and heterosexual populations, has established an association between alcohol use, drug use, and high-risk sexual behavior, but underlying processes and mechanisms that explain this relationship have not been definitively identified.  A limitation of several early studies was that overall measures of alcohol and drug use were correlated with overall measures of high-risk sexual activity.  Such an approach provides comparatively weak evidence of a direct link between alcohol use during sexual encounters and high-risk sexual behavior.</P>

<P>In a longitudinal study of homosexually active men, McCusker et al. found that men who increased their alcohol use during the study period were about twice as likely as those who reduced their alcohol consumption to maintain high-risk sexual practices.</P>

<P>Recent studies directly link substance abuse and sexual behavior by examining drug and alcohol use during sexual encounters.  Evidence strongly suggests that alcohol contributes to behavior that increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.</P>

<P>Ongoing work indicates that the relationship between alcohol and other drug use and behavior is more complex than was initially anticipated.  Earleywine and Finn (1991) found that people who score high on general measures of sensation-seeking were more likely to consume alcohol and to express behavioral disinhibition.  Other sociological or psychological attributes may also help explain the relationship between alcohol and other drug use and sexual behavior.</P>

<P>Alcohol and other drugs (AOD) are associated with all sorts of injuries, ranging from the highly publicized  drinking and driving crashes to the less discussed falls, drownings, and suicides.  We at CSAP have compiled this resource guide to call attention to these unfortunate consequences of AOD. </P>

<P>Prevention specialists, criminal justice professionals, and community leaders will find dozens of resources in this guide to help them create safer homes, neighborhoods, workplaces, and recreational areas.  Working together we can cut the number of avoidable injuries substantially and protect our children, teenagers, and families from the dangers associated with AOD.</P>

<B>Illicit Drugs Take Still Another Toll ¾ Death or Injury from Vehicle-Associated Trauma</B><BR>
<I>JAMA:  Journal of the American Medical Association </I>263(23):3122, 3125, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each year approximately 46,000 people die on U.S.  highways and 300,000 to 500,000 more suffer serious injuries.  While studies have shown that alcohol plays a significant role in at least 60 percent of these traumas, there are few data to show how much the use of marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, and other illicit drugs adds to the toll.  This article cites recent data from theNational Study Center for Trauma and Emergency Medical Services showing that 7.1 percent of injured drivers admitted to the institute tested positive for cocaine, and 4 percent tested positive for phencyclidine.  Among motorcycle drivers, 10 percent had tested positive for cocaine and 10 percent were positive for phencyclidine.  The article points to the need for further investigation of the role of drugs, other than alcohol, in the causation or trauma experienced in vehicle injuries.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Schatz, I.; Schember, C.; Parsons, J.; Rodriguez, J.; Young, C.; and Holder, H.D.</I></B><BR>
In:  <I>Experiences With Community Action Projects:  New Research in the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems, CSAP Prevention Monograph-14,</I> T. K. Greenfield, R. Zimmerman, Eds., pp. 138-145. Rockville, MD:  Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1993<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD  20847-2345. Inventory Code:  BKD87.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prevention Research Center (PRC) is implementing a 5-year community prevention trial to reduce alcohol-involved unintentional injuries and fatalities¾resulting from traffic collisions, falls, drownings, and burns¾through the application of environmental strategies (Holder and Saltz 1988).  Five interacting and supporting components provide the framework for the set of comprehensive community-based interventions developed for this project.  These five components are the following:  (1) community knowledge, values, and mobilization; (2) responsible beverage service; (3) reduction of underage drinking; (4) risk of drinking and driving; and (5) access to alcohol.  This report provides information on the role of the coalition, structures to provide real community input, benefits and advantages of research-oriented projects, disadvantages and deterrents of research-driven projects, contributions to the project only the community can make, political realities that must be addressed, and working with multicultural groups.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report looks at the Rhode Island Community Alcohol Abuse/Injury Prevention Project (RICAAIPP), an epidemiologic research project with a prevention intervention component.  The project's goals were to establish a model/demonstration project to conduct an indepth epidemiologic study of selected risk factors for adverse, health-related outcomes of alcohol use in each of two communities in a State.  The alcohol-related health outcomes to be influenced were confined to injuries, specifically assault injuries and motor vehicle crash injuries.  Results showed increases in intervention community arrest rates, as a result of increased police enforcement.  There also were decreases in intervention community emergency room injury rates, especially assault and motor vehicle crash injury rates, along with decreased head injury visit rates, which were probable program effects.  The report concludes that injury reduction can be accomplished through primary and secondary prevention related to server training and police training, technical assistance, and enforcement programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Position Papers from the Third National Injury Control Conference:  Setting the National Agenda for Injury Control in the 1990s</B><BR>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>The concern and interest of the American public, policy makers, and public health professionals have increasingly focused on the problem of injury, including the high number of deaths and disabilities and the enormous costs, both human and financial, to our country.  As part of this increased focus, the Committee on Trauma Research and the Institute of Medicine, in the Injury in America report, and subsequently, the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control called for a national plan to control injuries.  As the first step in developing such a plan, the National Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have spent more than a year facilitating the development of the position papers in this book.  The plan will help shape the future of injury control research, programs, and policies for this decade.  The seven position papers serve to (a) define the field of injury control; (b) assess the current status of injury control research and programs; (c) help CDC, other Federal agencies, and nongovernmental organizations clearly define directions and priorities in a coordinated way; (d) identify what interventions should be evaluated and disseminated; (e) plan for the development of injury control program capacity in State and local health departments and other agencies; and (f) identify organizations and opportunities for carrying out various research and programmatic recommendations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report provides the results of three surveys presented to the U.S. Surgeon General on youth and alcohol.  The first survey, Youth and Alcohol:  A National Survey.  Drinking Habits, Access, Attitudes, and Knowledge, surveyed junior and senior high school students (grades 7 to 12) to determine how they obtain, view, and consume alcohol.  The second survey, Youth and Alcohol:  A National Survey.  Do They Know What They're Drinking?, surveyed the same age group to determine their knowledge about alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  The third survey, Youth and Alcohol:  Laws and Enforcement.  Is the 21-Year-Old Drinking Age a Myth?, examined current State laws and regulations governing youth access to alcohol and how these laws are enforced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examined the effect of legal drinking age (LDA) on fatal injuries in persons ages 15 to 24 years in the United States between 1979 and 1984.  Effects on pre-LDA teens, adolescents targeted by LDA, initiation at LDA, and post-LDA drinking experience were assessed.  A higher LDA was also associated with reduced death rates for motor vehicle drivers, pedestrians, unintentional injuries excluding motor vehicle injuries, and suicide.  An initiation effect on homicides was identified.  Reductions in injury deaths related to drinking experience were not found.  In general, a higher LDA reduced deaths among adolescents and young adults for various categories of violent death.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study investigates the prevalence of excessive drinking and alcohol-related problems among suicide attempts.  It also compares the characteristics of attempted suicide by alcohol consumption groups.  Drinking histories were taken on 250 consecutive attempted suicides admitted to the West Midlands Poison Unit.  Fifty-one percent of the men and 31 percent of the women drank more than the weekly limits recommended by the Health Education Council.  Of the men, 22.5 percent drank more than 50 units of alcohol a week, and 9.5 percent of the women drank more than 35 units of alcohol a week.  Alcohol-related problems (social problems, alcohol dependence, or physical illness) were present in 34 percent of men and 15.5 percent of women.  These results show a greater incidence of alcohol misuse than previous studies on attempted suicide.  This is probably because detailed alcohol histories were taken on all patients.  Alcohol misuse is best treated before major alcohol-related problems develop.  Those responsible for assessing cases of attempted suicide should be adept at detecting alcohol misuse and instituting appropriate management.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Millions of U.S.  children are exposed to parents who are problem drinkers, yet there is little evidence about the effect of parental alcohol consumption on children's health.  The aim of this study was to assess the association between children's injuries and parental drinking.  Data for this study was collected through a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population by household interview.  The participants were 12,360 children and parents from single-family households, with data from the Alcohol and Child Health supplements to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey.  Serious injuries ¾ injuries resulting in hospitalization, surgical treatment, any time missed from school, or one half day or more in bed ¾ were used as the major outcome for this study.  Children of mothers categorized as problem drinkers had 2.1 times the risk of serious injury as children of mothers who were nondrinkers (95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.5).  Other measures of mothers' alcohol consumption (i.e., average, maximum, and self-rated consumption) were unrelated to child injuries, as were all measures of fathers' drinking.  Children of women who were problem drinkers married to men rated as moderate or heavy drinkers had a relative risk of serious injury of 2.7 (95 percent CI, 0.8 to 8.6) compared with children of nondrinkers.  Children of women who are problem drinkers have an elevated injury risk; children with two parents who are problem drinkers are at higher risk.  Further research is needed on potential mechanisms and interventions.  Primary prevention might be enhanced if physicians elicited information about parental drinking, helped secure appropriate treatment, and participated in public health efforts to reduce the deleterious effects of alcohol.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Position Papers from the Third National Injury Control Conference:  Setting the National Agenda for Injury Control in the 1990s. Prevention of Violence and Injuries Due to Violence</B><BR>
Conference Paper, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health and Injury Control, Division of Injury Control, Denver, CO, April 22 - 25, 1991. pp. 161-254
<BLOCKQUOTE>An agenda is presented for reducing injuries and death due to interpersonal violence and suicidal behavior.  The dimensions of the health problem due to self-directed and interpersonal violence are reviewed.  The complexity of the etiology of injuries due to violence is discussed.  The potential for progress, through the application of public health perspectives and principles, to the prevention of intentional injuries is examined.  There is a need for a coordinated approach and structure for planning and implementing a comprehensive violence prevention effort.  Four areas of emphasis are discussed:  (1) injuries from firearm violence; (2) alcohol and other drug use and violence; (3) early childhood experiences that affect the risk of future violent behavior or victimization; and (4) treatable mental disorders associated with an increased risk of suicide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Homicide:  Drinking by the Victim<BR>
<I>Welte, J.W., and Abel, E.L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>50(3):197-201, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>A comparison was made between homicides in which the victim had either been drinking or had not been drinking.  Medical examiner records for 792 homicides in Erie County, New York from 1972 through 1984 were used.  A logistic regression found that in a significantly higher proportion of certain types of homicides there was alcohol in the victim's blood:  male victims, victims ages 30-49, homicides that occur in the warmer months and in the evening or at night, homicides not related to another crime, stabbings, and homicides that take place in bars and restaurants.  Some circumstances associated with a very high likelihood of alcohol in the victim's blood were:  men killed at night, men killed by women, African-American male victims, and all killings on Saturday or Sunday nights.  These results suggest that a high likelihood of alcohol in victims is associated with circumstances that make drinking more likely (e.g., male victims, homicide at night), but also alcohol is more likely to be present in homicides that arise spontaneously from personal disputes.  It was also found that there is a higher likelihood of alcohol in the victim for homicides that occur during time periods when there are more homicides.  It is suggested that in some cases the alcohol may be a causal factor in the homicide.  10 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847-2345.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alcohol use may play an important causal role in homicide.  However, information characterizing the association between alcohol use and homicide victimization within specific racial/ethnic groups is limited.  To characterize the relationship, data from the Los Angeles City Police Department and the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's Office were used to study victims of criminal homicides in Los Angeles during the period 1970-1979.  Alcohol was detected in the blood of 1,733 (49 percent) of the 3,551 victims ages 15 to 64 who were tested.  In 32 percent of those cases tested, the blood alcohol level was equal to or more than 100 mg/100 ml, the level of legal intoxication in most States.  Blood alcohol was present in 39 percent of Whites, 49 percent of Blacks, and 59 percent of Hispanic victims of homicide.  The presence of blood alcohol among racial and ethnic groups also differed, according to situational variables, including the day of the week the homicide occurred and the relationship between the victim and the offender.  These variations emphasize the need to examine situational, socioeconomic, and cultural factors in explaining racial and ethnic differences in alcohol use patterns among homicide victims.  44 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol and Injuries:  Problems and Responses</B><BR>
<I>Prevention File </I>7(5):2-5, 1992
<BLOCKQUOTE>Injuries cause about 150,000 deaths per year in the United States.  About one-third are from motor vehicle or traffic related injuries, one-third are from intentional injuries, such as homicide and suicide, and one-third are from other unintentional injuries.  For each death, there are hundreds of injuries requiring medical attention.  This article looks at the correlation between alcohol and injuries and states that alcohol is associated with a substantial percentage of car crashes, falls, fires, occupational deaths, assaults, rapes, and attempted suicides.  Several injury prevention proposals are suggested, including strategic ideas, criminal justice recommendations, and policy changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Violence and Homicide:  Another Facet of Substance Abuse <BR>

In:  <I>Proceedings of a National Conference on Preventing Alcohol and Drug Abuse in Black Communities, </I>pp. 111-125. Washington, DC, May 22-24, 1990. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article considers violence and homicide as another facet of substance abuse looked at from an Afrocentric view of the world.  In the past, African American people came together to solve their problems collectively, but because this problem-solving technique has been abandoned, African Americans are now experiencing even more problems.  The authors believe that the African-American people need to go back to collectively helping themselves and not depend on the Federal Government or anyone else.  The theme discussed is:  Crime is not part of our African-American heritage.  African-American people are not criminals by tradition, but 10 percent of the people in the African-American community commit 100 percent of the crime.  Traditionally, the African-American community is very religious and hard-working, having to work harder in order to come from slavery to dignity.  In the program described here, successful African-American males who represent positive role models are put in the high-crime areas to share their experiences.  (Programmers also take hard-working men that have dirt under their fingernails back to work with young males.)  These are positive role models that are needed in the African-American communities.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Workplace Drug Abuse Leads to Injuries and Other Job Problems</B><BR>
<I>Narcotics Demand Reduction Digest, </I>December 1990, pp. 7-8
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article reports that while employees who tested positive for marijuana or cocaine use had higher rates of injury in the workplace, the problems may not be as great as previously believed.  A study of 2,537 applicants for postal workers' jobs showed that those who tested positive for marijuana had 55 percent more accidents, 85 percent more injuries, and 56 percent more turnover.  Those who tested positive for cocaine had 59 percent more accidents, 85 percent more injuries, and 15 percent more turnover.  A brief overview of literature discussing the prediction of outcome from drug screening is included.  The study lacked information about the relationship of alcohol use to job injuries and accidents.  Several statistics about accidents, absenteeism, injury, and turnover are cited, compared, and discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adolescent Suicide and Drugs <BR>
<I>Gold, M.S.</I></B><BR>
<I>Addiction and Recovery, </I>March/April 1991, p. 15
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author notes that one-third of all suicide victims have a history of substance abuse, and that the percentage is higher among teenage suicides.  The author contends that many of the fatal, alcohol-related automobile crashes and deaths caused by drowning, fire, and homicide are actually teenage suicides.  Alcohol-related crashes are the leading killer of youths ages 15 to 24 and about half of the other deaths are alcohol- or other drug-related.  The author explains that youth often view substance use as a way of being accepted when, in reality, alcohol and drugs increase a sense of isolation.  Statistics about teenage use are cited from a Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) survey.  Strategies to lower the risk of suicide and drug use are described via PRIDE surveys taken before and after a media campaign.  Exposure to anti-drug messages consistently affected people's attitudes in a year, with the greatest change in college students.  A prevention program implemented by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in a Kansas City high school also had a great impact on teenage drug use.  The author suggests that suicide prevention programs take the same tactics of educating and helping youth in avoiding negative outcomes.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Alcohol-Related Relative Risk of Fatal Driver Injuries in Relation to Driver Age and Sex<BR>

(Available from Paul L. Zador, Ph.D., Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 1005 North Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22201.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The relative risks of fatal crash involvement at various blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were examined using data on fatal driver injuries from the Fatal Accident Reporting System in conjunction with driver exposure data from the second national roadside breath-testing survey.  Based on driver fatalities in single-vehicle crashes, it was estimated that each 0.02 percentage increase in the BAC of a driver with non-zero BAC nearly doubles the risk of being in a fatal crash.  Crash risk was found to increase with increasing BAC among all of the six age and sex groups studied.  At BACs in the 0.05-0.09 percent range, the likelihood of a crash was at least nine times greater than at zero BAC for all age groups.  Younger drivers with BACs in the 0.05-0.09 range had higher relative risks than older drivers, and females had higher relative risks than males.  At very high BACs (at or above 0.15 percent), the risk of crashing was 300 to 600 times the risk at zero or near-zero BACs.  These relative risk estimates are considerably higher than estimated in other studies, but other studies have based their estimates on all crashes rather than single-vehicle crashes only.  In this study, relative risks were also lower when based on driver fatalities in all crashes.  However, when plausible assumptions were made about the BAC distributions of other participants in multiple-vehicle crashes (whose actual BAC is often unknown), the relative risks based on the maximum BAC of the crash participants were nearly as high as those estimated in single-vehicle crashes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite the roles that medicine and criminal justice play in responding to alcohol-related injuries, they cannot solve the problem of isolation.  Reducing the toll of mortality and morbidity is classically a public health problem, requiring a multidisciplinary solution.  Prevention must rely upon a comprehensive array of interventions, drawing upon legislation and enforcement, education and behavior change, and engineering and environmental approaches.  Necessarily, a reduction must be made in alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and in annual alcohol consumption to reduce the injury caused by drunk drivers.  Many approaches to alcohol-related problems are based upon a theory of availability, which is grounded in an understanding that alcohol is a risk factor for many health problems.  Changes in consumption of alcohol will be accompanied by a change in the prevalence of mortality and morbidity.  Therefore, measures designed to affect overall consumption will have a broad, preventive effect.  Many of these interventions are described, including minimum drinking age laws, alcohol excise tax increases, and dram shop laws.  These are the most promising since they are designed to broadly affect consumption.  113 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Alcohol, Tobacco & Other Drug Studies, UCSD Extension, 0176, University of California - San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0176.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>More Americans die from alcohol-related injuries in falls, fires, drownings, shootings, and cases of child abuse, battering, rape, and suicide, than in alcohol-related traffic crashes.  Approximately 23,830 alcohol-related trauma deaths annually have causes other than motor vehicle crashes.  Alcohol involvement in trauma cases is hard to measure, however, and therefore often is overlooked.  Policies vary from one emergency room to another on whether patients are tested for alcohol.  Evidence from a number of studies does exist to support the enormity of this problem.  Some of these study results include:  heavy drinking doubles the risk of fatal injury; 41 percent of deaths resulting from unintentional falls in a Minnesota study involved alcohol; a Maryland study found that alcohol was involved in 47 percent of drownings of persons ages 15 and older; Maryland researchers studying 398 fatal fires found that 40 percent of fire victims had positive blood alcohol concentrations and 85 percent were legally intoxicated; a study in upstate New York reported positive blood alcohol concentrations in 33 percent of persons committing suicide, which suggests that alcohol contributes to impulsive suicides; at a trauma center in Orange County, California, 52 percent of the people injured in fights and 49 percent of those treated for stab wounds had positive blood alcohol concentrations; one study found that more than half of convicted rapists had been drinking at the time of their offense; and there is ample evidence to suggest that alcohol is a significant factor in cases of battering.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Political Approaches to Injury Control at the State Level<BR>
<I>Bergman, A.B. (Ed.)</I></B><BR>
Seattle, WA:  University of Washington Press, 1992, 113 p.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Injuries destroy the health, lives, and livelihoods of millions of people, yet they receive little attention, compared with diseases and other hazards.  Many approaches to control this modern epidemic have been employed, but none have been as efficient or effective as legislation and regulation.  In the traffic safety field, for example, countless lives have been saved by laws mandating the safer design of cars and highways, wearing of seat belts, and swift and certain punishment of drunk drivers.  A diverse group of experts from the fields of law, medicine, insurance, and State government discuss:  (1) defining the most significant injury problems (in terms of morbidity and mortality) amenable to approach through legislation, regulation, and or legal means at the State level, and (2) developing practical implementation strategies and useful data that could be employed at the State level.  Among the legislative issues explored are:  drunk driving; compulsory motorcycle helmets; alcohol taxes and advertising; burn prevention; drowning; and handgun control.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Role of Alcohol in Nonfatal Bicycle Injuries<BR>
<I>Olkkonen, S., and Honkanen, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Accident Analysis and Prevention </I>22(1):89-96, 1990
<BLOCKQUOTE>To assess the risk of nonfatal bicycle injury related to blood alcohol concentration (BAC) an unmatched case-control study was conducted in Helsinki in 1986.  Eligible cases included 140 adults injured either in motor vehicle or other bicycle crashes that occurred between 3 p.m.  and 10 p.m., who arrived at the hospital within 6 hours of injury.  Seven hundred bicyclists from the street were randomly selected as controls.  BAC was measured with a breathalyzer.  A major difference in alcohol involvement was found between cases (24.1 percent) and control (4.0 percent).  The injury risk estimate (odds ratio) of an inebriated bicyclist was at least 10-fold at BACs above 100 mg/dl compared to a sober bicyclist.  Alcohol increased the bicyclist's risk of injury from falling more than from collision.  As an unprotected road user, an inebriated bicyclist greatly increases personal risk of injury but seldom causes danger to other road users.  28 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There is little question that consumption of alcohol impairs human performance on many tasks and increases the risk of unintentional injury.  The evidence also is clear that drinking increases the chances for interpersonal violence and intentional injury.  Recent literature is reviewed on the rate of involvement of alcohol in diverse injury situations.  Strategies are identified for preventing injuries derived from the field of injury control.  Injury prevention strategies also are identified from the field of criminal justice.  Recent research on selected strategies for preventing injuries from the field of alcohol control are reviewed.  35 Ref.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If reductions in excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injuries and deaths are desired, an increase in Federal excise tax rates on alcoholic beverages is an effective policy to accomplish this goal.  To justify an excise tax hike of a particular magnitude two things must be considered:  (1) the welfare costs imposed on all segments of the population by excise tax hikes and (2) the costs and benefits of excise tax hikes compared to alternative policies, such as those that increase the probability of punishment for drunken driving and the fine for this offense.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>From the Acting Director of CSAP...</H3>
<P><B>Faith and religion play an enormous role in the lives of many individuals.  This reality gives leaders of faith communities a unique and wonderful opportunity to reach and help many people in their congregations and neighborhoods.  One of the most crucial concerns affecting Americans today unfortunately, is alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) problems. </P>
<P> I hope the resources contained in this guide will help members and leaders of faith communities across the country reduce the problems of ATOD abuse.</P>

<I>Monteiro, M.G., and Schuckit, M.A.</I></B><BR>
<I>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</I> 15(4):403-412, 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Data from a questionnaire sent to 704 male university students and nonacademic staff were re-analyzed to compare self-reports of drug and alcohol intake patterns and problems as well as family histories of psychiatric disorders for Jewish (N=110, Group 1) and Christian men (N=594, Group 2). Although the two groups did not differ significantly on the quantity and frequency of alcohol intake, men in Group 2 were more likely to report at least one episode of heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems, and their responses indicated a higher rate of a family history of alcoholism.  There were no differences across the groups on the proportion of lifetime drug use and related difficulties, or on the family histories of other psychiatric disorders.  The results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating a lower prevalence of heavy drinking and related problems among Jews.  44 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

While the existence of an inverse religiosity-substance use relationship is well documented, questions still exist concerning the nature of these relationships.  A review of the literature reveals three rival hypotheses concerning variation in the strength of these relationships across drug types:  the Anti-Asceticism hypothesis, which predicts stronger relationships among the &quot;softer&quot; drug types; the moral condemnated hypothesis which predicts stronger relationships among the &quot;harder&quot; drugs; and the Hellfire hypothesis, which predicts stable effects across drug types. These data provide strong support for the more general Hellfire hypothesis, with equivalent parameter estimates for the effects of religiosity observed for each drug type.  However, slightly weaker effects are observed for adolescent use of alcohol.  29 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This study is a secondary analysis of data gathered under the sponsorship of the Utah State Division of Alcoholism and Drugs in 1989.  The researchers concluded that there is a difference in frequency of alcohol use, source of alcohol, and age of first alcohol use among Latter Day Saints (LDS), Other Religions and No Religions subgroups.  There is no significant difference found among the various religious subgroups for age of first marijuana use and quantity of alcohol use.  For all religions except Jewish, a lower percentage of Utahns used alcohol than their national counterparts.  A theoretical model for LDS drug use is presented.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This panel discussion addressed the role in which the family, specifically parents, and the church can play in the prevention of alcohol and other drug use among Black youth. Participants discussed programs developed by parent groups and congregations, and highlighted successes that have resulted.  PARADE--Parents Rally Against the Drug Epidemic¾is one such Washington, DC, based parents' organization which has brought concerned parents together in hopes of eradicating drug use in their neighborhoods.  The Neighborhood Action Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention, based in Baltimore, is another parent-run organization which, in its 3-year existence, cut the number of community delinquencies from 113 children to 53 children.  Participants stressed the significant role the church has played and can continue to play in this prevention effort for its African American youth.  The Black church serves as a powerful voice in social, religious, advocacy, and spiritual circles.  Influential clergy can serve as organizers for various causes, and the church can sponsor prevention, intervention, and treatment programs for its at  risk and addicted population.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Men born in India but living in Britain have higher than expected treatment rates for alcohol-related disorders.  A community survey of random samples of 200 each of Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim men and 200 White English-born men, matched for age, were interviewed using a structural questionnaire containing a retrospective drinking diary. Sikhs were most likely to be regular drinkers, followed by Whites and Hindus.  The very few Muslim men who drank consumed the most alcohol on average.  The frequently reported pattern of an inverse relationship between drinking and age was found for White men but not among Sikhs and Hindus.  In both these groups older men reported consuming more alcohol than younger men.  However, age was confounded with generation:  heavier levels of consumption were reported by Sikhs and Hindus born in India than by Sikhs and Hindus born in Britain.  Among regular drinkers Sikhs had higher average Alcohol Problem Scale Scores than did White men or Hindus.  The highest average scores were recorded for the (few) Muslim regular drinkers (who also consumed the most alcohol).  A clear association with religious observance was found for all three Asian groups and for the White men.  No actively practicing Muslims drank at all, and a relatively small proportion of the other groups who were regular church/temple/mosque attenders drank regularly.  15 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The rate of alcohol and other drug abuse (AOD) among Jews is near that of the general population. Contrary to the myth that being Jewish bestows immunity to addictions, AOD abuse is an issue among every segment of the population. This not only encompasses all age groups, but also affects those who maintain various levels of religious observation. Jewish youth are statistically among the most vulnerable to middle class drug abuse (with alcohol as the most popular drug). Jewish families tend to emphasize high achievement and excellence which may result in denial that teens use alcohol or other drugs. Parents may inadvertently encourage alcohol consumption because they fear exposure to illegal drugs. In addition, there are special problems for observant Jews who are alcoholics in that non-Jewish treatment facilities often seem unfamiliar and unfriendly settings and do not provide kosher food.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>No Hiding Place:  Empowerment and Recovery for Our Troubled Communities<BR>
<I>Williams, C.</I></B><BR>
New York:  Harper Collins Publishers, 1992<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reverend Cecil Williams tells the story of the efforts and successes of his Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco.  Seeking to improve the drug-infested lives of Tenderloin district residents, and decrying the drug trade as an agent of genocide for African Americans, Williams developed an innovative recovery program which shows how Black history and spiritual, religious, and cultural values provide vital tools for resisting and overcoming the slavery of drugs.  The result is a community in recovery where crack addicts are giving up their pipes, where abused women are coming to heal their pain, and abusive men are letting go of their rage.  Williams demonstrates how other communities can model his endeavors, and likewise eradicate the drug trade from their neighborhoods.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Since its original formulation in 1969 by Hirschi and Stark, the Hellfire hypothesis has undergone several significant revisions. This hypothesis asserts that involvement in deviant behavior is inversely related to religiosity. Early revisions of this hypothesis stressed the importance of religiosity on violations of ascetic norms over violations of secular norms. More recent revisions have stressed the interactive effects of religiosity and contextual factors such as denominational norms and aggregate religiosity. Each of these respecifications of the original Hellfire hypothesis is evaluated here with survey data on self-reported alcohol and marijuana use from a sample of 3,065 male and female adolescents in grades 7 through 12 in three midwestern states. Results suggest that most of these revisions are only marginally more useful than the original formulation for explaining adolescent alcohol consumption and are largely irrelevant with regard to marijuana use. We find that the more parsimonious proposition of a direct religiosity effect alone does about as well in explaining alcohol and marijuana use among adolescents as the more complex contextual propositions. 68 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Our Overlooked Resource<BR>
<I>Smith, D.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcoholism and Addiction</I>, November 1989<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This article discusses the role that the clergy can play in education and referral for their congregations. The spiritual aspects of chemical dependency have frequently been dismissed by the lay public as unimportant or even non-existent. However, the clergy have also faced the natural reluctance of parishioners to reveal the existence of substance abuse within their families. Therefore, clergy have been overlooked as a resource in the battle against alcohol and other drug abuse. Currently, perceptions are changing both inside and outside the church and religious and civic leaders have begun to recognize the value of working together to seek solutions to this problem. A survey of 101 clergy found that the majority agreed to help in this area; however, they all requested more information to help them recognize substance abuse problems. The clergy stated that they see the results of substance abuse when ministering to broken families, troubled youth and the homeless. The response of this study provided the framework for the Interfaith Council's first clergy outreach program, a day-long conference titled:  &quot;The Clergy and Substance Abuse:  Ministering to Your Congregation and Community&quot; The program was tailored to meet the needs expressed by the clergy in the study.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Harper Collins Publishers, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY  10022.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The author examines the following issues:  what the clergy need to know about alcoholics and their families; the most common misconceptions about alcoholism; how to distinguish between social drinking and problem drinking; alcoholism as a moral weakness versus alcoholism as a disease; and Alcoholics Anonymous -- its effectiveness and how it works. The author also discusses the key issues facing pastors and church members, including:  identifying alcoholism's progressive symptoms, counseling for alcoholics and family members, treatment programs, intervention, and aftercare. He introduces the idea of a Support Team Ministry within the congregation, a church-connected network that raises awareness through education and that can help provide vital information on treatment programs.

<B>Creating a Safe Place:  Christians Healing from the Hurt of Dysfunctional Families<BR>
<I>Grayson, C., and Johnson, J.</I></B><BR>
San Francisco:  Harper Collins Publishers, 1991<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The classic symptoms of dysfunctional families are examined. Ways in which dysfunction permeates a family and breaks down communication and leaves family members feeling isolated and anxious are illustrated. Dysfunctional families are characterized by three rules of denial:  don't talk, don't trust, and don't feel. This denial often fuels the problem and keeps the cycle going. Ironically, children who grow up in dysfunctional families often repeat the patterns they learned as children, creating an unhealthy cycle. Ways in which Christians can help to heal themselves, breaking free from past problems and finding their inner child, are outlined. Recovery groups and church-sponsored programs are advocated for fostering recovery. Guidelines are presented for fostering recovery and starting a support group for adult children of dysfunctional families.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Lorch, B.R., and Hughes, R.H.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education</I> 33(2):14-26, 1988<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A questionnaire survey was administered to 237 church pastors and leaders in a western city to determine church attitudes and policies concerning alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and the extent and nature of their church alcohol and other drug education programs.  The results indicate that fundamentalist religious groups were the greatest deterrent to youth substance use. The substance use education programs reflect negative attitudes toward alcohol and other drugs and forbid their use.  Religious groups at the liberal end of the fundamentalism-liberalism scale, were the most effective in preventing <I>heavy</I> substance use. Their substance abuse education programs are more accepting of alcohol and other drugs and tend to provide guidelines for their use.  The results appear to indicate that although forbidding young people to use alcohol or other drugs may be a satisfactory deterrent for substance use, having guidelines for use of AOD may help prevent young people from becoming <I>heavy</I> users.  It is suggested that prevention of substance use and abuse could be more successfully achieved by the church if more churches provided substance use education programs.  23 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from UMI, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.  Refer to #DA8828041.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between the Black male adolescent's use of alcohol and (1) his own church involvement, and (2) the church involvement of significant others. The subjects of the investigation were 139 Black male adolescents age 12 to 15 in a southeastern State. All came from families meeting Federal guidelines for low income families, and all claimed membership in or affiliation with the Baptist denomination.  More than half of the subjects (60.5 percent) reported attending church once a week or more and 63.3 percent reported that they never drank alcoholic beverages.  The survey instrument used was a self-report questionnaire (Neal's Alcohol Attitudes Questionnaire) administered to the subjects.  Items were designed to measure the adolescent's alcohol use; father's, mother's, and best friend's church attendance; and attitudes toward religion, father, mother, and alcohol.  The findings were discussed in the light of previous research, including Fishbein's model of behavioral intentions, and were found to be consistent with that research. The importance of the father as a role model for adolescent sons in Black families versus the mother was verified. The findings also indicate that the adolescent's own church attendance influences his/her decision regarding alcohol use more than the church attendance of parents or best friends.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic influences on alcohol consumption are discussed.  The study included a survey of 7,600 persons.  Alcohol dependence was highest among the Buddhists and the Christians, with an incidence of 14 per 1,000 and 10 per 1,000, respectively.  Although Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic faiths all condemn alcohol use, the Buddhist faith alone appears to have had no effect on reducing alcohol abuse and dependence.  While all Hindus and Moslems, including those who consume alcoholic beverages, appear to understand that their religion prohibits the consumption of alcohol, Buddhists who consume alcohol report that alcohol was not prohibited. It is suggested that these differences should be considered when prevention strategies are developed.  3 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This report offers a review of a significant volume of research on alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, and other drug use in conjunction with religious practice. The author describes in detail how the apparent inhibiting role of religion generalizes to multiple, demographic subgroups and across multiple measures of religion and substance use. Attention is given to documenting the strength of the negative relationship between religion and substance use, with religion compared in predictive power to various social and psychological constructs. The author evaluates the research which is aimed at explaining the religion-substance use association, and offers suggestions for guiding further research.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adventist Adolescents and Addiction:  Substance Use/Abuse in an Adventist Population and its Relationship to Religion, Family, Self-Perception, and Deviant Behavior<BR>
<I>Daily, S.G.</I></B><BR>

(Available from UMI, 300 North Zeeb Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.  Refer to #DA9128455.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study was designed to measure the relative impact of four independent variables (religion, family, self-perception, and deviant behavior) on Seventh-day Adventist adolescent substance users. It also analyzed how the Adventist teaching of total abstinence impacts substance use patterns among the church's adolescents, and compared these findings with parallel research conducted with adolescents in six other Protestant denominations, and in the general population. Thirteen thousand eight hundred and eighteen subjects were administered a 465-item questionnaire in carefully controlled group settings. For testing of hypotheses, substance abusers were defined as those who:  smoked tobacco, or drank alcohol more than once a day, used illegal drugs more than once a week, used any of these substances 40 or more times in the last 12 months, or who engaged in binge drinking. As predicted, Adventist adolescents scored significantly lower on reported rates of substance use, and even lower on substance abuse, than adolescents in other Protestant churches. Deviant behavior, religious orientation, family environment, and self-perception all proved to have strong correlations with Adventist adolescent substance use, with religion being even stronger than predicted, and self-perception being weaker than predicted. Contrary to prediction, Hispanic ethnicity was linked to higher reported rates of Adventist adolescent substance use, and geographical location did prove to be a significant factor correlating with varying levels of substance use. Also, contrary to prediction, abstainers scored significantly better than experimenters or moderate users on measures of religion, family, self-perception and deviance. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Report, Andrews University, 1991<BR>
(Available from Andrews University, Institute of Alcoholism and Drug Dependency, Berrien Springs, MI  49104.) <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Five 1990 union-wide conferences were evaluated for conference success and effectiveness of outcomes at the local level.  The most impressive finding on conference success, which was high in each case, is the consistency of the response youth make to the program.  The use of identical feeling words to describe overall attitudes and family group experiences is remarkable.  Participants believed their knowledge about drugs had increased and their readiness to become active at the local level as leaders or members increased 2.5 to 5 times over involvement prior to attending.  Participants also believed they were spiritually enriched in spite of the lack of overt religious format.  Evaluation of local club activity 2 to 4 months post-conference in a sample of academies showed that two-thirds of the schools had good to excellent functioning clubs with a wide range of activity.  This suggests that the conferences not only motivate and encourage commitment, but have a continued impact on youth leadership and prevention involvement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Use and Correlates among Adult Seventh-Day Adventists in North America</B><BR>

Report, Andrews University, 1989<BR>
(Available from Andrews University, Institute of Alcoholism and Drug Dependency, Berrien Springs, MI, 49104.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the founding of the church, Seventh-Day Adventists have believed in abstinence from alcohol and drug use.  Adventists, however, have begun to discover that their church is not completely immune to general societal changes in accepting, even promoting, the use of alcohol and drugs.  This study was designed to explore whether these changes were widespread among the church membership or limited to symptoms of youthful &quot;wild oats.&quot;  A simple random sample of 5,053 households was selected from the mailing list of the North American monthly edition of the <I>Adventist Review</I>.  Data showed that, except for caffeine, most Adventists (from 64-95 percent) have never used any addictive drug.  However, the data also showed that a small, but significant minority, are current users of drugs.  Of particular concern was the trend towards increased drinking among younger members.  While findings confirm that Adventists are much more likely than the general public to be abstinent, the data strongly suggests the need for the church to vigorously revitalize its theological position on abstinence and to strengthen its prevention programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion</I> 26(2):218-223, 1987<BR>
(Available from Andrews University, Department of Christian Ministry, Berrien Springs, MI 49104.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In an attempt to identify factors that predict frequency of drug use by youth within a conservative denomination, a sample of 801 young people between the ages of 12 and 24 from 71 churches in North America were chosen.  The youth were questioned on the frequency of use of 10 drug categories as well as reasons for not using drugs, a variety of religious attitudes and behaviors, and educational and membership practices.  As a reason for not using drugs, &quot;My commitment to Christ&quot; was the strongest predictor of abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and all drugs combined.  Other factors of nearly equal strength were &quot;I want to be in control of my life&quot; and &quot;Concern for my health.&quot;  As to religious practices, regular participation in family worship was most highly related to abstinence over all categories with attendance at Sabbath School first for alcohol and personal prayer first for tobacco.  Watching R-rated movies and listening to hard rock music (both strongly discouraged by the church) were both predictive of more frequent use, while intending to remain in the church and believing that God wants us to take care of our bodies were both associated with less frequency.  While membership status of youth, mother, or father or years of parochial education had little effect on frequency of usage, joining the church at a younger age had a weak protective effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the past, most studies looking at the effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD) included predominantly male subjects.  But recently researchers have begun to look at the effects of ATOD specific to women, and the results have been startling.  Women face different, more serious physiological effects of alcohol, use ATOD as a result of separate emotional issues, and confront more difficulties in obtaining treatment.</P>
This resource guide is designed to call attention to these issues and encourage us to face the problems head on.  By working together we can help educate women of the risks of AOD.  Prevention Works!  Now let's make it work for everyone!

<B>High Rates of Alcohol Use and History of Physical and Sexual Abuse among Women Outpatients
<I>Swett, C.; Cohen, C.; Surrey, J.; Compaine, A.; and Chavez, R. </I></B> <BR> 
<I>American Journal of Drug Alcohol Abuse </I>17(1): 49-60, 1991<BR>
(Available from Chester Swett Jr., Brattleboro Retreat, 75 Linden Street, Brattleboro, VT 05301.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>A total of 189 consecutive new women patients were surveyed at an adult psychiatric outpatient clinic that did not have a specific program for the treatment of alcoholics. Twenty-seven patients (14 percent) reported a history of heavy alcohol consumption measured by scores of 10 or more on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), but only 16 had a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence made by a clinician. Those with a self-reported history of physical and/or sexual abuse had significantly higher scores on the MAST than those with no such history. When the first abuse occurred before the age of 18 years and there was no recent reported abuse, the association of abuse and high MAST scores persisted, suggesting that early physical or sexual abuse may be associated with current levels of alcohol use.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Adapting the Traditional EAP Model to Effectively Serve Battered Women in the Workplace<BR>
<I>Bryant, V.; Eliach, J.; and Green, S. L.<BR></I></B>
<I>Employee Assistance Quarterly </I>6(2): 1-10, 1990<BR>
(Available from Valerie Bryant, 290 Carlton Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11205.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>While domestic violence is frequently correlated with chemical dependency, EAP professionals have been slow to identify and address this widespread social problem. The authors believe it is crucial for EAP professionals to recognize the numerous disguised ways domestic violence presents itself both in the workplace and in the EAP assessment interview. They suggest that an alternative to the traditional assessment and referral model is indicated to effectively serve this population. A new model of clinical EAP practice with this population is introduced.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Women, Alcohol and Incest: Analytical Review<BR>
<I>Hurley, D. L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>52(3): 253-268, 1991<BR>
(Available from Dorothy L. Hurley, Training and Organizational Development, University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, 45 Knightsbridge Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study examines the historical treatment of two phenomena that negatively affect the lives of millions of women_incest and alcoholism. It explores the similarities in characteristics of alcoholic women and women with histories of incest. Before the early 1980s, incest histories were rarely mentioned in the literature on alcohol. Similarly, the literature on incest makes only passing references to alcohol abuse among adolescent and adult survivors. Hence, formal research comparisons between the alcoholic woman and the incest-surviving woman are lacking. The purpose of this study is not merely to illustrate the similarities between the alcoholic woman and the incest-surviving woman, but also to present a persuasive argument that multidisciplinary research efforts are essential to promote the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of women who suffer both alcoholism and incest. To accomplish these goals, this study presents parallel reviews of (1) women and alcohol and (2) women and incest. It then develops a comparative profile of the alcoholic woman and the incest-surviving woman. Additionally, the sparse information on the alcoholic incest-surviving woman is reviewed. This study points to the need for further research to address the compelling question that emerges: Why do some incest-surviving women become alcoholic while others do not?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Influence of Substance Use among Adult Female Inmates<BR>

<I>Journal of Drug Issues </I>21(2): 449-467, 1991<BR>
(Available from William R. Blount, University of South Florida, Department of Criminology, Tampa, FL 33620.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Using a 90-percent sample (1,076) of the women incarcerated in August 1985 in Florida prisons and a &quotnon-use, casual/recreational use, problem use&quot typology, the extent of substance abuse was found to be inversely related to age at first arrest as an adult, age at incarceration, and employment at time of arrest. Extent of substance use was directly related to number and percent of prior offenses and incarcerations, broken parental home, and criminality in the family of origin. Though non-users were more likely to be convicted of homicide, casual/recreational users were the most violent. No evidence was found for an increase in substance use/abuse between 1975 and 1985.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Biobehavioral Research on Nicotine Use in Women<BR>

(Available from Cynthia S. Pomerleau, University of Michigan, Department of Psychiatry, Behavioral Medicine Program, Riverview Medical Building, 900 Wall Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>More American women are taking up smoking than men and fewer are quitting; if current trends continue, rates for women will surpass those for men by the mid-1990s. Ironically, much of what is known about the biobehavioral aspects of smoking is based on research using male subjects. The paper reviews evidence suggesting that: (1) women may differ from men with regard to nicotine intake and/or effects; (2) nicotine intake and effects may be influenced by menstrual cycle phase; (3) oral contraceptive use and estrogen replacement therapy may affect intake and effects of nicotine; (4) the effects of chronic nicotine use on female reproductive endocrinology may have implications for the reinforcement of smoking; and (5) pharmacological agents used to treat smoking may have different effects in women than in men. Guidelines and suggestions are presented by future biobehavioral research in women, including standardization of assessment procedures, attention to the use of appropriate controls, and use of pharmacological probes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>Though treatment programs for women may be similar or identical to those developed for male substance abusers, gender related factors merit special attention. This chapter focuses on three important areas for substance abuse treatment programs developed for women. These areas include special considerations for pharmacy-therapeutic treatment of drug abuse and dependence for women and development of new medications for women who abuse drugs; polydrug abuse in association with alcohol abuse by women and their unique needs; and new findings on gender-related differences that are both antecedent to and consequent on cocaine abuse. 44 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>AIDS Prevention for Women at Risk: Experience from a National Demonstration Research Program<BR>
<I>Weissman, G.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Primary Prevention </I>12(1): 49-63, 1991<BR>
(Available from Gloria Weissman, National Institute on Drug Abuse, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 9A42, Rockville, MD 20857.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>This paper discusses data from a national research program working with large numbers of women at risk for HIV. Important similarities between injection-drug-using (IDU) women and the non-injecting partners of IDU men have been shown. High levels of non-injection drug use are common to both groups, as are crack use and the trading of sex for crack. Despite considerable knowledge about AIDS, risky sex and drug injection behaviors are the rule. Many important principles for outreach and intervention with women have also emerged, including the need for simultaneously aggressive and sensitive outreach strategies and for interventions that consider the full context of these women's lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>AIDS Knowledge, Perception of Risk, and Behaviors among Female Sex Partners of Injection Drug Users<BR>
<I>Corby, N. H.; Wolitski, R. J.; Thornton-Johnson, S.; and Tanner, W. M.</I></B><BR>
<I>AIDS Education and Prevention </I>3(4): 353-366, 1991<BR>
(Available from Nancy H. Corby, Ph.D., Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services, 2655 Pine Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90806.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interviews were conducted with 137 female sex partners of male injection drug users to provide quantitative and qualitative information regarding their AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and specific risk behaviors. Levels of knowledge regarding HIV transmission and prevention were high, with an average of 81.8 percent correct on a 16-item test. Most women (87.5 percent) believed that there was at least some chance they would become HIV infected. Substance abuse was prevalent; 67.2 percent used non-injection drugs (44.5 percent used crack cocaine), and 32.1 percent reported prior use of injection drugs. One-fifth had engaged in prostitution. Although AIDS knowledge was high, almost all (94.9 percent) reported engaging in unprotected vaginal intercourse during the previous 6 months, and 6.6 percent reported anal intercourse without a condom. Among women who did not report consistent condom use, the most frequently stated reasons for non-use of condoms were dislike by their male partner (26.9 percent) and/or personal dislike of condoms (23.1 percent). A disturbing pattern of increased risk was observed among African-American interviewees, who were more likely than Latinos or Whites to have contracted syphilis, have multiple sex partners, engage in prostitution, use crack cocaine, and drink alcohol daily.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Eating Disorders and Alcohol Abuse in Women<BR>
<I>Goldbloom, D. S.; Naranjo, C. A.; Bremner, K. E.; and Hicks, L. K.</I></B><BR>
<I>British Journal of Addiction </I>87(6): 913-920, 1992<BR>
(Available from David S. Goldbloom, Eaton 8N-219, The Toronto Hospital, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C4.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Theory and empirical evidence support a relationship between eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) and alcoholism. This study examines the coprevalence and characteristics of these disorders among two populations of adult women: those presenting for treatment of alcoholism and those referred to a specialized eating disorders program. Twenty-two of 73 females (30.1 percent) with alcohol problems met psychometric cutoff scores for eating disorder, while 25 of the 96 eating disorder females (26.9 percent) gave psychometric evidence of alcohol dependence. These rates exceed general population norms. While certain clinical and psychometric features distinguish subgroups with both disorders, the basis for coprevalence and the implications for treatment are unknown.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Acculturation and Changes in Drinking Patterns among Mexican-American Women<BR>
<I>Gilbert, M. J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Alcohol Health and Research World </I>15(3): 234-238, 1991
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the last decade, researchers have developed extensive data on the epidemiology of alcohol use and alcohol problems among Latino populations. Research has established several consistent findings: Latinas are more likely to be abstainers or very light drinkers than their male counterparts; Latinas, more than Latino men, show a linear acculturation change with more women drinking in each generation beyond immigration status; and Mexican-American women report heavy drinking and problems related to alcohol more often than Cuban-American and Puerto Rican women. This article 
looks at the patterns of alcohol use associated with acculturation among Latinas, with special attention to findings from studies of Mexican-American women. The researchers confirm an increase in alcohol consumption by Mexican-American women with each successive generation following immigration to the United States. Changes in drinking patterns are thought to be part of an acculturation process in which these women adopt the behaviors and attitudes of women in the general population. Implications for prevention are discussed. 26 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Substance Use/Misuse among Female Prostitutes and Female Arrestees<BR>
<I>Kuhns, J. B.; Heide, K. M.; and Silverman, I.</I></B><BR>
<I>International Journal of Addictions </I>27(11): 1283-1292, 1992 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The literature has documented the correlation between prostitution and drug use/misuse. This study probed demographics, drug use experimentation and frequency, age of first drug use, and drug use treatment among 53 female prostitutes and 47 female arrestees. The results showed that: (1) prostitutes were likely to drop out of school; (2) significantly more prostitutes had tried drugs, had used drugs with greater frequency, and had begun drug/alcohol use at younger ages. These results imply that: early drug/alcohol use and withdrawal from school could make young women vulnerable and at higher risk of becoming involved in prostitution; and drug use treatment and intervention need to begin at younger ages. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Why We Are Concerned: An Overview of Women and Alcohol<BR>
<I>Blume, S.</I></B><BR>
<I>The Counselor</I>, January-February: 14, 20, 1989
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effects of alcohol consumption on women are discussed. It is noted that most studies on alcohol and alcohol-related problems are based on the responses of men, and that the results are very different when repeated with women. Physically, physiologically, and psychologically, women respond differently to alcohol than do men. In addition, most treatment programs were initially designed for men, while women remain underrepresented. Three intervention approaches developed for alcoholism are better at reaching men than women: (1) the drinking driver program, (2) the public inebriate program, and (3) the employee assistance program. Screening and outreach for women should be developed in medical and family service settings. The facts presented here emphasize the need for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for women suffering from the disease of alcoholism. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Spousal Violence among Alcoholic Women as Compared to a Random Household Sample of Women<BR>
<I>Miller, B. A.; Downs, W. R.; and Gondoli, D. M.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Studies on Alcohol </I>50(6): 533-540, 1989 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between spousal violence and women's alcoholism problems. This study compares two samples: (1) 45 alcoholic women selected from local treatment agencies and Alcoholics Anonymous groups; and (2) 40 nonalcoholic women selected randomly from households. Two-hour interview schedules were administered to both samples. The Conflict Tactics Scale was used to assess spouse-to-woman violence. Alcoholic women were found to have higher levels of spouse-to-woman negative verbal interaction, moderate violence, and severe violence as compared to the household women. Multivariate analyses revealed that spouse violence scores were strong predictors of type of sample. This was true even after controlling for presence of alcohol problems in the spouse, income, parental violence, parental alcohol problems, and changes in parental family. These findings suggest that alcoholism treatment programs should screen for spousal violence among women alcoholics, and that victims of spousal violence should be screened for alcohol-related problems. 30 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Gender Differences in Drinking Patterns among College Students:  A Review of the Literature<BR>
<I>Engs, R. C., and Hanson, D. J.</I></B><BR>
<I>Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education </I>35(2): 36-47, 1990 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Studies on gender variations in drinking patterns and problems among college students are reviewed. Most studies report a higher percentage of drinkers among male than among female collegians, although some studies have found no gender differences and others have reported a higher percentage of female than male drinkers. Higher drinking frequencies and consumption levels in male college students have been consistently reported for decades. Several reasons have been suggested for the different drinking patterns of males and females, including a traditional belief that alcohol use and abuse is a male prerogative, the expectation of conventionality for females, and economic dependence of women on men. It appears, however, that changes in women's roles are accompanied by increased drinking among women. Although differences between the sexes on frequency and volume of drinking are narrowing, males continue to experience more alcohol problems and have different attitudes and motivations for drinking. Gender differences have also been reported in beverage preference and drinking locations. It is recommended that college alcohol policies and programs reflect these continuing gender differences.  74 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Alcohol Alert </I>10: 1-4, 1990 I<BR>
(Available from the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information, P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20847.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This issue of Alcohol Alerts deals with alcohol consumption by women. There are demographic differences in drinking among women and it may vary in different races and ethnic groups. Women have diminished first-pass metabolism of alcohol and are more susceptible than men to the physiological consequences of drinking. The relationship between drinking and breast cancer remains unclear but continued drinking may have adverse effects on fertility. Women alcoholics may encounter different treatment conditions that facilitate or discourage their entry into treatment. The article concludes with a note on women as research subjects in alcohol studies. 49 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Linnea Klee, Prevention Research Center, 2532 Durant Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94704.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In-depth interviews with 65 women in treatment contributed to a taxonomy of indicators of women's alcohol problems, with five major categories and numerous subcategories. The largest number of client indicators appeared in the individual (psychological and behavioral) category. The physiological category included unique indicators regarding physical appearance. Within the social category, family/partner relationships were emphasized. The taxonomy can be useful in therapeutic assessments, to develop survey items, in comparative research, or in alcohol program development. 37 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Effects of Alcohol Consumption on Plasma and Urinary Hormone Concentrations in Premenopausal Women<BR>

(Available from the National Cancer Institute, International Cancer Information Center, Building 82, Room 103, Bethesda, MD 20892, 301-496-2794) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most epidemiologic studies of the relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk over the past decade have shown that persons who consume a moderate amount of alcohol are at a 40 to 100 percent greater risk of breast cancer than those who do not consume alcohol. Dose-response effects have been observed, but no causal relationship has been established. This study examines the hypothesis that alcohol consumption affects levels of reproductive hormones. A controlled-diet study lasting for six consecutive menstrual cycles was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, and a crossover design was used. During the last three menstrual cycles, alcohol consumption of the two groups was reversed. Thirty-four premenopausal women, ages 21 to 40 years, with a history of regular menstrual cycles, consumed 30g of ethanol per day for three menstrual cycles and no alcohol for the other three. All food and alcohol consumed were provided by the study. The study showed increases in total estrogen levels and amount of bioavailable estrogens in association with alcohol consumption in premenopausal women. This possible explanatory mechanism for a positive association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk merits further investigation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Epidemiologic Reviews, 2007 E. Monument Street, Baltimore, MD 21205-2216.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Positive associations between alcohol and breast cancer have been observed in many epidemiologic studies. Confounding cannot be ruled out as an explanation: the associations have been weak and inconsistent, the causes of breast cancer are to a large extent unknown, and lifestyle correlates of alcohol use are poorly defined. Several biologic mechanisms have been suggested; however, they have little credibility. Epidemiologic methods have improved over the years. Case-control and follow-up studies of alcohol and breast cancer acceptable a decade ago are now considered inadequate. Rigorous attempts have been made to improve participation rates, decrease losses to follow-up, and obtain more detailed information on alcohol exposure and confounding factors. Further investigations must be more rigorous, with particular attention paid to alcohol use at various points in a woman's life and in various subgroups, and to more control of potentially confounding factors. This, coupled with investigation of the postulated mechanisms and with more knowledge of the biology of breast cancer, should eventually enable us to decide if alcohol and breast cancer are causally related.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The chemically dependent lesbian carries a double stigma in U.S. society. Little is known about lesbian alcoholism and drug abuse because society denies the existence of both lesbians and alcoholic women. Issues unique to the lesbian client are outlined, including the high proportion of lesbians who are adult children of alcoholics (ACOAs), heavy reliance on social support in a bar or other public area where drinking is prevalent, excessive isolation, and ambivalent sexual feelings.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Meyer D. Glantz, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Division of Clinical Research, Room 10-A-20, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many elderly are likely to be involved in inappropriate drug and/or alcohol use. The probable forms of the inappropriate use are more varied than with other age populations, the elderly themselves may not be the perpetrators, and identification and differential diagnosis will often be difficult. As sparse as the data on elderly drug use, misuse, and abuse are, the data related to elderly women are less complete. Nevertheless, research support is available for the following conclusions: (1) alcohol abuse and the abuse of illegal drugs are not widespread problems for elderly women; however, they are likely to increasingly become problems as younger women drinkers and illicit drug users age; (2) elderly women are at risk for self- and other-perpetrated drug misuse, including drug-drug and drug-alcohol interactions, and may also be at some risk for self-perpetrated abuse involving legal psychotropics; and (3) elderly women are at greater risk for physician-perpetrated drug abuse involving prescription psychoactive drugs than any other age by gender group.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Drinking and Driving by Young Females<BR>
<I>Popkin, C. L.</I></B><BR>
<I>Accident Analysis and Prevention </I>23(1): 37-44, 1991<BR>
(Available from Carol L. Popkin, Highway Safety Research Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent research shows that women are drinking and driving more often and that the proportion of female drivers involved in fatal crashes is increasing. U.S. Fatal Accident Reporting System data (Fell 1987) suggest that although alcohol involvement rates in fatal crashes have been declining for the past 4 years, the rates for females ages 21 to 24 have not, and their alcohol involvement rate in late-night single vehicle (SV) crashes, a surrogate measure of alcohol-related (A/R) crashes, is almost as high as that of male drivers. This paper examines the involvement of North Carolina female drivers who are less than 35 years old from 1976 through 1985. It reports on trends in driver licensing, arrests for drinking and driving, SV nighttime and A/R crashes, and measured blood alcohol levels in fatalities. It identifies an emerging driving-while-impaired (DWI) problem for younger women, particularly those 21 to 24 years of age. Significant trends on the involvement of women will have implications for the design and implementation of educational, deterrence, enforcement, and rehabilitation programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Women in Treatment<BR>
<I>Aydelotte, R.</I></B><BR>
<I>Employee Assistance</I> August 1991, pp. 20, 23 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this brief article the author examines the treatment barriers faced by women seeking recovery. Women come into recovery with more guilt and shame than their male counterparts, and many feel that they do not even deserve treatment. Certain stereotypes can keep women from seeking treatment, such as the tendency among employers and physicians not to recognize and/or acknowledge the addicted female. Denial becomes a major impediment to treatment; often those who should be supportive of a woman will instead blame her problem on premenstrual syndrome or the like. According to the 
author, a host of issues and problems affect the quality of treatment offered to women, including the medical profession's prejudice against females. Physical problems associated with alcoholism and drug abuse, as well as pregnancy, are also discussed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Early adolescence is characterized by a heightened consciousness of self and others. The availability of drugs and alcohol to adolescent females, patterns of drug use, and stages of drug use are explored. Predictive influences of female adolescent drug use are discussed, including age, education and socioeconomic class, ethnicity, and regional use patterns, parental attitudes, family size and structure, and peer influences. Many personality factors are correlates of female adolescent drug use, including alienation and independence, ego strength, antisocial behaviors, and affiliated needs. Special problems for this population include rape, depression, and pregnancy. 24 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Springer Publishing Co., Inc., 536 Broadway, New York, NY 10012-3955.)  
<BLOCKQUOTE>A feminist perspective is presented on the issues affecting treatment for women who suffer from psychotropic drug dependencies. The reasons that almost two-thirds of prescription drugs are taken by women are outlined. The psychotropic drug literature is reviewed. Analysis of these studies reveals that assumptions are made about women's psychological status and mental health that should be challenged from a feminist perspective. As long as pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals perpetuate the belief that women need psychotropic drugs, which is reinforced by sex-role stereotypes of women as dependent, then any consequences women suffer from overuse or abuse will be ignored. Macro level recommendations for changes in social policy and social institutions and micro level suggestions for clinicians treating psychotropic addictions are presented. 55 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The marketing and promotion activities of the U.S. tobacco industry are reviewed in relation to African Americans, Latinos, and women. Specific areas include social and economic characteristics, marketing and promotion through support to minority-owned business, journalism scholarship endowments, cultural activity support, art sponsorships, employment, majority advertising in minority publications, political contributions, and sponsorship of athletic events. The tobacco industry has been investing in African-American and Latino communities and in women's organizations for a long time. In return, it has achieved a status among these groups that is more than the sum of money received. The author recommends the following: analysis of marketing and promotion to targeted communities; assessment of community factors that aid targeting by the tobacco industry; study of the relationship between marketing and promotion and the use of tobacco by members of the respective communities; identification of the common features in the targeted marketing and promotion strategies in the United States and other countries; identification of the common strategies for alcohol, tobacco, and 
illicit drugs; and an examination of the shift from advertising to promotion that has occurred with these targeted groups. 48 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>

(Available from Dean Krahn, William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison, WI 53705.) 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Patients with bulimia nervosa frequently have problems with alcoholism and other substance abuse. This study assessed whether the relationship between eating abnormalities and substance abuse extends to subthreshold levels of dieting and substance use. A self-administered questionnaire assessing dieting and substance use (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana) was completed by 1,796 women before their first year in college. Using a scale derived from DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa and previous research in this population, subjects were categorized as nondieters, casual, intense, severe, at-risk, or bulimic dieters. The relationship between the dieting-severity category and frequency and intensity of alcohol use and frequency of marijuana and cigarette use was assessed. DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa were met by 1.6 percent of the women. Only 13.8 percent of these women were nondieters. Increasing dieting severity was positively associated with increasing prevalence of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and with increasing frequency and intensity of alcohol use. The bulimic and at-risk dieters were similar in their alcohol and other drug use. The relationship between eating disorders and alcoholism and other substance abuse noted in clinical populations extends in a continuous, graded manner to subthreshold levels of dieting and substance use behaviors. Dieting-related attitudes and behaviors in young women may be related to increased susceptibility to alcohol and drug abuse.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Roth, P. (Ed.)</I></B><BR>
Metuchen, NJ: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 1991. 192 p. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>This book reviews issues for multicultural groups of women and explores the linkages between women's health, social, and policy issues and alcohol and drugs. A broad range of issues affecting women's lives is examined in volume one of this two-volume set. The connections between alcohol and other drug problems and other issues such as incest and sexual abuse, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, sexism, racism, underemployment, and poverty are described. Familial and environmental influences affect women's use of alcohol and other drugs. Poverty, access to medical care and adequate treatment, problems related to homelessness, the effects of drug use during pregnancy, living with an alcoholic or drug dependent parent, and the effects of advertising on women are all critical issues examined in this book. Self-help groups for women with alcohol and drug problems are assessed, as is the importance of women advocating for women to generate gender-sensitive alcohol and drug prevention and treatment services. Issues relevant to adolescent girls and young women are also included in several chapters. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This book provides a step-by-step guide to replicating the innovative, award winning model program developed by the Women's Alcohol and Drug Education Project of the Women's Action Alliance. The program was tested at six diverse women's centers in different regions of the country. The model program and guide focus on alcohol, drugs, and related issues most relevant for Latino, African-American, and low-income white women and their children. The model program can be easily carried out in a broad range of women's centers and service organizations that serve adult women and/or teens. Sections cover: getting started, support from the community, staffing, training, organization, program activities, community activities, evaluation of the model, a cycle of classes, and resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In: <I> Comprehensive Handbook of Drug and Alcohol Addiction</I>, N.S. Miller, Ed., pp. 147-177. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker, 1991 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Societal attitudes toward intoxicated women are discussed and traced from biblical times. These attitudes are said to have evolved into a double-edged sword that simultaneously seeks to protect and inaccurately stereotype women. Both female alcoholics and female addicts are victims of a threefold stigma. First, they are victims of the same stigma attached to all alcoholics and addicts. Secondly, a higher standard of behavior is expected of women. The result is that the same behavior considered acceptable for men is considered scandalous for women. Thirdly, and most injurious, is the sexual stigma attached to women who drink or use drugs, and are hence acceptable targets for sexual aggression. The stereotypical connection between drinking and sexual promiscuity in women is also traced to the ancient world. This chapter provides an indepth examination of these social stigmas associated with women who drink, and how these stigmas in turn affect the woman herself. Growing up in a society dominated by these stereotypes, the chemically dependent woman reacts to her problem 
with guilt and shame. Also discussed in this chapter are screening methods, diagnosis, psychosocial and hereditary factors, treatment, mortality, and policy issues that deal with prevention and removing treatment barriers. 183 Ref.</BLOCKQUOTE>
