OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC WINE GRAPE PRODUCTION<BR>
IN THE NORTH COAST<BR>
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Recently, many wine grape growers in the North Coast region
of California have shown an interest in organic agricultural production
techniques. This interest may be influenced by concerns about
long-term soil health and crop viability and such factors as a
desire to decrease the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.
Growers may also view organic production as a marketing tool to
appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.
<P>
This overview is meant to guide the reader through topics and
issues that are integral to organic wine grape farming. Like conventional
farming, there are numerous approaches to farming grapes organically,
from vineyard spacing and trellis design to floor management and
agricultural inputs. The following is a discussion of common practices
and issues related to organic wine grape production.
<P>
The first section of this overview describes the seasonal flow
of operations for the production of organic wine grapes. Next,
the cover crop and pest management sections give greater details
of these practices. Finally, the current status of regulations
for organically grown grapes and organic wine are discussed.
<P>
<U><B>Production Practices</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Cultural operations often begin each year after harvest with
a postharvest irrigation. Soil amendments are then applied to
vineyard soils where tissue and soil analysis, as well as grower
experience, have shown it to be appropriate. Mined limestone is
commonly applied once every third year in many North Coast vineyards.
This practice helps neutralize soil acidity (where applicable),
adds calcium to soils, improves drainage, soil tilth and the overall
availability of nutrients for crop production. Alternatively,
growers in some areas may apply gypsum to manage soil fertility
and soil nutrient levels. Gypsum adds calcium and sulfur for crop
production and can be used to improve soil tilth with soils high
in sodium. Soils deficient in phosphorus may receive applications
of rock phosphate and/or bone meal. Sulfate of potash may be banded
under the vines each year to boost and maintain potassium levels.
A compost of various materials (including manures and grape pomace)
can be spread either in vine rows and centers or vine rows only
depending upon the amount applied and the purpose of the application.
For example, growers may spread compost in vine rows and centers
to increase soil organic matter throughout the vineyard, stimulate
soil microbial activity and increase overall nutrient levels.
Alternatively, growers may choose to spread compost in vine rows
only as a means of supplying nutrients specifically for crop production.
The above operations are performed in September, October or November
depending upon when harvest occurs. Seeded cover crops are planted
and irrigated up directly after these operations. Alternatively,
if resident vegetation is used as a cover crop, then no specific
seeding operations or cover crop irrigation is performed.
<P>
Vineyard pruning takes place in December, January and February.
Vine training wires are moved downward during pruning operations
to prepare the trellis system for the new year's growth. This
is included as an operational cost for pruning. The timing of
pruning operations is critical; early pruning causes wounds to
be more susceptible to Eutypa dieback (<I>Eutypa lata</I>) if
rains should occur in December and also may expose spurs and canes
to freeze damage following a mild fall, especially in the northern
mountain areas. Prunings are thrown into the centers and shredded
and chopped with a mower/chopper. This practice is performed either
immediately after pruning or later in the season in conjunction
with spring mowing, depending on vineyard floor management practices.
<P>
A dormant spray of lime sulfur may be applied in January in some
vineyards. This practice can help decrease disease and insect
pressures from powdery mildew (<I>Uncinula necator</I>), mite
pests and overwintering insects within the vineyard. One trade-off,
however, is that lime sulfur applications usually increase mortality
rates for predaceous mites. The use of lime sulfur is therefore
not a common practice among many organic growers, but might be
used as an alternative pest control measure following years with
severe pest pressure.
<P>
Powdery mildew is controlled by multiple applications of sulfur
in the spring and summer months. In general, and depending on
management technique, a wettable sulfur is applied with an air
blast sprayer every 7 to 14 days beginning mid to late March when
growth is between budbreak and two inches. Alternatively, some
growers may choose to apply dusting sulfur with a duster during
this time. Later in the season, however, most growers will apply
dusting sulfur to vines every 7 to 14 days to speed operations,
decrease costs and increase the material's effective coverage.
Grower experience indicates that sulfur dust applications may
also increase mortality rates for predaceous mites.
<P>
Frost protection can be accomplished by either overhead sprinklers
or wind machines. When vines are irrigated with drip irrigation,
frost protection by either method represents an additional investment.
Substantial variation exists among the counties in the number
of nights per year that frost protection is necessary. The following
table lists the average frost protection requirements by overhead
sprinklers among the North Coast counties.<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>
Hand vine care, which takes place from April through July, includes
a number of operations. Shoot thinning and suckering (removal
of water sprouts), takes place in April and May. Vine training
wires are moved three times (in April, May and June <I>or </I>May,
June and July depending on the vineyard location) to support and
accommodate vine and grape growth. Leaf removal is performed after
bloom and fruit-set to help control bunch rot (<I>Botrytis cinerea</I>)
and possibly decrease leafhopper populations.
<P>
The delivery method and the amount of water applied to vines may
vary from county to county and vineyard to vineyard. Water is
generally applied to vines from May through August. Most of the
water is applied early to mid season, with less applied closer
to harvest. Total applied water will be dependent on seasonal
rains, rooting depth, the amount of moisture stored in the soil
profile and how vineyard floor vegetation is managed. Also, soils
with increased levels of organic matter may be better able to
retain moisture and therefore decrease the amount of applied water.
<P>
Harvesting may be done by hand or by machine depending on the
vineyard design. Generally, a custom operator manages the harvest.
Depending on the county, grape variety and the yearly conditions,
harvest can take place over the period of late August through
mid November.
<P>
Yields of organically grown and conventionally produced wine grapes
are similar, and can range from approximately three to nine tons
per acre. Yields will vary depending on a number of factors including
the vineyard design, grape variety, vineyard age, county of production
and yearly growing conditions. Average yields for all grape production
are shown for the various counties in the following table.<BR>

Commodities that are produced organically can often be sold for
a higher price than conventionally grown products. However, few
pricing premiums for organic wine grapes currently exist. Therefore,
grower returns for both organic and conventional wine grapes are
usually the same, and can range from approximately $300 to $1,700
per ton depending on the grape variety and quality, county of
production and current market conditions. Average returns for
white and red varieties are shown for the various counties in

<P>
<U><B>Cover Crops</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Cover crops can be beneficial for the production of organic
wine grapes in a number of ways. If leguminous cover crops are
used, soil nitrogen may be increased through nitrogen fixation.
Water penetration and infiltration may be improved by root growth
of the cover crop and by returning organic matter to soils. Microbial
activity, often stimulated by cover crop root exudates and organic
matter additions to soils, has been shown to promote soil aggregate
stability. Microbes also enhance the decomposition process by
breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients in a form
that crops can more readily use. Increased organic matter can
also improve the soil's ability to retain moisture. Hilly North
Coast vineyards with substantial bare ground may benefit from
planting cover crops to help control erosion. Cover crops increase
the plant diversity of the vineyard and can provide nectar to
attract and sustain beneficial arthropods (insects, spiders, and
predatory mites). Cover crops can also reduce dust problems in
vineyard systems which in turn can help reduce spider mite pests.
Weed suppression may be another direct benefit of cover cropping
depending on the species or mix selected. Lastly, farm machinery
may be able to enter vineyards earlier and later in the season
in situations where a cover crop's (especially perennial cover
crops) mat of root and vegetative growth provides support on wet
soil. This may also serve to reduce soil compaction.
<P>
There may also be some disadvantages with using cover crops in
vineyards. Cover crops increase cash costs for seed and labor,
and may require the rental or purchase of additional farm machinery.
Competition between vines and cover crops may increase the need
for additional inputs such as water and nutrients. This should
be taken into consideration because water may be in short supply
in some North Coast vineyards. Some growers, however, view the
cost of planting and maintaining a cover crop as the cost of producing
nitrogen and/or improving soil quality for the long-term. Vine
row cover crops, which are sometimes used to suppress weeds in
no&#173;till systems, may provide a habitat for vertebrate pests
which can damage vines. Cover crops may also attract arthropod
pests to the vineyard. Another disadvantage of cover cropping
may be that air and soil temperatures are lowered by substantial
vegetative growth on the vineyard floor. This could increase the
possibility of frost damage. Cover crops are often closely mowed
or disced under during critical frost periods to overcome this
problem. Reduced soil and air temperatures may also delay bud
break.
<P>
Selection of a particular cover crop species should take into
account the yearly production cycle of the vine crop as well as
the climate, which dictates the planting time and winter cold
tolerance of the cover crop. Also, growers should select cover
crops for the specific needs of a vineyard. For example, if soil
nitrogen is in short supply, then a leguminous cover crop may
be preferred. If, however, increased soil organic matter is desired,
then a cover crop that includes legumes, grasses and other species
for biomass production may be the best alternative. In addition,
the soil type and the irrigation system should be taken into consideration.
Growers in some areas may find that certain cover crop species
and mixes are not suitable for their soils and conditions. Often,
the most suitable cover crop in each situation is determined by
observation and experimentation over a period of years.
<P>
In this production region several different legumes, perennial
grasses, and annual grasses are commonly planted as cover crops.
Alternatively, resident vegetation is often managed as a cover
crop. There are a number of options for managing annually sown
cover crops. If sown in the fall, the cover crop is generally
irrigated up with one to three inches of water depending on the
planting date, the amount of moisture stored in the soil profile
and seasonal rains. After this time, cover crop growth is often
dependent on fall and winter rains. In years when sufficient soil
moisture exists and/or early fall rains occur, no irrigation for
cover crop germination may be necessary. Also, vineyards without
overhead sprinkler systems generally rely on fall rains for cover
crop germination.
<P>
In the spring months management practices for annually sown cover
crops depend upon grower preference and the needs of the vineyard.
For example, some growers will mow the cover crop and incorporate
the residue by discing to reduce competition between the cover
crop and vines for water and nutrients. This practice is also
performed to speed decomposition of the vegetation and recycling
of nutrients. As an alternative after the initial cover crop mowing,
the residue may be left on the soil surface to decompose more
slowly. This practice is often preferred by those growers whose
goal is to minimize tillage operations and improve soil tilth
and structure for the long-term. Growers may then disc or mow
periodically during the summer to keep vineyard floors free of
vegetative growth, or plant a summer annual cover crop to maintain
a diverse habitat within the vineyard. Costs will vary accordingly.
<P>
Some growers may use yet another strategy for managing annually
sown cover crops. In this case, only a portion of the rows of
the cover crop are mowed initially to reduce some of the above
ground biomass. The remaining cover crop rows will continue to
provide sufficient habitat to sustain beneficial insect populations
that are already present in the vineyard. Grower experience indicates
that the number of insect pests that move to the vines may be
reduced when a portion of the cover crop remains. With regrowth
of the cover crop in the mowed rows, the remaining (unmowed) rows
are then mowed and disced. Therefore, a portion of the cover crop
will remain growing in the vineyard for a longer period of time
as an insect attractant. The disced rows may be left bare or reseeded
with a summer annual cover crop depending on the management practices
and the availability of water. Later in the season or after germination
and growth of the planted summer cover crop occur, the remainder
of the winter sown cover crop will generally be mowed and disced
under. Periodic discings may be performed in these rows during
the summer months.
<P>
Fall irrigation is generally unnecessary when resident vegetation
is managed as a cover crop. Growth of this cover crop is dependent
on moisture in the soil profile from fall and winter rains. No
tillage operations are generally performed in the spring to incorporate
vegetative growth, however resident vegetation is mowed periodically
in the spring and summer months to reduce the above ground biomass.
In the warmer summer months resident vegetation dies back; little
or no management is therefore required during this time. However,
overall vineyard irrigation requirements are increased because
of competition between the vegetation and the vine growth. Alternatively,
resident vegetation may be handled similarly to a planted cover
crop in that it is disced in the spring.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Pest Management</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Most pesticides that are currently used by producers of conventionally
grown wine grapes are not approved for use by organic wine grape
growers. Sulfur is a notable exception. In general, pest control
products used by organic growers are not as effective for immediate
or acute problems as are those products used by conventional growers.
The cost for some organically acceptable pest control methods
may also be prohibitive for some growers. Therefore, vineyard
monitoring, pest identification and pest prevention are essential
elements of successful organic wine grape production.
<P>
The incidence of certain diseases such as bunch rot and powdery
mildew can be increased by moist, humid weather and spring and
fall rains. Bunch rot can often be decreased by removing leaves
around grape clusters after bloom and fruit-set to open the vine
canopy to sunlight and increase air circulation. Vineyard leaf
removal is generally performed one time only, however, in years
with increased bunch rot incidence, a second leaf removal operation
may be necessary. The incidence of powdery mildew is lessened
with sulfur applications. In spite of the potentially greater
disease incidence in organic vineyards, yields for organic wine
grapes in the North Coast are generally equal to those in conventional
culture<B>.</B>
<P>
Leafhopper and mite problems may be lessened with applications
of insecticidal soap and pyrethrin. Insecticidal soaps are derived
from plant oils or animal fats and are allowed for use by organic
growers. Pyrethrin is considered a botanical pesticide, or a pesticide
derived from a naturally occurring plant source. Therefore, it
is an acceptable method of insect control in organic farming in
California, <I>provided it does not contain the synergist piperonyl
butoxide</I>. A soap/pyrethrin mix may be applied one time only
in late spring or early summer when temperatures, and thus insect
activity, increase. However, many organic growers use pyrethrin
and/or soap on a limited basis or as an emergency pest control
measure only. For one reason, grower experience indicates that
pyrethrin use will decrease the number of predatory mites and
beneficial insects in the vineyard. The exact application rate
and the number of acres treated will depend on the vineyard location
and the extensiveness of pest infestations. Leafhopper populations
may also be lessened when leaf removal operations are performed,
as some nymphs (young leafhoppers) will be removed at the same
time. Also, coverage by the pyrethrin and/or soap spray in the
fruit zone will be greater when the vine canopy is opened. Growers
should be certain that any materials used are in compliance with
the rules and regulations of state and third party organic certification
agencies. (Refer to the <B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B>
section.)
<P>
Many beneficial arthropods, such as parasites and predators, occur
naturally within organic vineyards. When the parasitic wasp, <I>Anagrus
epos</I>, is present in vineyards, it can be helpful in controlling
the grape leafhopper (<I>Erythroneura elegantula)</I>. However,
<I>A. epos </I>requires an overwintering habitat with alternate
hosts to survive in or near vineyards on a year-round basis. Research
indicates that refuges, which can occur naturally (wild blackberries)
or are planted (prune trees), harbor alternate host leafhoppers
and may therefore attract and sustain this parasitic wasp during
the winter. When these plants are growing in or near the vineyard,
parasite activity will usually be higher earlier in the spring.
It should be noted that blackberries and other plant species growing
in neighboring riparian areas can also serve as a host to sharpshooter
leafhoppers, which are vectors of Pierce's Disease. Predaceous
arthropods such as spiders, lacewings, and lady beetles can also
lessen overall insect pest damage within the vineyard and should
therefore be encouraged to proliferate by providing an appropriate
habitat (cover crops) and avoiding insect and dormant sprays whenever
possible.
<P>
Vineyard weeds are most often controlled by discing or mowing
centers and by cultivation with a French plow (or a comparable
implement) in the vine rows. Hand weeding is often used in addition
to mechanical cultivations as a means of vine row weed control.
The number of mechanical cultivations, mowings and/or hand weedings
may vary among growers. Therefore, production costs may also vary.
Some growers are currently using or experimenting with flame weed
control in the vine rows. Weeds are not actually burned back;
the plant's cells burst upon exposure to the high temperatures
a flame weeder produces. This practice essentially kills and eliminates
the targeted plants. A few growers are also testing the &quot;mow
and move&quot; approach, where cover crop clippings are deposited
under the vine row to suppress weed growth.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>As of January 1, 1992 all growers of organic commodities must
register on a yearly basis with the State of California under
the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, AB 2012. Enforced under
this act are the provisions of Article 4.5 (commencing with Section
26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21 of the California Health
and Safety Code. These provisions contain rules and regulations
which must be adhered to by all producers and handlers of organic
commodities. State law requires that growers follow the necessary
guidelines for at least 12 months prior to becoming organic. State
registration fees are levied based on the previous year's gross
sales. Fees are payable before any sales of the commodity occur.
<P>
In addition to state registration, some growers may choose to
be certified by a third party certification agency. Third party
agencies were formed to set forth and monitor standards for organic
production. Before state laws began to govern organic commodities,
third party agencies were often the only means to verify that
products were, in fact, organically grown. Third party organizations
must adhere to all state laws regulating organic commodities,
and in addition may enforce standards and procedures specific
to their own agencies. Differences between organizations may also
occur in the certification process and the associated costs. Farm
advisors in your area of interest may be able to provide additional
information or assistance.
<P>
California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) is one of a number
of third party organizations in the United States which can certify
organic growers within the State of California. CCOF adheres to
the standards of the California Organic Foods Act of 1990 as well
as its own procedures and standards. Certification by CCOF is
voluntary. CCOF currently requires a three year transition period
when converting from conventional production practices to organically
acceptable methods.
<P>
On October 1, 1993, the federal Organic Foods Production Act of
1990 was to become effective. However, due to budget constraints,
implementation of the law will be delayed for at least one year.
When implemented, the act will regulate all organic commodities
on the national level and will preempt state law where state law
is less stringent than federal law. The Secretary of Agriculture
has appointed a National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to make
recommendations for implementing the law, including the compilation
of a national materials list. This list will indicate which agricultural
materials are permissible and which are prohibited in organic
agriculture on the national level. The original directive of the
Organic Foods Production Act stated that organic growers did not
need to register on the federal level. Growers were, however,
to be certified by a third party certification agency or a state
agency. This requirement was to be different from, and in addition
to, California state registration. Because of budget cuts and
implementation changes, organic grower's registration requirements
may be different than the original directive when the law is finally
enacted. Therefore, organic growers and other interested parties
should use this information as a guideline only. To comply with
the federal law in its current form, growers making the change
from conventional to organic must complete a three year transitional
period. This means that growers within California must already
be in transition to be certified organic on the federal level
by the law's anticipated implementation in 1994.
<P>
<U><B>Organic Production Versus Organic Processing</B></U>:<BR>
California has seen a substantial increase in acreage dedicated
to the production of organic wine grapes in the last two years.
In 1990 CCOF reported that wine grape acreage certified organic
or pending certification totaled 5,816 acres. By 1991 this figure
had increased to 10,120. Because this figure does not necessarily
include all state registered growers, it may represent only a
portion of the total organic acreage. However, it is the only
data currently available.
<P>
California currently follows the standards and guidelines of the
Organic Foods Act of 1990 to regulate processed organic products,
including organic wine. At issue in the winemaking process is
the matter of naturally occurring versus added sulfites. Sulfites
are naturally produced at extremely low levels during the wine
fermentation process (generally 10 parts per millions (ppm) or
less). Also, sulfites are normally added during wine processing
to decrease the risk of oxidation and microbial spoilage. Under
the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, sulfite additives are
prohibited. Therefore, wines with added sulfites may not be labeled
organic by California state law regardless of whether or not the
wine grapes used in processing were organically grown. However,
these wines may claim to be processed from organically grown wine
grapes. When no sulfites are added, but do occur naturally, wines
may be labeled organic under California state law provided all
regulations governing organic commodities are adhered to and that
100% organically grown wine grapes are used. Organic wines currently
represent only a very small segment of the market.
<P>
In addition to state rules and regulations, the United States
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) mandates that
any wine that contains greater than 10 ppm sulfites be labeled
as a product that contains sulfites. The maximum level of sulfites
currently allowed in any wine by the BATF is 350 ppm.
<P>
An organization of wine grape growers, winemakers, distributors,
and wholesalers, the Organic Grapes Into Wine Alliance, is currently
addressing the issue of organic wine standards on the federal
level with the NOSB. The alliance would like to develop a standard
definition of organic wine, and to develop minimum standards by
which organic wines can be processed, including the limitation
and regulation of sulfites. Federal standards for processed organic
foods and wines are targeted for enactment in late 1994. It is
not yet clear how this will ultimately affect California legislation
governing organic wines. However, the alliance hopes that eventually
standards will be initiated on both state and federal levels which
are in alignment with international regulations, thus enabling
trade throughout the United States and the world.<BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="assumptions">Assumptions</A> For Producing
Organic Wine Grapes<BR>
In The North Coast<BR>
<I>With Resident Vegetation</I> </CENTER></H3>

<P>
This study reflects the practices and costs associated with a
production system for organically grown wine grapes in the North
Coast region of California. While every effort is made to model
a production system based on real world practices, this report
cannot fully represent the costs and practices that are specific
to each vineyard, or the variations that exist between the four
counties which comprise this region. Therefore, this study should
be interpreted as a representative operation and not as a statistical
average.
<P>
The vineyard in this report is assumed to have been established
as a conventional vineyard for wine grape production. It is considered
to have completed the transition period and is registered and
certified as organic. Changing a farming system from conventional
to organic practices requires a transition period. State and third
party certification agency rules and regulations which are specific
to organic commodities must be adhered to during this time period.
Crops grown in transition years may not be sold or labeled as
organic. Commodities that are produced organically can often be
sold for a higher price than conventionally grown products. However,
few pricing premiums for organic wine grapes currently exist.
<P>
The following is a description of general assumptions pertaining
to sample costs for organic wine grape production with resident
vegetation in the North Coast region. The costs are based on common
practices used by local growers and may not be applicable to all
situations. Production practices and vineyard management techniques
are generally individualized to meet the specific needs of each
grower. These costs are represented on an annual per acre basis.
<P>
<B>1. <U>LAND</U>:<BR>
</B>The total vineyard size is 37 acres. Land is owned by the
grower and is valued at $13,000 per acre. This figure is within
the low and high ranges of values for undeveloped land with vineyard
potential for the four counties that comprise this region. Land
costs per acre will vary within the region and within each county.
Land is not depreciated.<B> </B>Land is assumed to be level, with
well drained soils of moderate depth and fertility. The following
table shows the range of values for land suitable for vineyards
in each county.<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>
<B>2. <U>VINEYARD ESTABLISHMENT</U></B>: <BR>
The establishment cost is the sum of the costs for the land preparation,
trellis system, planting, vines, cash overhead and production
expenses for growing the vines through the first year that grapes
are harvested (year three). The vineyard establishment cost is
used to determine the non-cash overhead expenses, depreciation
and interest on investment during the production years. (For more
detailed information on this cost refer to the companion study
<I><B>Sample Costs To Establish A Vineyard And Produce Wine Grapes
In Sonoma County - 1992</B></I>).
<P>
<B>3. <U>VINES</U>:<BR>
</B>Grape variety is not specified in this study. Vines are planted
on a 7' x 11' spacing with 566 vines per acre. Vines are cordon
trained and spur pruned. The vineyard life is assumed to be 22
years beyond three establishment years.
<P>
<B>4. <U>TRELLIS SYSTEM</U>:<BR>
</B>A vertical shoot positioned trellis is utilized with a five
wire design; a lower, or fruiting wire, and two pair of movable
wires above. Wires are attached to lodgepoles which are placed
at every fourth vine. The drip irrigation line is attached to
the permanent (lower) wire. The movable wires are adjusted three
times (May, June and July) during the growing season to accommodate
vine and grape growth.
<P>
<B>5. <U>DRIP IRRIGATION</U>:<BR>
</B>Water for the drip irrigation system is pumped from a depth
of 150 feet in a 200 foot well using a 10 horsepower (hp) pump.
Pressure at the discharge head is 35 pounds per square inch (psi)
and produces a flow of 125 gallons per minute (gpm). The cost
for the drip irrigation system includes the 10 hp pump, the filtration
system, all drip lines, emitters and labor charges for installation.
In addition, 100% of the cost to refurbish the well is included
in the cost of the drip irrigation system. The irrigation system
has a 25 year lifespan, is an improvement to the property, and
is therefore included in <A HREF="#table4"><B>Table 4 </B></A>as
an investment.
<P>
The amount of drip irrigation water applied for crop growth is
assumed to be 400 gallons per vine per year or approximately two-thirds
of an acre-foot per acre. The amount of water applied through
the drip system to irrigate the vines relates to the vineyard
floor management practices. Resident vegetation will complete
with vines for soil moisture. Therefore, additional water must
be applied to vines. (See the <B>cover crop</B> section below).
The pumping cost for irrigation water is estimated at $23.40 per
acre-foot. This vineyard is irrigated with the drip system between
May and August.
<P>
<B>6. <U>OVERHEAD SPRINKLERS/FROST PROTECTION</U>: <BR>
</B>In this study, an overhead sprinkler system is used for frost
protection and for postharvest irrigation. The entire system consists
of a 20 acre-foot reservoir, a 1500 gpm pump powered by a diesel
engine, a permanent underground pipeline, and solid set sprinklers.
Water for the indicated operation is pumped from the well into
the reservoir and stored there until needed. This system has an
expected 25 year life, is considered an improvement to the property,
and is therefore included as an investment in <A HREF="#table4"><B>Table 4.</B></A>
<P>
Three inches of water per acre is applied for the postharvest
irrigation. Frost protection is assumed to be necessary 12 nights
per year at six hours per night. Each frost protection application
is equal to approximately one-half inch of water per night per
acre. Frost protection takes place over the period from March
through May. Annual water application through this system on all
37 acres is 19.70 acre-feet total for the postharvest irrigation
and for frost protection. The cost of the water for overhead sprinkler
operations is $51.00 per acre-foot. The cost difference between
water for drip irrigation and for sprinklers is due to the extra
pumping required to move the water from the reservoir through
the overhead sprinklers. These figures are within a range of use
and costs for the North Coast and will vary among the counties.
<P>
<B>7.</B> <U><B>YIELD &amp; RETURN RANGES FOR ORGANIC WINE GRAPES</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>For the hypothetical vineyard in this study no pricing premium
is assumed. Net returns above total costs are positive at a price
for grapes of $1,000 per ton when yields reach 4.25 tons per acre.
For prices at or below $500 per ton and for yields at or below
9 tons per acre, it is not profitable to produce organic wine
grapes. At a high price of $1,700 per ton, the breakeven yield
is 2.4 tons per acre. A ranging analysis for varying yields and
prices is shown in <A HREF="#table6"><B>Table 6</B></A>.
<P>
<B>8. <U>PRODUCTION PRACTICES</U>: <BR>
</B>Production practices in this study are listed in <A HREF="#table1"><B>Table 1</B></A>.
This table shows the order in which the operations are performed,
as well as the hours per acre required for each operation. Labor
and custom rates, material and fuel and repair costs are also
included in this table. In addition, <A HREF="#table3"><B>Table 3 </B></A>shows
the monthly cash costs and sequence of operations.
<P>
To increase soil tilth, fertility, and nutrient availability,
some soil amendments are applied to the organic vineyard analyzed
in this study, as shown in the following table. Soil amendments
are added if warranted by appropriate tissue and soil sampling.
<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Chart not available<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
<B>9. <U>COVER CROPS</U>:<BR>
</B>In this study, resident vegetation is managed as the cover
crop. No yearly planting or irrigation to germinate the cover
crop is required. Resident vegetation is often dominated by grasses,
mustards and malva, but can include other broadleaf plants. The
cover crop is mowed three times yearly in April, May and June
to control flushes of weed growth. Because resident vegetation
dies back in the warm summer months, little or no management is
needed during this time.
<P>
<B>10. <U>PEST MANAGEMENT</U>:<BR>
</B>The incidence of disease, as well as invertebrate and vertebrate
pest damage is assumed to be low. However, some treatments are
commonly used to minimize pest damage. The following table indicates
the pest management techniques used in this study.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Chart not available<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Because many beneficial arthropods occur naturally within organic
vineyards, costs for release or augmentation of parasites and
predators are not considered in this study. Weeds in the vineyard
centers are controlled by discing. A French plow is used to cultivate
vine row weeds. Hand weeding is used in the vine rows in addition
to mechanical cultivations. No other means of weed control are
used in this report.
<P>
<B>11. <U>HARVEST</U>:<BR>
</B>Harvest operations are performed by a custom operator at a
cost of $120 per ton. This rate reflects the cost for hand harvesting.
This study assumes that harvest takes place in the month of September.
<P>
For more information on custom harvesting contact the farm advisor
or companies contracting for grapes in the area of interest. If
growers choose to do their own harvesting, equipment for the required
operations should be inventoried and labor, fuel, repairs, depreciation
and interest on investment should be added as a cost of production
to <B>Tables <A HREF="#table1"><B>1</B></A> </B>and <A HREF="#table3"><B>3</B></A>.
Custom charges, then, would not be included.
<P>
<B>12. <U>LABOR</U>:<BR>
</B>Basic hourly wages for workers are $8.00 and $6.00 per hour
for machine operators and field workers, respectively. Adding
34% for SDI, FICA, insurance and other benefits increases the
labor rates shown to $10.72 per hour for machine labor and $8.04
per hour for non-machine labor. The labor hours for operations
involving machinery are 20% higher than operation time to account
for extra labor involved in equipment set-up, moving, maintenance
and repair. Wages for managers are not included as a cash cost.
Any returns above total costs are considered returns to management
and risk.<BR>

<P>
<B>13. <U>INVESTMENT</U>:<BR>
</B>The investments shown in <A HREF="#table4"><B>Table 4</B> </A>are
those that are allocated to the entire vineyard. The totals in
<A HREF="#table4"><B>Table 4</B> </A>are used for the costs in
<B>Tables <A HREF="#table2"><B>2</B></A>, <A HREF="#table4"><B>4</B></A>
</B>and<B> <A HREF="#table6"><B>6</B></A>. </B>Annual investments
shown in <A HREF="#table1"><B>Table 1</B> </A>represent depreciation
and opportunity cost for each investment on an annual per acre
basis.
<P>
<B>14. <U>BUSINESS OVERHEAD</U></B>: <BR>
County taxes are calculated as 1% of the average value of equipment,
buildings and improvements. Property insurance is charged at 0.5%
of the average value of all assets over their useful life. Liability
insurance covers accidents on the farm and costs $300 per year.
Office and business costs are estimated at $250 per acre for the
farm. These expenses include office supplies, telephones, bookkeeping,
accounting, legal fees, road preparation and maintenance. Leaf
and soil analyses are included at $4 per acre.
<P>
<B>15. <U>ASSESSMENTS</U>:<BR>
</B>In this study, a stepped scale organic grower's registration
fee of $300 is assessed by the State of California on the gross
sales amount of $175,750. The fee is calculated by multiplying
the yield (4.75 tons per acre) by the price received ($1,000 per
ton) and the number of acres (37). This is only an estimate of
potential fees and will vary depending on yields and returns.
Contact the County Agricultural Commissioner in your area for
further details.
<P>
The grower is assumed to be certified by California Certified
Organic Farmers (CCOF). CCOF adheres to the standards of the California
Organic Foods Act of 1990 as well as its own specific procedures
and standards. Certification by CCOF is voluntary. Before January
1, 1992, CCOF required a one year transition period when converting
from conventional production practices to organically acceptable
methods. The requirement is now three years. Annual membership
fees are $125. Inspection fees are $115. An assessment fee of
0.5% of gross sales, or $879, is included as a cost of production.
These fees are specific to this study. Fees are based on the number
of acres and parcels contained in an operation as well as whether
or not the farm is totally organic. Therefore, individual situations
may vary.
<P>
<B>16. <U>INTEREST</U>:<BR>
</B>Interest on operating capital is based on a short term interest
rate charged against cash costs and is calculated monthly until
harvest at a nominal interest rate of 9% per year. Interest is
also charged on investment at a real interest rate of 4% per year
to account for income foregone that could be received from an
alternative investment (opportunity cost) and is calculated using
a long term interest rate charged on the average value of the
land, improvements to the property and equipment. A real interest
rate indicates the return for the use of capital and does not
include any adjustment for inflation. A nominal interest rate
would include an inflation factor.
<P>
<B>17. <U>EQUIPMENT COSTS</U>:<BR>
</B>In allocating the equipment costs per acre, the following
calculations were made and shown in <A HREF="#table5"><B>Table 5</B></A>:
(a) <B>Original Cost</B> of equipment is the cost of the new equipment
plus sales tax. (b) <B>Depreciation</B> is straight line with
a 10% salvage value. (c) <B>Interest</B> on investment is calculated
as the average value per acre of the equipment during its useful
life multiplied by a real interest rate of 4%. Average value per
acre equals new cost plus salvage value divided by 2 then divided
by the number of acres. (d) The <B>Total Investment Costs</B>
are calculated as 60% of the depreciation and the interest costs
for all new equipment to reflect a mix of the new and used equipment.
These values are also used in <B>Table <A HREF="#table1"><B>1</B></A>,
<A HREF="#table4"><B>4</B></A>, and <A HREF="#table6"><B>6</B></A>.
All of this equipment is used on the entire 37 acre vineyard.
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>18. <U>FUEL &amp; REPAIR</U>: <BR>
</B>The fuel and repair cost per acre for each operation in <A HREF="#table1"><B>Table 1 </B></A>is
determined by multiplying the total hourly operating cost for
each piece of equipment in <A HREF="#table5"><B>Table 5</B> </A>by
the number of hours per acre for that operation. Prices for on-farm
delivery of gasoline and diesel are $0.98 and $0.71 per gallon,
respectively.

<H3><A NAME="Overview">OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC RICE PRODUCTION</A>
<BR>
IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>This study reflects the practices and costs associated with
an intensive production system for organically grown rice. Total
farm size is 600 acres. Each year one rice crop is grown on 300
acres, while the remaining 300 acres are planted to a cover crop
for rotation and fertility purposes. It is significant that growers
total yearly returns are based on utilizing half their available
land base. This management decision requires a financial commitment
during years of transition from conventional to organic production
as well as in years when yields and returns fluctuate. Rice produced
in transition years cannot be sold as organic and therefore cannot
take advantage of potential organic pricing premiums. Pricing
premiums for organic commodities are dependent on market demand
as well as the amount of production in any given year and are
fragile in nature.
<P>
<U><B>Risk</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>The risks associated with organic rice production should not
be minimized. While this study makes every effort to model a production
system based on real world practices, it cannot fully represent
financial, yield and market risks which affect the profitability
and economic viability of organically grown commodities.
<P>
In organic rice production, yields can vary substantially from
year to year and field to field. Depending on growing conditions,
yields of organic rice can range from 12 cwt (hundredweight) to
80 cwt per acre on a dry weight basis. Average yields of organically
grown rice are generally less than that of conventionally grown
rice.
<P>
Fewer total acres are planted to organic rice in the Sacramento
Valley than that of conventionally grown rice. Because of this,
organic rice production is not considered standard practice and
can be considered a specialty crop. Access to a market is therefore
crucial to the success of the enterprise. A marketing strategy
should be formulated and contract be secured before an organic
rice enterprise is undertaken.
<P>
<U><B>Production Practices</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Variation in production practices exists among growers of
organic rice. Practices utilized are those which are most effective
in individual situations. There are two representative methods
of growing organic rice in the Sacramento Valley. They are: (1)
<I>water seeded</I>, and (2) <I>no-till drill seeded</I>. Differences
in the two methods occur in operations and costs incurred for
land preparation and each rice planting.
<P>
In method #1, <I>water sown rice</I>, costs are incurred for additional
discing of fields and preparation of the final seedbed. Levees
are pulled, and fields are flooded with approximately 6&quot;
of water prior to seed being flown on. A seeding rate of 150 pounds
per acre is used. A third discing may be necessary every third
year depending on the density of the vetch crop and weeds. Costs
for the third discing are not included in this report.
<P>
In method #2, <I>no-till drilled seed</I>, after the vetch cover
crop is chopped, rice seed is drilled directly into the vetch
residue. This residue acts as a mulch for shade and weed control.
A seeding rate of 135 pounds per acre is used. Rental costs of
$10.50 per acre for a non-tillage drill are added. Levees are
pulled after seeding takes place. If the soil profile has insufficient
moisture for seed germination and stand establishment, fields
must be flushed once or twice with 3-4&quot; of water prior to
permanent flooding.
<P>
In both methods laser leveling occurs in one out of every four
years. Land planing occurs in the other three years.
<P>
Variation in total water usage between methods #1 and #2 is negligible.
Water costs are included at $35 per acre. This figure is within
a range of use and costs for this production region. Water costs
can vary substantially and are dependent on the use of district
(surface) or pumped (well) water.
<P>
Harvest operations are identical in both methods. Typically after
harvest, rice straw is left to decompose in fields in years when
a cover crop is grown. Depending on soil conditions and the practices
of individual growers, some incorporation of rice straw using
corrugated rollers or discs may be done.
<P>
<U><B>Cover Crops and Rotations</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>An integral component of organic rice production is rotation
to a cover crop. The predominant cover crop used is purple vetch.
Other species such as woollypod vetch and common vetch are occasionally
planted. The cover crop is grown to provide nitrogen for crop
production and return organic matter to soils. These additions
can benefit the subsequent crop as well as provide a long-term
contribution to soil quality. Cover crops can also be harvested
for seed.
<P>
Depending on field conditions, vetch seed can be drilled or flown
on in the fall after the rice harvest. Seed can be drilled in
years when fields are dry enough to support farm equipment. Seed
can also be flown on in dry years. In either case, fields are
disced to cover the seed and to help incorporate the rice stubble.
Grower experience indicates that this discing can enhance cover
crop establishment. In years when ground is wet and cannot be
worked with farm machinery, vetch seed is flown on. No discing
occurs to cover the seed or to incorporate the rice stubble. In
this study, vetch seed is assumed to be flown onto fields which
cannot be worked. Costs for discing are therefore not included
in this report.
<P>
Vetch germination and growth is dependent on fall and winter rains.
This report assumes that the cover crop is not irrigated. Vetch
growth continues through the spring when flowering and seed set
occurs. Seed is harvested in the summer. During harvest, the vetch
cover crop reseeds itself as pods shatter and seeds are scattered
across the field. Additional vetch seed may be planted in the
fall of the second year if the seed distribution or germination
was poor. The costs of this study reflect one vetch planting only.
The second (self-reseeded) vetch crop is allowed to grow only
through the spring when it is chopped and incorporated into the
soil (<I>water sown</I>) or just chopped, and left as residue
on the surface (<I>no-till drilled seed</I>). Rice is then planted
in the spring and harvested the next October. Please see <B>Figure
A </B>at the end of this section for a schematic representation
of a typical rice-purple vetch two year rotation.
<P>
Historically, purple vetch was grown for seed in rotation with
rice to satisfy an export market. Although an export market for
vetch seed no longer exists, purple vetch continues to be grown
on some rice lands, largely due to increased interest in cover
and green manure crops. Vetch harvests generally yield an average
of 600 pounds of seed per acre. In this study, only 60 pounds
of vetch seed is used on-farm for planting vetch in year one of
the two year rotation. Clean or field-run vetch seed in excess
of growers needs can be sold for additional income, however, is
not shown as revenue in this study. Although there is a fairly
consistent market for vetch seed, price can fluctuate depending
on supply. Prices for vetch seed to growers currently range anywhere
from $0.25 to $0.50 per pound.
<P>
Although the use of purple vetch as a winter annual cover crop
is common among growers of organic rice, it is not the only option.
Growers in some areas may find that this particular cover crop
is not appropriate to their soils and conditions and may choose
to plant a different nitrogen fixing crop. These can include bell
beans and some clovers. While these cover crops add organic matter
and nitrogen to soils, they are not necessarily suited to seed
production and may be incorporated each spring prior to planting
a cash crop. Alternatively, manures can be applied in the spring
prior to planting to increase nutrient availability for rice production,
particularly on ground without sufficient fertility. Poultry manures
are typically used. Composting of manures is suggested to destroy
weed seeds. Contact your local farm advisor for specific advice
in your area.
<P>
In some areas of the Sacramento Valley, crop rotations in organic
rice production include both a cover crop and an alternate cash
crop. Yellow corn, popcorn, oats, wheat, beans and processing
tomatoes are some of the crops that can be grown in alternate
years between spring-incorporated and fall-planted cover crops.
Diversification of crops can reduce economic risks, make full
use of nutrients throughout the soil profile and control certain
pests. The major considerations for farmers in choosing to rotate
crops are: (1) the timing and compatibility of the alternate crop's
growing season with rice and the cover crop, (2) the equipment
requirements of the alternate crop, and (3) the feasibility of
growing the alternate crop organically, both in terms of production
practices and finding a market for the commodity.<BR>

<A NAME="figA"><B><I>Figure A is not available online.</I><BR></B></A>
<BR>

<P>
<U><B>Pest Management</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Pesticides that are currently employed by conventional rice
growers are not used by certified producers of organic rice. However,
certain materials with pesticidal properties may be used in organic
rice production. An example of this is the use of copper sulfate
for algae control. In this study the incidence of disease, as
well as vertebrate and invertebrate pest damage is assumed to
be low enough that no specific control action is taken. Individual
situations may vary. Weed control presents the greatest challenge
to growers of organic rice. Ground that does not have a history
of rice production may escape large weed populations initially.
While the interval between rice crops assists in breaking the
cycle of pests in general, broadleaf weeds, water grasses and
sedges are all problems with long term organic rice production.
Some techniques to control weeds are:
<OL>
<LI>Summer flood to sprout grass and aquatic weed seeds. Subsequent
cultivations and winter frosts decrease weed incidence.
<LI>Screen weed seeds from ditch irrigation water. This may not
be practical in all situations.
<LI>Compost any manures used in production.
<LI>Hold deep water (7-8&quot;) to control the grasses and some
sedges such as smallflower umbrellaplant. Monitoring is necessary
for optimum seedling establishment.
<LI>Use sheep to graze weeds in levee areas. Fence rental or purchase
will be necessary.
<LI>Sanitize equipment when moving from field to field.
<LI>Rotation of crops in alternate years. 
</OL>

<P>
To further alleviate weed pressure, growers can vary production
practices between <I>water seeded</I> and <I>no-till drill seeded</I>
rice to control specific weeds that are prevalent in each method.
For example, rice field bulrush may be suppressed by <I>drill
seeding</I>; grasses in <I>water seeding</I> by deep water management.
Although eradication is generally not possible, many techniques
can lessen the impact of weeds.
<P>
<U><B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>As of January 1, 1992 all growers of organic commodities must
register on a yearly basis with the State of California under
the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, AB 2012. Enforced under
this act are the provisions of Article 4.5 (commencing with Section
26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21 of the California Health
and Safety Code. These provisions contain rules and regulations
which must be adhered to by all producers and handlers of organic
commodities.
<P>
Registration fees are levied by the State of California and are
based on the previous year's gross sales. These fees are payable
before any sales of the commodity occur. In this study a stepped
scale fee of $450 is assessed on a gross sales amount of $262,500.
This is calculated by multiplying a yield of 50 cwt per acre by
a price of $17.50 per cwt and the number of rice producing acres
(300). This is only an estimate of potential fees and will vary
depending on yields and returns. Contact the County Agricultural
Commissioner in your area for further details.
<P>
In addition to state registration, some growers may choose to
be certified by a third party organic certification agency. Third
party agencies were formed to set forth and monitor standards
for organic production. Before state laws began to govern organic
commodities, third party agencies were often the only means to
verify that products were, in fact, organically grown. California
Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) is one of a number of third party
organizations in the United States and is not the only option
for certification within the State of California. Differences
between organizations may occur in the certification process,
associated costs, standards and procedures. Farm advisors in your
area of interest may be able to provide additional information
or assistance.
<P>
This study assumes that growers participate in, and are certified
by, CCOF. CCOF adheres to the standards of the California Organic
Foods Act of 1990 as well as its own specific procedures and standards.
Certification by CCOF is voluntary. Before January 1, 1992, CCOF
required a one year certification transition period when converting
from conventional production practices to organically acceptable
methods. The requirement is now three years. Annual membership,
inspection and assessment fees are charged as cash overhead costs.
Annual membership fees in this study are $175. Inspection fees
are $100. An assessment fee of 0.5% of gross sales, or $1,313,
is also shown as a cash overhead cost. These fees are specific
to this study and will vary depending on the number of acres and
parcels contained in an operation as well as whether or not the
farm is totally organic. For information on each individual situation,
refer to CCOF's current Certification Handbook.
<P>
<U><B>Government Programs</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Federal farm programs under the 1990 Farm Bill may warrant
consideration by individual growers of organic rice. These programs
may provide benefits and coincide with the management and production
practices of an intensive organic rice system. Income from government
programs is not included in this study. However, the two year
rotation facilitates participation by allowing growers to meet
the diverted acreage requirement. Participation in the programs
will require research and decision making on the part of individual
growers. Contact the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS) for inquiries.<BR>

<U><B>U.C. Cooperative Extension</B></U></B></U>
<P>
The following is a description of some general assumptions pertaining
to sample costs of organic rice production in selected counties
of Northern California. These costs are represented on a per acre
basis.
<P>
<B>1. <U>LAND</U>:<BR>
</B>This cost of production study is based on a 600 acre organic
rice operation which in any given year devotes 300 acres solely
to producing rice. The remainder of land is planted to a cover
crop for rotation and fertility purposes. Land in this study is
owned by the grower and is valued at $2,000 per acre. Land is
not depreciated.
<P>
<B>2. <U>CULTURAL PRACTICES</U>: <BR>
</B>Cultural practices for the production of organic rice vary
from grower to grower and region to region. The practices and
inputs used in this cost study serve only as a sample or guide.
Two representative methods for organic rice production occur in
the Sacramento Valley. They are: (1) <I>water seeded</I>, and
(2)<I>no-till drill seeded</I>.
<P>
In method #1, <I>water sown rice</I>, costs are incurred for additional
discing of fields and preparation of the final seedbed. Levees
are pulled and fields are flooded with approximately 6&quot; of
water prior to seed being flown on. A seeding rate of 150 pounds
per acre is used. A third discing may be necessary every third
year depending on the density of the vetch crop and weeds. Costs
for the third discing are not included in this report.
<P>
In method #2, <I>no-till drill seeded</I>, after the vetch is
chopped, rice seed is drilled directly into the vetch residue.
This residue acts as a mulch for shade and weed control. A seeding
rate of 135 pounds per acre is used. Rental costs of $10.50 per
acre for a non-tillage drill are added. Levees are pulled after
seeding takes place. If the soil profile has insufficient moisture
for seed germination and stand establishment, fields must be flushed
once or twice with 3-4&quot; of water prior to permanent flooding.
<P>
Variations can be significant. Please refer to the overview section
of this study for additional information or contact the farm advisor
in the county of interest.
<P>
<B>3.</B> <U><B>YIELD &amp; RETURN RANGES FOR ORGANIC RICE</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>The range of yields in the production region of this study
is 12 cwt (hundredweight) to 80 cwt per acre on a dry weight basis.
The range of prices received by growers for organically grown
rice is currently $14.50 to $20.00 per cwt. <B><A HREF="#table9">Table 9</A></B>, the
Ranging Analysis, shows net returns above operating costs, cash
costs, and total costs for various price and yield levels.
<P>
<I>Water-sown rice</I> shows positive net returns above total
costs with a minimum yield of 38 cwt per acre and a minimum price
of $17.50 per cwt. At a low price of $14.50 per cwt, the breakeven
yield is 47 cwt. At a high price of $20.00 per cwt, the breakeven
yield is 32 cwt.
<P>
In <I>no-till drilled rice</I>, net returns above total costs
are positive at yields at or above 38 cwt with a minimum price
of $16.50 per cwt. At a low price of $14.50 per cwt, the breakeven
yield is 44 cwt. At a high price of $20.00, the breakeven yield
is 31 cwt.
<P>
Market conditions will affect these figures. No government payments
are included in the returns of this study.<BR>

<P>
<B>4. <U>YIELD &amp; MARKET VALUES FOR VETCH</U> <U>SEED</U>:
<BR>
</B>In this study 60 pounds of vetch seed per acre is planted
for the first cover crop. The second cover crop is self-reseeded.
Because vetch seed is grown on-farm no value is shown. Vetch seed
in excess of growers needs may provide additional income, however
due to market supply and price inconsistency, is not included
in this study. The price range currently received by growers is
$0.25 to $0.50 per pound.
<P>
<B>5. <U>HARVEST</U>:<BR>
</B>In this cost study growers own their own harvesting equipment
and perform all of their own harvest operations. The equipment
for harvest operations is inventoried, and labor, fuel, repairs,
depreciation, and interest on investment are calculated as a cost
of production. If growers choose to contract their harvest operation,
all harvest equipment and the appropriate costs should be subtracted
and custom charges added to harvest costs in <B>Tables <A HREF="#table4">4</A> </B>and<B>
<A HREF="#table6">6</A>.</B>
<P>
<B>6. <U>LABOR</U>:<BR>
</B>Basic hourly wages for workers are $7.47 and $5.50 per hour
for machine operators and field workers, respectively. Adding
34% for SDI, FICA, insurance and other benefits increases the
labor rates shown to $10.00 per hour for machine labor and $7.37
per hour for non-machine labor. The labor hours for operations
involving machinery are 10% higher than the machine hours to account
for extra labor involved in equipment set-up, moving, maintenance
and repair. Wages for managers are not included as a cash cost.
Any returns above total costs are considered returns to management
and risk.
<P>
<B>7. <U>RICE CROP INVESTMENT</U>: <BR>
</B>The investments shown in <B><A HREF="#table7">Table 7</A></B> are those that are
allocated to the organic rice operation. Included in annual investments
is a yearly cover crop. The investment cost for the cover crop
is calculated by multiplying the total cash costs per acre to
produce vetch shown in <B>Tables <A HREF="#table1">1</A></B> and <B<A HREF="#table2">2</2> </B>by 300, or
the number of acres in the crop. Annual investments shown in <B>Tables
<A HREF="#table4">4</A></B> and<B> <A HREF="#table5">5</A></B> represent depreciation and opportunity cost
for each investment on an annual per acre basis.
<P>
<B>8. <U>COVER CROP INVESTMENT</U></B>: <BR>
The cost of producing a vetch cover crop is calculated in <B>Tables
<A HREF="#table4">1</A></B> and <B><A HREF="#table4">2</A> </B>and is<B> </B>shown as an investment allocated
to the 300 acre organic rice operation in <B>Table</B> <B><A HREF="#table7">7</A>.</B>
These costs can be thought of indirectly as the cost of producing
nitrogen and improving soil quality for the rice enterprise. This
is to better reflect the actual cost of organic rice production.
This investment is also shown on an annual per acre basis in <B>Tables
<A HREF="#table4">4</A></B>and <B><A HREF="#table5">5</A></B>.
<P>
<B>9. <U>OVERHEAD</U></B>: <BR>
County taxes are calculated as 1% of the average value of equipment,
buildings and improvements. Insurance is charged at 0.5% of the
average value of the equipment over its useful life. Office and
business costs are estimated at $20 per acre for the farm. These
expenses include office supplies, telephones, bookkeeping, accounting,
legal fees, road preparation and maintenance, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<B>10. <U>INTEREST</U>:<BR>
</B>Interest on operating capital is based on cash costs and is
calculated monthly (from October to July for vetch and from April
to November for rice) until the last harvest at the rate of 9%
per year. Adjustments for inflation are not included in this figure.
Interest is also charged on investment at a real interest rate
of 4% per year to account for income foregone that could be received
from an alternative investment (opportunity cost) and is based
on the average value of the buildings and equipment. The real
interest rate indicates the return for the use of capital and
does not include any adjustment for inflation.
<P>
<B>11. <U>EQUIPMENT COSTS</U>:<BR>
</B>In allocating the equipment costs per acre, the following
calculations were made and shown in <B><A HREF="#table7">Table 7</A></B>: (a) <B>Original
Cost</B> of equipment is the cost of the new equipment plus sales
tax. (b) <B>Depreciation</B> is straight line with a 10% salvage
value. (c) <B>Interest</B> on investment is calculated as the
average value per acre of the equipment during its useful life
multiplied by a real interest rate of 4%. Average value per acre
equals new cost plus salvage value divided by 2 divided by the
number of acres. (d) The <B>Total Investment Costs</B> are calculated
as 40% of the depreciation and the interest costs for all new
equipment to reflect a mix of the new and used equipment. These
values are also used in <B>Tables <A HREF="#table1">1</A></B> and<B> <A HREF="#table4">4</A>.</B> All of this
equipment is used on the entire 600 acre farm.
<P>
<B>12. <U>FUEL &amp; REPAIR</U>: <BR>
</B>The fuel and repair cost per acre for each operation in <B>Tables
<A HREF="#table1">1</A> </B>and<B> <A HREF="#table4">4</A> </B>is determined by multiplying the total hourly

<P>
Organic vegetable farms on the Central
Coast region of California are generally intensive operations.
 That is, two and sometimes three crops may be harvested off the
same acreage each year.  Many approaches exist for growing and
marketing organic vegetables.  This publication describes the
range of soil management practices, pest management, crop rotations,
cover crops, and harvest and packing methods currently used by
organic growers on the Central Coast of California.  Marketing
options and state and federal regulations governing organic commodities
are also discussed.  A general sequence of operations, equipment
requirements, resource use, costs, yield and return ranges are
presented for thirteen vegetable crops and two cover crops.  The
vegetables included are cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic,
lettuce (leaf and romaine), onions (red and yellow), snap peas,
snow peas, bell peppers (green and red), sweet corn, and winter
squash (large and small varieties).  Barley and vetch are the
two cover crops detailed.

<B>OVERVIEW OF PRODUCTION PRACTICES</B>
</CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
<B>Introduction</B>
<P>
The Central Coast region is one of
the most highly concentrated areas of organic vegetable production
in California.  The region's agricultural base, climate, proximity
to nearby urban areas, and access to a variety of market channels
has supported significant growth in this industry in recent years.
<P>
 There are many approaches and methods
for growing and marketing organic vegetables.  This overview is
meant to guide the reader through the critical topics and issues
that growers need to address.  Some of the most important variables
affecting the characteristics of a particular farm are its size,
soil type and fertility, available water resources, the selection
and rotation of crops, labor and equipment requirements, and market
options.  This narrative will highlight a number of different
organic vegetable crops and two cover crops currently grown on
the Central Coast.  They are: barley (cover crop), cabbage, cauliflower,
cucumbers, garlic, lettuce, onions, peas, peppers, sweet corn,
vetch (cover crop), and winter squash.  Additional crops are often
included in a grower's operation for greater diversification.
<P>
 The overview is divided into several
sections.  The first section describes the general sequence of
operations for the production of organic vegetables.  Following
this description, three additional sections provide more detail
about crop diversification and rotation, cover crops, and pest
management.  In the final two sections, we address the marketing
of organic vegetables and the current status of regulations governing
organic commodities.
<P>
<B>Production Practices</B>
<P>
Organic vegetable farms on the Central
Coast region of California are generally intensive operations.
 That is, two and sometimes three crops may be harvested off the
same acreage each year.  For each crop, cultural operations begin
with land preparation.  First, the soil is disced once or twice.
 After this initial discing, land is chiseled one or two times,
followed by one or two additional discings.  The number of passes
for each operation depends on the amount of residue of the previous
crop to be turned under as well as the tilth of the soil.  Land
leveling is not  performed on a yearly basis.
<P>
 Soil amendments such as manure,
composted manure, and gypsum are often spread by a custom operator
or by the grower during land preparation to manage soil fertility,
add soil organic matter, and increase nutrient levels for the
next crop.  Manure and composted manure can provide nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium for crop production.  Gypsum adds calcium
and sulfur for crop production and can be used to improve soil
tilth with soils high in sodium.  Soil amendments are generally
added if warranted by appropriate sampling.  In addition, grower
experience, cropping sequence, and cost will help determine the
material to be used as well as the exact application rate.  Other
soil fertility management techniques include crop diversification,
rotation, and cover cropping.
<P>
 After the ground has been worked
and any soil amendments added, beds are listed.  Depending upon
management technique and equipment complement, this operation
is either done by the grower or by a custom operator.  Weed seeds
that have been brought to the surface during the ground work are
germinated with a preplant irrigation.  A subsequent preplant
cultivation reduces or eliminates these weeds.  A variety of implements
may be used; rolling cultivators and sled-type cultivators are
most common.
<P>
 Following these practices, beds
are shaped and a vegetable crop planted.  Bed size can range from
30 to 60 inches from furrow to furrow depending on the crop to
be planted and the desired plant density.  A grower's equipment
com-plement may also factor into the decision of bed size.  Central
Coast organic vegetable producers commonly plant on 40-inch beds.
 Vegetable crops are direct seeded, hand planted, or machine transplanted
depending upon the crop itself, the time of year, the crop's ability
to compete with weeds, and the targeted market.  If it is available,
organic growers must purchase and plant seed that has not been
fungicide-treated.  Under organic regulations, seed that has been
insecticide-treated may not be used.  Transplants must be grown
in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990 in
addition to specific organic certification rules and regulations
(where applicable).  For additional information, refer to the
Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities section.
<P>
 Initial land preparation is similar
for most crops.  After this time, the di-versification of crops
necessitates that a number of different production practices be
utilized by organic growers.  Figure 1 includes information on
various planting methods, irrigation, pest management practices,
and harvest and packing methods for several different organic
vegetable crops currently grown in the Central Coast.  The grower's
experience and management style, soil type, the existing pest
complex, and each crop's unique cultural requirements factor into
the variation.  For example, the number of mechanical cultivations
for each crop can range from two to seven depending on the planted
crop and weed densities.  Pest management materials may be applied
to some vegetable crops for pest reduction and/or control; other
crops may not require any applications.  In addition, harvest
and packing methods may vary depending on a grower's labor and
equipment complement, as well as whether or not any packing facilities
are available.
<P>
 The irrigation delivery method,
number of applications, and total irrigation amount varies depending
on specific crop requirements, soil type, the amount of water
stored in the soil profile, and water availability.  A crop's
rooting depth and growing season greatly affect the water needs.
 For example, shallow rooted crops and crops grown over the summer
months generally require more frequent irrigation than deeper
rooted crops or crops grown in the winter months.  Soils with
high levels of organic matter may be better able to retain moisture
and therefore decrease the amount of applied water.  Furrow or
sprinkler irrigation is most often used by organic vegetable growers
in the Central Coast.  Surface and subsurface drip irrigation
systems may also be used by some growers, however these systems
require a larger capital investment initially.
<P>
<B>Crop Diversification and Rotation</B>
<P>
Crop diversification and rotation
are essential elements of organic vegetable operations.  Diversification
can enhance economic stability by allowing the risks of production
agriculture to be spread over a greater number of crops.  Ideally,
the crop mix should be complementary in nature; that is, all practices
should be performed in a timely manner without competition for
labor, equipment, and management expertise.  In reality, this
may not always be possible because of factors beyond a grower's
control, such as unusual weather conditions, pest infestations,
or peak work periods.  Diversification may also mean that a grower
will need additional resources such as specialized farm machinery.
<P>
 Rotations are characterized by cropping
sequences that alternate a variety of vegetable crops and often
include a cover or green manure crop.  Because of the importance
of soil fertility and soil organic matter, organic vegetable growers
are increasingly planting some acreage to cover crops.  A crop
rotation's purpose is to continually recycle nutrients, break
pest cycles, and maintain a balance between soil organic matter
accumulation and decomposition.  Organic matter is particularly
important for improving soil structure and water holding capacity,
and for providing nitrogen and other nutrients for crop production.
<P>
 Individual organic vegetable growers
may have differing strategies for planting and rotating a variety
of crops.  Cropping history and grower experience will factor
into the determination of each year's rotation.  Other considerations
include:
<P>
1. The ease of each crop's cultivation.
<P>
2. The compatibility of each crop
in terms of labor, equipment, and seasonal timing.
<P>
3. The availability of nutrients.
 Crops with greater nutrient requirements may produce higher yields
when following a cover crop or a crop with lower nutrient needs.
 Also, crops with different root growth patterns may be better
able to utilize residual nutrients that a previous crop was unable
to capture.
<P>
4. The existing pest complex including
weeds, disease, and arthropods (insects, spiders and mites). 
Selection of a crop that competes well with weeds, or planting
disease-resistant cultivars may help overcome some of these difficulties.
<P>
5. The crop value and access to markets.
<P>
6. The ability to provide year-round
employment for farm workers. 
<P>
Additionally, most growers will nor
plant related crop species on the same acreage in the same year.
Often this rule is extended for longer periods of time depending
on the specific vegetable crop and cropping history.  However,
when production land is high in value or when growers use limited
rotations, some crops (most commonly lettuce) may be grown back-to-back
on the same land.
<P>
 Figure 2 includes information on
a rotation plan for several different organic vegetable crops
currently produced on the Central Coast.  Although not shown in
the figure, a number of different rotation schemes are feasible,
including staggered plantings.  For example, crops such as cabbage,
cauliflower, lettuce, and sweet corn may not be planted on large
acreages, but rather in smaller blocks on a weekly basis.  Staggered
plantings are noteworthy in that they enable growers to harvest
over a greater period of time; markets therefore receive a more
consistent supply.  Staggered plantings may also mitigate the
effects of market gluts that can result in lower returns for growers.
<P>
<B>Cover Crops</B>
<P>
Cover crops can be beneficial for
intensive organic vegetable production in a number of ways.  Water
penetration and infil-tration can be improved by root growth of
a cover crop and by returning organic matter to soils.  Increased
organic matter may improve the soil's ability to retain moisture.
 If leguminous cover crops are grown, soil nitrogen can be increased
through nitrogen fixation.  Grasses are particularly helpful in
promoting soil structure and soil aggregate stability because
of their fibrous root systems.  Microbial activity, often sti-mulated
by cover crop root exudates and organic matter additions to soils,
has also been shown to promote aggregate stability.  As microbes
decompose organic matter, nutrients are released.  Weed suppression
for subsequent crops may be another benefit.  Furthermore, cover
crops can provide a favorable envi-ronment to attract and sustain
beneficial arthropods.
<P>
 Planting cover crops in intensive
organic vegetable operations may result in some negative impacts.
 Cover crops may attract some arthropod pests to production areas.
 Fall planted cover crops prevent ground from being worked up
to allow for spring planting flexibility.  Cover crops also require
additional inputs such as seed, irrigation water, and labor. 
In addition, revenue-producing vegetable crop acreage is reduced
when a cover crop is grown.  However, some growers view the cost
of planting and maintaining a cover crop as the cost of producing
nitrogen and/or improving soil quality for the long-term.
<P>
 Selection of a particular cover
crop species should take into account the growing needs of the
cover crop itself as well as the previous and subsequent vegetable
crops, the soil type, and any irrigation requirements.  In this
region commonly planted cover crops include, but are not limited
to, legumes such as vetch and bell beans and certain annual grasses
such as barley, rye, and oats.  Growers may use a grass/legume
mixture to obtain benefits that are unique to each cover crop
type.  Cover crops may be planted on a year-round basis depending
upon how they fit into a grower's rotation scheme.  Vegetable
crops that follow a cover crop may not require a compost or manure
application to supply nutrients for crop production.  Growers
in some areas may find that certain cover crop species and mixes
are not suitable for their soils and conditions.  Often, the most
suitable cover crop in each situation is determined by observation
and experimentation over a period of years.
<P>
<B>Pest Management</B>
<P>
Most pesticides that are currently
used by producers of conventionally grown vegetables are not approved
for use by organic vegetable growers.  However, grower experience
indicates that fewer disease and insect problems exist overall
in organic systems.  Organic growers may also be willing to tolerate
more pest pressure in the field than conventional growers.  Nevertheless,
when necessary, some treatments such as natural pesticides and
biological controls are used to decrease pest damage and reduce
short-run economic risks.  These treatments, in conjunction with
crop diversification, rotation and cultural practices usually
reduce and/or control disease, weed, and insect problems.  When
pest management materials are used, application rates will vary
depending on the specific crop and the extensiveness of a pest
infestation.  Growers should be certain that any materials used
are in compliance with the rules and regulations of state and
organic certification agencies.  For additional information refer
to the Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities section.
<P>
 <B>Diseases.  </B>Important diseases
that have occurred in organic vegetable production areas of the
Central Coast include:  <I>Pythium</I>, <I>Rhizoctonia </I>and<I>
Fusarium</I> on onions and squash, viruses such as beet yellows
on lettuce and cabbage, and fungal diseases such as downy mildew
(<I>Peronospora destructor) </I>on onions and powdery mildew (<I>Leveillula
taurica) </I>on peppers.  Techniques to minimize the incidence
of disease in organic vegetable crops include:
<P>
1. Planting high quality disease-resistant
cultivars.
<P>
2. Avoid planting at certain times
of the year because of severe disease incidence.
<P>
3. Improving field drainage and/or
modifying irrigation methods.  Moist and wet fields provide a
favorable environment for disease.  Sprinkler irrigation should
be avoided on some crops such as onions and garlic.
<P>
4. Mechanical and hand cultivations
to remove weeds that may harbor disease.
<P>
5. The control of disease-transmitting
insects (aphids and beetles) by such means as insecticidal soap
sprays and diversified plantings for biological control.
<P>
6. Sanitation of equipment when moving
from field to field.
<P>
7. Crop rotations.
<P>
 <B>Weeds.  </B>Optimal weed control
in organic vegetable systems in the Central Coast often results
from the integration of a number of weed control techniques. 
Weeds are largely managed by tillage with a sled or rolling cultivator.
 Each cultivation's timing is dependent on the season the vegetable
crop is planted, the amount of soil moisture, the crop's stage
of growth, and the crop's ability to compete effectively with
weeds.  Hand weeding is often used in addition to mechanical cultivations.
<P>
 Flame weeders are also being utilized
by growers to reduce weed populations.  Weeds are not actually
burned back by flaming; they are killed by desiccation when the
plant's cells burst upon exposure to the high temperatures that
a flame weeder produces.  Flame weeding is most effective when
used on broadleaf seedling weeds and is generally not useful in
eliminating volunteer grasses with protected growing points. 
Since no soil disruption occurs with flame weeding, additional
weed seeds are not brought to the soil surface for germination.
<P>
 Plastic or organic mulches may also
be used by some growers to block light and prevent weed seed germination.
 Vegetable crops are customarily planted directly through mulches
to keep weed populations low throughout the growing season.  Water
usage may decrease when mulches are used because moisture retention
generally increases.  The use of some mulching materials may be
restricted by registration and/or certification agencies.
<P>
 <B>Insects.  </B>Insect pests that
are prevalent in organic production systems in the Central Coast
include a number of different aphid species, flea beetles (<I>Epitrix
</I>and <I>Phyllotreta</I> spp), the spotted cucumber beetle (<I>Diabrotica
undecim-punctata undecimpunctata)</I>, corn ear-worm <I>(Heliothis
zea)</I>, the cabbage looper (<I>Trichoplusia ni)</I>, and the
imported cabbage worm (<I>Pieris rapae).  </I>These insects attack
a variety of vegetable crops, feeding on plant foliage, stems,
flowers, and fruits.  Economic damage is therefore caused by reduced
plant growth, weakened and scarred plants and fruit, and ultimately,
decreased yields.
<P>
 Methods used to reduce or manage
caterpillar populations include spray applications of the bacteria
<I>Bacillus thuringiensis </I>and the botanical insecticide Pyrellin
E.C.&#174;  Applications of insecticidal soap and Pyrellin E.C.&#174;
are sometimes used for aphid control.  In addition, Pyrellin E.C.&#174;
may be helpful in controlling some beetle pests.  Insecticidal
soaps are derived from plant oils or animal fats and are currently
allowed for use by organic growers.  Pyrellin E.C.&#174; is a
formulated insecticide that is derived from a combination of two
plant extracts, pyrethrum and rotenone.  Pyrethrin is currently
an acceptable method of insect control in California organic farming
<I>provided it does not contain the synergist piperonyl butoxide</I>.
 However, the use of some botanical insecticides has been associated
with a decrease in beneficial arthropod populations so is generally
applied only when pest pressure is severe.
<P>
 Pheromone traps may be used by some
growers to monitor pest populations.  Pest management may also
include the release of biological control agents to augment that
which may already exist in the field.  For example, release of
beneficial wasps of the genus <I>Trichogramma </I>may help control
corn earworm.  Additionally, some growers maintain insectary plantings
in or near fields to provide a habitat and food source for beneficial
arthropods.
<P>
<B>Marketing</B>
<P>
The marketing of organically produced
vegetables presents Central Coast growers with a number of challenges.
  Total supply, consumer demand, pricing, perishability of the
product, and market structure are all factors that contribute
to a grower's ability to sell his/her product.  Therefore, production
and market risks both affect the profitability and economic viability
of organically grown vegetables.  In all cases, the risks associated
with organic vegetable operations should not be minimized.
<P>
 Organic vegetables, like many fresh
market commodities, are a highly peri-shable product.  Growers
must harvest, pack, and sell their products in an expedient manner
to receive satisfactory returns.  Therefore, from a marketing
perspective vegetables carry a greater risk than such storable
commodities as nuts and grains.  Some organic vegetable growers
may reduce this risk by planting crops such as winter squash,
onions, garlic, and potatoes which may be stored for longer periods
of time.
<P>
 Commodities that are produced orga-nically
can often be sold for a premium price over conventionally grown
products.  However, the industry is extremely competitive and
returns to growers are dictated by the total supply, consumer
demand, and the available organic outlets.  Market saturation
often occurs.  Growers may then be forced to accept lower returns
and/or market their product without the organic designation at
conventional prices.
<P>
 Although research indicates that
organic vegetable production has expanded considerably in the
1980's and 1990's, there is some debate as to whether consumer
demand and market outlets geared toward organic produce have expanded
at the same rate.  A product's price and appearance, consistency
of the supply, and market location and accessibility may influence
a consumer's willingness to purchase organic commo-dities.  Organic
agriculture's perceived benefits, including food and farm worker
safety, improved nutritive values, and positive environmental
effects may also influence a consumer's decision to purchase organic
products.  Within the State of California, the Central Coast enjoys
somewhat of a marketing edge.  Its juxtaposition to the San Francisco
Bay Area, with its coordinated market channels and its large contingent
of environmentally conscious consumers allows growers some ease
and flexibility in selling their products.  Market channels within
the Bay Area include produce brokers, wholesalers, retailers,
and direct markets.  All are integral in facilitating the handling
and distribution of organic vegetables grown in the Central Coast.
 Los Angeles also supports a large organic market and is relatively
close in proximity to the Central Coast.  It may therefore provide
an additional market-ing avenue for organic vegetable growers
in the region.
<P>
<B>Regulation of Organic Commodities</B>
<P>
As of January 1, 1992 all growers
who choose  to   produce   and  market  organic commodities  must
  register   on  a  yearly basis with the State of California
under the California Organic Foods Act of 1990.  Enforced under
this act are the provisions of Article 4.5 (commencing with Section
26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21 of the California Health
and Safety Code and of the California Food and Agricultural Code
commencing with Section 46000.  These provisions contain rules
and regulations that must be adhered to by all producers, processors
and handlers of organic commodities.  The act states that prior
to January 1, 1995, producers of organic commodities may not apply
prohibited materials or substances to annual or two-year crops
for a minimum of twelve months prior to seed planting or twelve
months prior to the appearance of flower buds for perennial crops
to qualify as organic.  From January 1, 1995 through December
31, 1995, this rule increases to a twenty-four month period of
prohibition.  On or after January 1, 1996 the restriction increases
to thirty-six months.  
<P>
 State registration fees are estimated
by the registrant's total gross sales from the previous year.
 If no sales occurred in the previous year, fee remittance is
based on the projected gross receipts.  First year registrants
must pay a one-time only assessment equal to one and one-half
times the yearly state registration fee.
<P>
 The federal Organic Foods Production
Act of 1990 (OFPA) became effective on October 1, 1993.  However,
due to budget and time constraints, final recommen-dations for
the law's implementation has not been completed.  Therefore, even
though the law is now in place, imple-mentation and enforcement
will be delayed for at least one year.  Nonetheless, growers would
be wise to follow federal regulations and production standards
(in addition to state regulations) at this time.  The OFPA is
administered through the United States Department of Agriculture.
<P>
 The OFPA preempts California's state
law except in those cases where the state applies  to   the  
USDA   for   approval   of 
<P>
stricter standards.  Two differences
between the state and federal laws are noteworthy.  First, the
federal law stipu-lates that organic foods must not be produced
on land to which a prohibited substance has been applied for a
minimum of three years immediately preceding harvest of the crop
to qualify as organic.  Second, federal law states that growers
must be certified by a federally accredited certifying agent on
an annual basis if yearly gross sales total more than $5,000.
 This federal requirement should not be confused with, and is
separate from, state registration.
<P>
 In 1992 only one-third of the registered
organic farmers in California were certified by a certification
agency.  Appro-ximately ninety percent of those certified were
certified through California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).
 In addition to CCOF, five other organizations actively certify
growers in the state.  They are: Farm Verified Organic (FVO),
the Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA), the Organic Growers
and Buyers Association (OGBA), Quality Assurance International
(QAI) and Scientific Certification Systems (SCS).  Each agency
should adhere to all state and federal laws regulating organic
commodities, and in addition may enforce standards and procedures
specific to their own agencies.  The above organizations are registered
with the State of California.  However, none are currently accredited
by the USDA since the USDA's certification program has not yet
been implemented.

This study reflects the practices
and costs associated with an intensive production system for various
organic vegetable crops and two cover crops currently grown in
the Central Coast region.  They are: barley (cover crop), cabbage
(green), cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic, lettuce (leaf and romaine),
onions (red and yellow), peas (non-staked snap and snow), peppers
(green and red bell), sweet corn, vetch (cover crop), and winter

<P>
 The farm in this report is assumed
to be registered and certified as organic.  To be registered and
certified organic, a transition period is required for any farm
changing from conventional practices to organically acceptable
methods.  State registration and certification agency rules and
regulations that are specific to organic commodities must be adhered
to during this time period.  Crops grown in transition years may
not be sold or labeled as organic.  Commodities that are pro-duced
organically can often be sold for a premium price over conventionally
grown products.  However, the supply of organic products, market
competition, and consumer demand can affect grower returns.
<P>
 The following is a description of
general assumptions pertaining to sample production costs for
the diversified organic vegetable operation analyzed in this study.
 The costs are based on common practices used by Central Coast
growers and may not be applicable to all situations.  Production
practices and management techniques are generally individualized
to meet the specific needs of each grower.  These costs are represented
on an annual per acre basis.
<P>
<B> Land.  </B>The
total farm size is 115 acres.  In this study, land is rented by
the grower at an annual cost of $500 per acre.  This figure can
be highly variable and depends on the parcel location.  Additional
factors affecting the cost to rent organic vegetable production
land may include soil type and water availability.  Land is assumed
to be level, with well drained soils of moderate depth and fertility.
<P>
 Two crops are harvested off of 45
of the 115 acres of land each year for a total of 160 production
units.  Therefore, all cash and non-cash overhead costs are spread
evenly over 160 producing acres rather than the physical 115 acre
land base.
<P>
<B> Production Practices.  </B>Production
practices for each crop in this study are listed in table type
a. Costs To Produce.  These tables show the order in which the
operations are performed, as well as the hours per acre to perform
each operation.  Labor and custom rates, material and fuel and
repair costs are also included in these tables.  Input costs can
be found in table type b. Operating Input Costs. <I><B> </B></I>In
addition, the sequence of operations and the monthly cash costs
for each crop can be found in table type c. Monthly Cash Costs
Per Acre.
<P>
 In this report no crop varieties
are specified.  Crops are assumed to be planted on 40-inch beds.
 Seed and transplant costs are within a range of costs for different
open-pollinated and hybrid vegetable cultivars.  Varietal planting
decisions should ultimately be based on the crop's compatibility
to the climatic region, the disease-resistance capability, yield
potential, overall quality at harvest, and the cultivar's marketability.
<P>
 To manage soil tilth, fertility,
and nutrient levels, some soil amendments are applied to production
lands.  Material and application rate options are shown in the
following table.  Soil amendments are generally added if warranted
by appropriate sampling.  Refer to table type b. Operating Inut
Costs for the specific material and application rates used in
this study.
<P>
 <B>Crop Irrigation Requirements.
 </B>Each crop has different irrigation requirements depending
on the rooting depth and the crop itself, the soil type, andthe
growing season.  In this study crops are irrigated by sprinkler
or furrow (gated pipe) irrigation.  Water is pumped from underground
wells.  Because the  land is rented, the land owner is assumed
to be responsible for well and under-ground irrigation system
maintenance and repair.  Costs for irrigation pipe are located
in Table 19 under investments.

<P>
 <B>Cover Crops.  </B>In this report,
two winter annual cover crops are sown each year in the fall on
a total of 40 acres of the vegetable production land.  The planted
cover crops are assumed to be 'Lana' woolypod vetch and barley.
 Twenty acres of each species is assumed to be planted.
<P>
 To prepare the ground for seeding
of the cover crop, land is disced once in the fall after the vegetable
harvest.  Following this practice, land is chiseled one time and
disced two additional times.  Seed is then drilled at a rate of
75 pounds per acre for barley or 40 pounds per acre for vetch.
 The cover crop is sprinkler irrigated with approximately three
inches of water for germination.  After this irrigation, cover
crop growth is dependent on moisture in the soil profile and fall
and winter rains.  In late March, the cover crop is mowed once
and incorporated into the soil by discing.  The timing of these
operations is dependent on the planting schedule for the following
vegetable crop.  Costs for the cover crop incorporation (discing)
are included as land preparation costs for the subsequent vegetable
crop.
<P>
 The cost to produce each cover crop
on a per acre basis is calculated in<B> </B>table types a., b.
and c. in<B> </B>Tables 16-17.  The total cost to produce 40 acres
of cover crops ($3,256) is calculated by multiplying the cost
per acre for each of the two cover crops by 20 acres and then
summing the two totals.  In this study, the cover crop is considered
an investment for the farm and is shown in<I><B> </B></I>Table
19 under investments.  This investment is spread over the 160
revenue-generating acres to better reflect the actual cost of
producing organic vegetables.  The amount is also shown on an
annual per acre basis for each crop in table type a<I><B> </B></I>and
table type b under non-cash overhead costs.
<P>
 <B>Pest Management.  </B>In this
study, disease incidence and invertebrate and vertebrate pest
damage are assumed to be low.  However, these may vary on a year
to year basis depending on pest popu-lations and management techniques.
 Weed populations are reduced through a variety of techniques
including mechanical cultivations, hand and flame weedings.  Refer
to table type a<I><B> </B></I>and<I><B> </B></I>table type b<I><B>
</B></I>following this section for pest control measures pertinent
to this study.  Individual situations may vary.
<P>
 <B>Harvest.  </B>In this report,
most harvest operations are performed by the grower without custom
or contract labor.  Exceptions are windrowing garlic and topping
onions, which are performed by contract labor.  Onions are sorted,
sized and graded by farm workers on a specialized machine.  All
other operations reflect hand harvest and field or shed packing.
 Labor hours for harvest, sorting, grading, and packing will vary
on a year to year basis depending on crop and field conditions.
 Many crops included in this study can be planted and harvested
at varying times throughout the year.  Refer to table type a<I><B>
</B></I>and<I><B> </B></I>table type c for the labor costs and
individual harvest dates pertinent to this study.
<P>
 For information on custom or contract
harvesting, contact the farm advisor or companies contracting
for vegetables in the area of interest.  If contract or custom
labor is used, equipment for the required operations should be
deleted from the equipment list.  Labor, fuel, repairs, depreciation
and interest on investment should be also be subtracted as a cost
of production.  Custom charges, then, would be added to harvest
costs.
<P>
 <B>Yield &amp; Return.  </B>Table
type a<I><B> </B></I>shows a reasonable yield for each crop contained
in this study factoring in crop damage and loss over a period
of years.  For example, lettuce yields may vary greatly on a season
to season basis.  Under good conditions, yields of 850 boxes (24
count) are possible for some varieties.  However, when pest and
disease infestations are high, economics may dictate that the
crop be disced under rather than harvested.  Intermediate yield
levels of 575 boxes for leaf lettuce and 525 boxes for romaine
lettuce were used to calculate cost per box (Table 5a and 6a).
<P>
 Yield and return ranges for each
vegetable crop are included in Table 18.  Yield and Return Ranges
for Selected Central Coast Organic Vegetable Crops.  These figures
represent the high and low yields and returns that are possible
in a production year given such factors as pest damage and market
competitiveness.  The return figures reflect the amount received
by growers after cooling and/or marketing fees have been subtracted
(refer to the marketing section below).
<P>
 <B>Marketing.  </B>In the Central
Coast, there are a number of marketing options for growers of
organically produced vegetables.  Depending on farm size, amount
produced and marketing plan, growers may choose to sell their
products through organic produce brokers, wholesalers, or direct
markets in surrounding areas.
<P>
 This study assumes that growers
market their products through local organic produce brokers. 
Growers pack, label, and transport their products to brokers (generally
directly after harvest).  Produce brokers then act as the intermediary
between producers and buyers; that is, they facilitate cooling
(where applicable), handling, sales, and distribution of the product
for a fee or commission.  Marketing through a produce broker does
not necessarily guarantee that a product is or will be automatically
sold.  In some cases growers may have their products returned.
 However, this marketing method is often preferred by growers
with greater expertise and interest in production rather than
marketing.
<P>
 <B>Labor.  </B>Basic hourly wages
for workers are $6.50 and $6.15 per hour for machine operators
and field workers, respectively.  Adding 34% for SDI, FICA, insurance
and other benefits increases the labor rates shown to $8.71 per
hour for machine labor and $8.24 per hour for non-machine labor.
 The labor hours for operations involving machinery are 20% higher
than the operations to account for extra labor involved in equipment
setup, moving, maintenance and repair.  Wages for managers are
not included as a cash cost.  Any returns above total costs are
considered returns to management and risk.
<P>
 <B>Investment.  </B>The investments
shown in Table 19.  Whole Farm Annual Equipment, Investment, and
Business Over-head Costs for a Diversified Organic Vegetable Operation,
are those that are allocated to the entire vegetable farm.  Annual
investments shown in table type a<I><B> </B></I>and<I><B> </B></I>table
type b<I><B> </B></I>represent depreciation and opportunity cost
for each investment on an annual per acre basis.
<P>
 <B>Business Overhead.  </B>County
taxes are calculated as 1% of the average value of equipment and
any buildings or improvements.  Investment insurance is charged
at 0.5% of the average value of all assets over their useful life.
 Liability insurance covers accidents on the farm and costs $300
per year.  Sanitation services are estimated at $82.50 per month
on a year-round basis.  Office and business costs are estimated
at $85 per acre for the farm.  These expenses include office supplies,
telephones, bookkeeping, accounting, legal fees, business trips,
subscription fees, and road preparation and maintenance.
<P>
 <B>Assessments.  </B>In this study,
a stepped scale organic grower's registration fee of $1,000 is
assessed by the State of California on the gross sales amount
of $1,086,944.  The gross sales amount is calculated by multiplying
the yield of each crop by the price received for each crop and
the number of planted acres for each crop.  This is only an estimate
of potential fees and will vary depending on yields and returns.
 Contact the County Agricultural Commissioner in your area for
further details.
<P>
 The grower is assumed to be certified
by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).  Annual membership
fees are $125.  Inspection fees are $125.  Assessment fees are
.5% of a grower's gross sales and are included as a cost of production.
 Total CCOF assessments for the farm are $5,434.  These fees are
specific to this study.  Fees are based on the production amount,
the number of acres and parcels contained in an operation as well
as whether or not the farm is totally organic.  Therefore, individual
situations may vary.
<P>
 <B>Interest.  </B>Interest on operating
capital is based on cash costs and is calculated monthly until
harvest at a nominal interest rate of 9% per year.  Interest is
also charged on investment at a real interest rate of 4% per year
to  account for income foregone that could be received from an
alternative investment (opportu-nity cost) and is based on the
average value of equipment and any buildings.  The real interest
rate indicates the return for the use of capital and does not
include any  adjustment  for  inflation.   Nominal interest rates contain a factor for
inflation.
<P>
 <B>Equipment Costs.  </B>In allocating
the equipment costs per acre, the following calculations were
made and shown in Table 19.  Whole Farm Annual Equipment, Investment,
and Business Over-head Costs for a Diversified Organic Vegetable
Operation:  (a) Original Cost of equipment is the cost of the
new equip-ment plus sales tax.  (b) Depreciation is straight line
with a 10% salvage value.  (c) Interest on investment is calculated
as the average value per acre of the equipment during its useful
life multiplied by a real interest rate of 4%.  Average value
per acre equals new cost plus salvage value divided by two divided
by the number of acres. (d)  The Total Investment Costs are calculated
as 35% of the depreciation and the interest costs for all new
equipment to reflect a mix of the new and used equipment.  These
values are also used in table type a.  All of this equipment is
used on the 115 acre vegetable operation.
<P>
 <B>Fuel and Repair.  </B>The fuel
and repair cost per acre for each operation in table type a<I><B>
</B></I>is determined by multiplying the total hourly operating
cost for each piece of equipment in Table 20 by the number of
hours per acre for that operation.  Prices for on-farm delivery
of gasoline and diesel are $0.98 and $0.71 per gallon, respectively.

</CENTER>

<P>
<U><B>Introduction</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> California is the largest producer of processing
tomatoes in the world, with over one-third of the state's crop
produced in the Sacramento Valley.  In recent years California's
organic agricultural industry has expanded considerably.  Coinciding
with the expansion of organic agriculture, several Sacramento
Valley growers now dedicate a portion of their acreage to the
production of organic processing tomatoes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Sacramento Valley farms producing processing
tomatoes for the organic market are typically large, with a farm
size ranging from 600 to 4,500 acres.  However, only a small portion
of the acreage (150 to 500 acres) is committed to organic production.
 Crops are rotated on these farms so the number of acres planted
each year to tomatoes is smaller yet, and usually ranges from
50 to 150 acres.  Crops rotated with tomatoes include alfalfa,
corn, legumes (vetch, chick peas, cowpeas, dry beans and clover),
melons, rice, safflower, squash, sugar beets, sunflower and/or
wheat.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Like conventional farming, there are a
number of different approaches to growing organic tomatoes.  This
overview is meant to guide the reader through the critical topics
and issues that are related to producing organic processing tomatoes.
 The first section discusses contracts for processing tomatoes
and grower risk.  The second section describes the general sequence
of operations for the production of organic processing tomatoes.
 Following this description, three additional sections provide
more detail about crop rotation and diversification, cover crops,
and pest management.  In the final section, we address the current
status of regulations governing organic commodities.</FONT>
<P>
<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Processing Tomato Contracts and Grower
Risk</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Growers do not plant tomatoes for processing
without a contract.  Contracts between growers and processors
are negotiated in the fall or winter before the crop is planted.
 This contract specifies the amount of tonnage that is expected
to be delivered to the cannery during a particular period and
the return price on a per ton basis.  Contracts with processors
for organic tomatoes usually provide a pricing premium of $20
to $40 per ton over the conventional market price.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> To insure that sufficient tonnage is produced
to meet the contractual agreement, growers sometimes plant a greater
number of acres to tomatoes in case the yield per acre is lower
than expected.  Occasionally, additional acreage is planted in
anticipation of increased demand by a cannery.  Both of these
practices increase grower risk over and above the usual production
risks since there is no guarantee that any additional tonnage
will be purchased by a cannery.  For organic growers, overproduction
may result in returns that are the same as for conventionally
produced tomatoes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Organically produced canning tomatoes currently
represent only a small segment of the processing industry and
contracts are limited.  Few California canners currently handle
organically grown processing tomatoes.  They are: Escalon Packers
located in Escalon, Gilroy Foods located in Gilroy and Sun Garden
Packing Company located in San Jose.  Organically produced canning
tomatoes are labelled and marketed as whole peel, diced, ground,
paste or sauce under a variety of different brand names, including
Muir Glen of Sacramento and Millina's Finest of Aptos, California.
 Additionally, Timber Crest Farms located in Healdsburg contracts
with growers for tomatoes for drying.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> To reduce overall production risks for
organic processing tomatoes, many growers purchase crop insurance.
 Insurance is purchased on a per acre basis and covers crop losses
caused by specific natural hazards.  Approximately one-third of
the total California processing tomato crop is insured.</FONT>
<P>
<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Production Practices</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Many of the production practices for organically
grown processing tomatoes are similar to that of a conventionally
grown crop.  Cultural operations begin in the fall with land preparation
and ground work often takes place before contracts are signed
in anticipation of securing a tomato contract.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>Land Preparation.  </B>Ground work typically
begins by discing the soil twice.  After this initial discing,
land is chiseled once or twice, followed by one or two additional
discings.  Fields are then land-planed twice.  The number of passes
for each operation is dependent on the amount of residue to be
turned under from the previous crop as well as the tilth of the
soil.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Fertilizing materials such as manure, composted
manure, mined gypsum and/or rock phosphate are often spread by
a custom operator or by the grower during land preparation.  Manure
and composted manure provide organic matter as well as nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium at varying levels depending on the material's
composition.  Gypsum adds calcium and sulfur for crop production
and can be used to improve soil tilth with soils high in sodium.
 Rock phosphate adds phosphorus and calcium to soils.  It is not
necessary to apply some fertilizing materials every year to successfully
produce a tomato crop.  Materials are generally applied if soil
sample analyses indicate a need.  In addition, grower experience,
cropping sequence and cost will help determine the appropriate
fertility program.  Other soil fertility management techniques
include crop rotation and cover cropping.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> When fertilizers are used, growers usually
disc shallowly after the application to incorporate materials
into the soil's top layer.  Beds are then listed and shaped. 
These operations are generally performed in October, but may be
slightly delayed depending on the previous crop's harvest period.
 No further operations are usually performed until December, January
or February when beds are mechanically cultivated to remove weed
growth prompted by fall and winter rains.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>Direct seeding.  </B>Tomatoes are direct
seeded on single or double row 60-inch beds (furrow to furrow).
 Direct seeded crops are planted as early as January and as late
as March.  A liquid starter fertilizer of fish powder and kelp
extract is sometimes applied at the time of seeding.  Alternatively,
some growers sprinkler irrigate directly after seeding and apply
a &quot;top dressing&quot; of manure or compost after planting.
 Pre and post emergence flame weeding is sometimes utilized by
growers.  Hand thinning and weeding is required approximately
three to five weeks after the initial planting depending on soil
temperatures and germination rates.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times"> Transplanting.  </FONT></B><FONT FACE="CG Times">In
the Sacramento Valley, transplanted tomatoes are generally planted
on single row 60-inch beds.  Transplanting takes place in March
for a July harvest or in April for an August harvest.  Although
establishment costs are greater for transplanting than for direct
seeding, there are potential benefits:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">1. Transplanting extends the period of time
for winter cover crop growth.  Many growers would like to precede
a tomato crop with a cover crop to increase organic matter and
nitrogen levels.  However, green manure crops are typically planted
in the fall, grown over the winter and incorporated into soils
in the spring after the majority of vegetative growth has occurred.
 The optimum time for incorporation is well past the optimal planting
dates for organically grown direct seeded tomatoes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">2. Tomatoes transplanted in early March
can be harvested in July thus avoiding periods of peak fruit damaging
insect activity.  This practice may not be practical when used
in conjunction with a green manure crop because the cover crop
might not have attained maximum vegetative growth by the early
March tomato transplant date.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">3. Transplants often compete better with
weeds initially and may therefore reduce the total number of cultivations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">4. By reducing irrigations for field stand
establishment, transplants may reduce the total number of field
irrigations and overall water use.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">Under organic regulations, transplants must
be grown in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of
1990 and the federal Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 in addition
to specific organic certification rules and regulations (where
applicable).  Refer to the <B>Regulations of Organically Grown
Commodities </B>section for additional information.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>Cultivars and General Management.</B>
 Hybrid varieties are predominantly used.  Cultivar selection
is based on yield potential with considerations for disease resistance,
plant characteristics and field performance.  Processors usually
request specific cultivars based on canning characteristics. 
Currently, three varieties are commonly planted in this area:
 Ferry Morse 882, Orsetti's Halley 3155 and Asgrow Brigade 5210.
 All three varieties are bred for resistance to the fungal pathogens
Fusarium wilt (<I>Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici</I> races
1 and 2) and Verticillium wilt (<I>Verticillium dahliae</I> strain
1).  Ferry Morse 882 is also bred for resistance to bacterial
speck (<I>Pseudomonas syringae </I>pv.<I> tomato</I>) and root-knot
nematode (<I>Meloidogyne </I>spp).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Other pest management techniques for the
control of diseases, insects, mites and weeds begin as early as
the month of March and extend through July depending on the farm
location, the previous year's pest incidence and climatic conditions.
 Refer to the <B>Pest Management </B>section for further information.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Growers in this area often apply foliar
nutrient sprays one to two times in the spring and summer months
to enhance plant growth and health.  Some nutrient materials are
added to irrigation water rather than applied as foliar sprays.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Crop irrigations are usually performed
from March through July.  The delivery method, number of applications,
and the amount of applied surface water varies from location to
location.  Total applied water depends on the soil type, residual
soil moisture, whether the crop is direct seeded or transplanted,
and water availability.  A number of growers use sprinkler irrigation
for crop germination and early seedling growth and then switch
to furrow irrigation.  Alternatively, some growers use furrow
irrigation during the entire growing season.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> For some tomato cultivars, it is necessary
to train vines prior to harvest.  Like conventionally grown processing
tomatoes, organically grown tomatoes are mechanically harvested.
 Fruit maturity at harvest is largely determined by the planting
date and weather conditions.  At harvest, tomato fruit is transported
to a cannery for processing.  Processors require organically produced
fruit to meet the same industry standards for quality as those
of conventionally grown tomatoes.  Yields for organically produced
tomatoes in the Sacramento Valley range from 20-38 tons per acre.
 Yields are influenced by many factors including varietal selection,
production location, weather conditions, soil fertility and grower
management.</FONT>
<P>
<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Crop Rotation and Diversification</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Crop rotation and diversification are important
elements of organic row and field crop operations.  Diversification
can enhance economic stability by allowing production risks to
be spread over a greater number of crops.  Ideally, the crop mix
should be complementary; that is, all practices should be performed
in a timely manner without competition for labor, equipment, and
management expertise.  In reality, this may not always be possible
because of factors beyond a grower's control, such as unusual
weather conditions, pest infestations, or peak work periods. 
Diversification may also mean that a grower will need additional
resources such as specialized farm machinery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Rotations are characterized by cropping
sequences that alternate a variety of crops and often include
a cover or green manure crop.  Because of the importance of soil
fertility and soil organic matter, organic farmers are increasingly
planting some acreage to cover crops (refer to the <B>Cover Crops
</B>section).  A crop rotation's purpose is to recycle nutrients,
break pest cycles, and/or maintain a balance between soil organic
matter accumulation and decomposition.  Organic matter is particularly
important for improving soil structure and for providing nitrogen
and other nutrients for crop production.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>Figure 1. <I>Sample Rotations for Organic
Processing Tomatoes </I></B>includes information on three different
rotation schemes for processing tomatoes.  Individual organic
farmers have differing strategies for planting and rotating a
variety of crops.  Cropping history and grower experience will
factor into the determination of each year's rotation.  Other
considerations include:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">1. The requirements of each crop's culture.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">2. The compatibility of each crop in terms
of labor, equipment and seasonal timing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">3. The ability to provide year-round employment
for farm workers.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">4. The availability of nutrients.  Crops
with greater nutrient requirements may produce higher yields when
following a cover crop.  Also, crops with different root growth
patterns may be better able to utilize residual nutrients that
a previous crop was unable to capture.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">5. The existing pest complex including weeds,
disease, and arthropods (insects, spiders and mites).  Selection
of a crop that competes well with weeds, or planting disease-resistant
cultivars may help overcome some of these difficulties.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">6. The crop value and access to markets.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Organic processing tomato growers usually
plant tomatoes once every two to four years on a given field.
 Since a typical farm consists of multiple fields, tomatoes will
be grown somewhere on the farm each season.  Other crops used
with tomatoes in rotation include alfalfa, corn, legumes (vetch,
chick peas, cowpeas, dry beans and clover), melons, rice, safflower,
squash, sugar beets, sunflower and wheat.</FONT>

<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Cover Crops</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Cover crops can be beneficial for crop
production in a number of ways.  Water penetration and infiltration
can be improved by root growth of a cover crop and by returning
organic matter to soils.  Grasses are particularly helpful in
promoting soil structure and soil aggregate stability because
of their fibrous root systems.  Microbial activity, often stimulated
by cover crop root exudates and organic matter additions to soils,
has also been shown to promote aggregate stability.  Nutrients
are released as microbes decompose organic matter.  If leguminous
cover crops are grown, soil nitrogen can be increased through
nitrogen fixation.  Weed suppression for subsequent crops may
be another benefit.  Furthermore, cover crops increase plant diversity
in a farming system and in the flowering stage can provide nectar
to attract and sustain beneficial arthropods.  Although most cover
crops are incorporated before flowering, some growers plant cover
crops on field borders or perimeters as habitat for beneficials.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Planting cover crops may result in some
negative impacts.  Cover crops may attract some arthropod pests
to production areas.  Fall planted cover crops prevent ground
from being worked up in the fall for early spring planting which
is typical in conventional systems.  Cover crops also require
additional inputs such as seed, irrigation water, and labor. 
However, many growers view the cost of planting and maintaining
a cover crop as the cost of producing nitrogen and/or improving
soil quality for the long-term.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Selection of a particular cover crop species
should take into account the growing requirements of the cover
crop itself as well as the previous and subsequent crops, the
soil type, and possible irrigation for stand establishment in
dry years.  In this region legumes such as vetch and cowpeas are
commonly planted as cover crops.  Revenue-producing crops that
follow a cover crop do not generally require a compost or manure
application to supply nutrients for crop production.  Growers
in some areas may find that certain cover crop species are not
suitable for the soils and conditions on their farm.  Often, the
most appropriate cover crop in each situation is determined by
observation and experimentation over a period of years.</FONT>
<P>
<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Pest Management</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Many pesticides that are currently used
by producers of conventionally grown processing tomatoes are not
approved for use by growers of organic tomatoes.  In general,
pest control products used by organic growers are not as effective
as synthetic pesticides for immediate or acute problems.  Therefore,
pest identification, monitoring and prevention are essential elements
of successful organic processing tomato production.  However,
when necessary some treatments such as natural pesticides and
biological controls are used to decrease pest damage and reduce
short-run economic risks.  These treatments, in conjunction with
crop rotation, diversification and cultural practices may reduce
and/or control disease, weed and insect problems.  When pest management
materials are used, application rates will vary depending the
extensiveness of a pest infestation.  Growers should be certain
that any materials used are in compliance with the rules and regulations
of federal, state and organic certification agencies (refer to
the <B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B> section).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times"> Diseases.  </FONT></B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Important
diseases that have occurred in organic tomato production areas
of the Sacramento Valley include:  phytophthora root rot (<I>Phytophthora
</I>spp.), vascular wilts caused by the fungi <I>Fusarium </I>and<I>
Verticillium</I>, powdery mildew<I> </I>(<I>Leveillula taurica</I>)<I>
</I>and bacterial speck.<I>  </I>Techniques used to minimize the
incidence of disease for organic processing tomatoes include:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">1. Plant cultivars resistant to multiple
diseases.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">2. Improve field drainage and/or modify
irrigation methods.  Saturated soils provide a favorable environment
for <I>Phytophthora </I>and <I>Pythium </I>root rots.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">3. Remove weeds that may harbor disease
by cultivating mechanically or by hand.</FONT>

<FONT FACE="CG Times">4. Control disease-transmitting insects
such as aphids with insecticidal soap sprays and diversified plantings

<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">6. Use crop rotations.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> When necessary, organic tomato growers
in the Sacramento Valley apply sulfur dust once or twice aerially
to control powdery mildew.  If conditions are ideal for bacterial
speck (cool, wet springs), growers apply copper fungicides to
control the disease.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times"> Insects and mites.  </FONT></B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Insect
pests found in organic production systems in the Sacramento Valley
include the tomato russet mite (<I>Aculops lycopersici</I>), cucumber
beetles (<I>Diabrotica undecimpunctata undecimpunctata</I>) and
flea beetles (<I>Epitrix </I>and<I> Phyllotreta</I> spp.).  Periodically
various stink bugs and caterpillars also infest processing tomato
fields.  These insects feed on plant foliage, stems, flowers and
fruit.  Economic damage occurs when pest populations are significant
enough to weaken and reduce plant growth, scar and damage fruit,
and decrease overall yields.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> The same sulfur dust application that is
used to control the disease powdery mildew (refer to the disease
section above) also controls tomato russet mites.  When necessary,
growers use the mineral insecticide Cryolite for controlling various
beetle and caterpillar species.  The bacterium <I>Bacillus thuringiensis
</I>(Bt) may also be helpful in reducing some caterpillar populations
in tomato fields.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Pest management may also include the release
of biological control agents to augment that which already exists
in the field.  For example, release of beneficial wasps of the
genus <I>Trichogramma </I>may help reduce certain caterpillar
populations.  Also, green lacewings (<I>Chrysopa </I>spp.) may
help reduce mite populations and soft bodied insects such as aphids.
 Additionally, some growers maintain insectary plantings in or
near fields to provide a habitat and food source for beneficial
arthropods while at the same time increasing the farm's biological
diversity.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> <B>Weeds.  </B>Optimal weed control for
organically produced tomatoes in the Sacramento Valley results
from the integration of a number of weed control techniques. 
Beds are mechanically cultivated prior to planting to remove many
weeds.  After planting, weeds are largely managed by tillage with
a sled type cultivator.  The total number and exact timing of
each cultivation is dependent on the crop's planting date, the
amount of soil moisture, the crop's stage of growth, and the crop's
ability to compete effectively with weeds.  Hand weeding is often
used in addition to mechanical cultivations.  Furthermore, weeds
should be removed from fields and field perimeters before seed
sets to reduce the total weed seed bank.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Flame weeders are also being utilized by
some growers to reduce weed populations before and after emergence
of direct seeded tomato crops.  Weeds are not actually burned
back by flaming; they are killed by desiccation when the plant's
cells burst upon exposure to the high temperatures that a flame
weeder produces.  Flame weeding is most effective when used on
broadleaf seedling weeds.  Volunteer grasses with protected growing
points are generally more difficult to eliminate with flame weeding.
 Since no soil disturbance occurs with flame weeding, additional
weed seeds are not brought to the soil surface for germination.</FONT>

<U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</FONT></B></U><B><FONT FACE="CG Times">:</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="CG Times">As
of January 1, 1992 growers who choose to produce and<I><B> </B></I>market
their crops as organic must register on a yearly basis with the
State of California under the California Organic Foods Act of
1990.  Enforced under this act are the provisions of Article 4.5
(commencing with Section 26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21
of the California Health and Safety Code and of the California
Food and Agricultural Code commencing with Section 46000.  These
provisions contain rules and regulations that must be adhered
to by all producers, processors and handlers of organic commodities.
 Currently, the act states that prior to January 1, 1995, producers
of organic commodities may not apply prohibited materials or substances
to annual or two-year crops for a minimum of twelve months prior
to seed planting or twelve months prior to the appearance of flower
buds for perennial crops to qualify as organic.  From January
1, 1995 through December 31, 1995, this rule increases to a twenty-four
month period of prohibition.  On or after January 1, 1996 the
restriction increases to thirty-six months.  State registration
fees apply.  Also, a one-time only initial registration fee is
assessed by the state.  Fees are payable before any sales of the
commodity occur and are based on projected estimates from a previous
year's gross receipts.  The state program is administered through
the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> On October 1, 1993, the federal Organic
Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) became effective.  This act
sets forth production standards and regulates all organic commodities
on the national level.  However, due to budget and time constraints,
final recommendations for the law's implementation have not been
completed.  Therefore, even though the law is now in place, implementation
and enforcement will be delayed for at least one year.  Nonetheless,
growers would be wise to conform to federal production standards
(in addition to state regulations) at this time.  The federal
program is administered through the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA).</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> In most cases the OFPA preempts state law
except in those cases where the state applies to the USDA for
approval of stricter standards.  Two differences between state
and federal laws are noteworthy.  First, the federal law stipulates
that organic foods must not be produced on land to which a prohibited
substance has been applied for a minimum of three years immediately
preceding harvest of the crop to qualify as organic.  Second,
federal law states that growers must be certified by a federally
accredited certifying agent on an annual basis if yearly gross
sales total more than $5,000.  This federal requirement should
not be confused with, and is separate from, state registration.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> In 1992 only one-third of the registered
organic farmers in California were certified by a certification
agency.  Approximately ninety percent of those certified were
certified by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).  In
addition to CCOF, five other organizations actively certify growers
in the state.  They are: Farm Verified Organic (FVO), the Organic
Crop Improvement Association (OCIA), the Organic Growers and Buyers
Association (OGBA), Quality Assurance International (QAI) and
Scientific Certification Systems (SCS).  Each agency should adhere
to all state and federal laws regulating organic commodities,
and in addition may enforce standards and procedures specific
to their own agencies.  Organizations differ with respect to the
certification process and the associated costs.  The above organizations
are registered with the State of California.  However, none are
currently accredited by the USDA since the USDA's certification
program has not yet been implemented.  Refer to the references

&amp; RETURN RANGES FOR ORGANIC PROCESSING TOMATOES</B></U><B>:</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Yields for organically grown processing
tomatoes range from 20-38 tons per acre.  This study assumes a
yield of 28 tons per acre in <B>Tables 1-3</B>.  Yields will vary
depending on cultivar selection and seasonal growing conditions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Prices received by growers of organic processing
are estimated at $75 per ton.  Returns to growers have been as
high as $125 and as low as $55 per ton in the past.  Current prices
now range from $72 to 75 per ton.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> For the hypothetical farm analyzed in this
study, with an average price of $75 per ton, net returns above
total costs are positive at a yield of 20.7 tons per acre.  At
a low price of $55 per ton the breakeven yield is 29.9 tons per
acre.  At a high price of $125 per ton the breakeven yield is
11.8 tons per acre.  Refer to <B><A HREF="#table-six">Table 6.</A>. Ranging Analysis </B>for
costs and returns at various prices and yields.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">9. <U><B>LABOR</B></U><B>:</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Basic hourly wages for workers are $6.61
and $4.83 per hour for machine operators and field workers, respectively.
 Adding 34% for workers compensation, social security, insurance
and other benefits increases the labor rates shown to $8.86 per
hour for machine labor and $6.47 per hour for non-machine labor.
 The labor hours for operations involving machinery are 20% higher
than the operations to account for extra labor involved in equipment
set-up, moving, maintenance and repair.  Wages for managers are
not included as a cash cost.  Any returns above total costs are
considered returns to management and risk.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">10. <U><B>CASH OVERHEAD</B></U><B>:</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Cash overhead consists of various cash
expenses paid out during the year that are assigned to the whole
farm and not to a particular operation.  These costs include,
but are not limited to, property taxes, interest on operating
capital, offices expenses, property and liability insurance and
investment repairs.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times"> </FONT></B><FONT FACE="CG Times">Counties
charge a base property tax rate of 1% on the assessed value of
the property.  In some counties special assessment districts exist
and additional taxes are charged on property including equipment,
buildings and improvements.  For this study, county taxes are
calculated as 1% of the average value of the property.  Average
value equals new cost plus salvage value divided by two on a per
acre basis.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Interest on operating capital is based
on cash operating costs and is calculated monthly until harvest
at a nominal rate of 7.89% per year.  A nominal interest rate
is the going market cost for borrowed funds.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Office and business expenses are estimated
at $30 per acre.  These expenses include office supplies, telephones,
bookkeeping, accounting, legal fees, road maintenance, etc.  Costs
for an agricultural consultant and/or pest control advisor (PCA)
are $18 per acre and are listed under professional services. 
Charges for soil tests and leaf analyses are included in this
cost.  Sanitation services provide portable toilets for field
workers and cost the farm $1,308 annually.  Crop insurance for
tomatoes is included at a cost of $36 per acre.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Insurance for farm investments varies depending
on the assets included and the amount of coverage.  Property insurance
provides coverage for property loss and is charged at 0.713% of
the average value of the assets over their useful life.  Liability
insurance covers accidents on the farm and costs $952 per year.
 Cash overhead costs are found in <B>Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 </B>and<B>
5.</B></FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">11. <U><B>NON-CASH OVERHEAD</B></U><B>:</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Non-cash overhead is comprised of depreciation
and interest charged on equipment and other investments.  Although
farm equipment is often purchased used, this study shows the current
purchase price for new equipment adjusted to 60% of the new value
to indicate a mix of new and used equipment.  Annual equipment
and investment costs are shown in <B>Tables 1, 2 </B>and<B> 4.
 </B>They represent depreciation and opportunity cost for each
investment on an annual per acre basis.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Depreciation is a reduction in market value
of investments due to wear, obsolescence and age and is on a straight
line basis.  Annual depreciation is calculated as the purchase
price minus the salvage value divided by the years the investment
is held.  The purchase price and years of life are shown in <B>Table
4.</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Interest is charged on investments to account
for income foregone (opportunity cost) that could be received
from an alternative investment.  The investments are assumed to
be owned outright.  Therefore, interest on investments is a non-cash
cost.  Investments include, but are not limited to, land, buildings
and equipment.  Interest is calculated as the average value of
the investment during its useful life, multiplied by a real interest
rate of 3.72% per year.  Average value for the equipment and buildings
equals the new cost plus the salvage value divided by two on a
per acre basis.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="CG Times">12. <U><B>EQUIPMENT CASH COSTS</B></U><B>:</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> Equipment costs are composed of three parts;
cash overhead, non-cash overhead and operating costs.  Both of
the overhead factors are detailed in previous sections.  The operating
costs consist of fuel, lubrication and repairs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times"> In allocating the equipment costs on a
per acre basis, the following hourly charges are calculated first
and shown in <B><A HREF="#table-five">Table 5</A></B>.  Repair costs are based on the purchase
price, annual hours of use, total hours of life and repair coefficients
formulated by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE).
 Fuel and lubrication costs are also determined by ASAE equations
based on maximum PTO horsepower (hp) and the type of fuel used.
 The fuel and repair costs per acre for each operation in <B><A HREF="#table-one">Table 1.</A></B> is determined by multiplying the total hourly operating
cost in <B><A HREF="#table-five">Table 5</A>.</B> for each piece of equipment used for the
cultural practice by the number of hours per acre for that operation.
 Tractor time is 10% higher than implement time for a given operation
to account for setup time.  Prices for on-farm delivery of diesel
and gasoline are $0.85 and $1.17 per gallon, respectively.</FONT>

 <U><B>ASSESSMENTS</B></U>:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">In this study, a stepped scale organic grower's
registration fee of $300 is assessed by the State of California
on the gross sales amount of $189,000.  The gross sales amount
is calculated by multiplying the yield of the crop per acre (28
tons) by the price received for the crop per ton ($75) and the
number of planted acres for the crop (90).  This is only an estimate
of potential fees and will vary depending on yields and returns.
 Contact the County Agricultural Commissioner in your area for
further details.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="CG Times">The grower is assumed to be certified by
California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).  Annual membership
fees are $175.  Inspection fees are $150.  Assessment fees are
.5% of a grower's gross sales and are included as a cost of production.
 Total CCOF assessments for 90 acres of tomatoes in this study
are $945.  Fees are based on the production amount, the number
of acres and parcels contained in an operation as well as whether
or not the farm is totally organic.  Therefore, individual situations
will vary.</FONT>

<P>
<A NAME = "Owls"><H2>Barn Owls</H2></A><P>
</A><FONT SIZE = "+3">T</FONT>he common barn
owl (<I>Tyto alba</I>) is often called the most beneficial bird in the world because of its hearty appetite for
voles, gophers, mice, and rats.  Several farmers have observed
that gopher populations are substantially reduced when sufficient
barn owl nesting sites are present on the farm.  Unfortunately,
little or no long-term research has been conducted to document an
effect on rodent populations by installing nest boxes.<P>

Each adult barn owl may consume about 1-2 rodents per night; a
nesting pair and their offspring can eat over 1,000 rodents per
year (Colvin, 1986).  The actual species taken depends in large
part on the species abundance in the area; in heavily farmed
areas, meadow voles and pocket gophers are often the main staple. 
Barn owls usually swallow their prey whole and later regurgitate
large pellets (usually one to two per day) containing undigested
bones, teeth, and fur.  Skulls found in these pellets can be
keyed out to determine the identity of the prey species.  The
prey species taken most often are California meadow voles, pocket
gophers, white-footed mice, and pocket mice (Ingels, 1995).<P>

Barn owls naturally nest and roost in barns, silos, haystacks in
barns, tree cavities, stream bank holes, and palm trees.  Nests
in haystacks are often destroyed when hay is removed and those in
palm trees are problematic, since the young owls often fall to
the ground during heavy winds.  Barn owls will readily take up
residence in nest boxes provided by farmers.  Some people have
stated that barn owl boxes should be installed at one box per 10
acres, but there is no scientific basis for this or any other
rate.<P>

The distance a barn owl will fly to hunt depends on the
availability of prey.  Depending on the availability of food
locally, barn owls often fly 1-2 miles or more to hunt each
night, and may fly up to 3.5 miles (Colvin 1986).  In a 1947
study in Davis, CA, researchers determined that a single barn owl
hunted over an area of only 165 acres (Evans and Emlen 1947).<P>


<H2><A NAME="Hawks">Hawks</A></H2>

Hawks can also aid in vertebrate pest management.  Important
species include the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and the
American kestrel, or sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius).  Red-tailed
hawks eat mostly ground squirrels, gophers, rabbits, birds and
small rodents, while kestrels eat small rodents, and grasshoppers
and other insects.  To encourage hawks, whose presence also
frightens starlings and other pest bird species, some farmers
install perches and nest boxes near their crops.  Perches may be
especially important in winter and early spring before the
rodents' breeding season, and when many crops are either absent
or provide little cover.
<P>
<B>Kestrel Houses</B><P>
Kestrels prefer to nest in dead trees and other crevices, but also use
secluded bulidings and wood raptor houses.  Open fields, meadows and
fence rows are good locations for kestrel houses.  Houses can be mounted
on utility poles, buildings, lone trees or posts.  According to Soil
Conservacion Service (SCS) bulletin, the house can be made of
long-lasting redwood or cedar, and should be mounted 10 to 15 feed from
the ground with the entrance clear of brances.  Because the house needs
to be checked and cleaned periodically, it should be erected where it can
be reached. Complete kestrel house plans are available from SCS. 
November through January is the best time to build a kestrel house. 
Houses should be checked weekly in the spring to make sure starlings and
other pest birds are not using the box.  Kestrels bring no nesting
material into the house, so any material found in the box is from pest
birds and should be removed.  Kestrel eggs are white/cinnamon colored
with spots of brown and hatch in about 28 days.  Starling eggs are pale blue. 
Screech owls, which may also use the boxes and are desirable birds, have
white eggs.  Kestrel houses should face south or east, and should be
located within 200 yards of a tall tree or pole because the raptors like
high perches nearby.

<H2><A NAME="Research"> Research Results</A> </H2><P>

<B>Davis Survey</B><P>
How effective are these perches and nest boxes, and how effective
are hawks in vertebrate pest management?  The data are mixed;
many growers report success, yet others contend that avian
predators alone cannot keep populations of meadow mice low for
extended periods of time because predators leave the area when
prey abundance is low.
<P>
Shawn Smallwood, a researcher in the Agronomy and Range Science
Department at UC Davis, recently completed a two year survey of
the use of perches by hawks.  The range of his survey spanned
over 200 miles in the Sacramento Valley, and included farms of
all major crops grown in the region.  The perch types studied
include artificial perches installed by farmers, trees, telephone
poles, and fenceposts.
<P>
Smallwood found that most hawks totally avoid the hawk perches
that farmers put up; only occasionally did he find a small hawk
using one of them.  Most hawks were found using telephone poles
or vertically-oriented "snags" on trees.  Hawks definitely prefer
large wood, according to Smallwood, upon which to rest their
whole body--they do not just like a small stick.  Another finding
was that the height of the perch was not as important as a
position with a broad view.  Large trees are ideal, but they are
best opened up a bit so they can see; dead limbs sticking up
above the leaves are used more than those within the canopy.
<P>
<B>Washington Orchard Study</B><P>

Researchers in Washington state conducted a study examining the
use and effectiveness of artificial perches and nest boxes. 
Three orchards in the Wenatchee area were used in the study. 
Researchers made direct observations and examined pellets.
<P>
In this study, none of the barn owl boxes and only 13 percent of
the kestrel boxes were inhabited.  However, more birds were
attracted to the orchards where perches were placed than those
without.  The biomass and height of the understory vegetation had
no bearing on the use of perches.  The effect of raptors on meadow mice 
populations was unclear; populations were reduced in one orchard
only.  However, the level of human activity may have also played
a major role.  Where houses and roads were most heavily used, few
birds visited the perches.  Human activity was minimal near the orchard
in which raptor use of perches was high and the mice population was
reduced.<P>

<B>Other Studies</B><P>

In an Oregon study, American kestrels and great-horned showed a
preference for 5 meter perches over 2.5 meter perches, but that
they accepted the shorter ones in the absence of taller ones. 
Barn owls did not show a height preference.
<P>
In another study, pest bird activity in vineyards was not
diminished with the use of perches.  While no hawks were observed
using the perches, four species were observed in the area and
trees and power poles were not far away.  Birds were not deterred
by hawk models on some of the perches.
<P>

<A NAME ="Box"><H2>Nest box construction and installation</H2></A><P>

Barn owls are cavity dwellers; they do not build nests.  They
will readily nest in sheltered structures larger than about 1 to
1 ft. in diameter.  Nest boxes can be built from on-farm
materials, such as barrels (see Ketner reference), beehives, and
raisin sweat boxes.  Nest boxes can also be constructed from
plywood.  Below are some design and installation suggestions for
building and installing barn owl nest boxes.  They are not strict
guidelines, but are only ideas which may the improve chances for
success in attracting barn owls.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Build the box at least 12 in. wide by 16 in. long by 16 in.
tall; even larger spaces are more conducive to the production of
large broods.

<LI>Use 0.5 in. plywood and use 1.5 in. galvanized nails and wood
glue to attach sides; alternatively, use dacronized screws and 2
in. x 2 in. framing boards where the sides join.

<LI>Make the entrance hole 6 or 7 in. wide and locate it near the
edge of the widest side rather than in the middle.

<LI>Provide a hinged door for removing old bedding and pellets.

<LI>Provide shading for the top and western exposures.  The
shading could be provided by plywood boards or simply by the
leaves and branches of a tree.  When boards are used, the top
baffle should extend over the sides several inches, especially
over the south side and over the entrance hole.  

<LI>Paint the box exterior and baffles white (or another light
color) to reflect heat and protect the wood.  Use two coats
initially, and repaint every few years.

<LI>Install the box at least 12-15 ft. high, but low enough to
allow easy access for cleaning.
Where possible, orient the box so that the entrance hole faces
east.  This reduces the exposure of the hole to hot summer sun
and to prevailing winds.
Provide a 1 in. thick layer of nesting material, such as wood
shavings or small wood chips, to prevent eggs from rolling.  In
the fall of each year, remove the old nesting material and add
new material.

<LI>Provide protection from predators.  One method is to wrap a 14
in. section of thin sheet metal around the tree trunk or post. 
Predators are usually unable to gain access if the box is
centered on top of the post or if a metal pipe is used as the
post.  Problem predators, which will eat eggs or young owls
include tree squirrels, opossums, and raccoons.

<LI>How can you tell if barn owls are nesting in the boxes?  Signs
that owls have inhabited the boxes include white excrement
("whitewash") below the entrance hole, pellets on the ground
below the box, and screeching and clicking sounds made by the
owls--as well as the owls themselves--near the box at night.  It
is best avoid disturbing the nest, especially when eggs are
present, since this may cause them to abandon the nest.  This
period is usually about late February through March for the first
brood.  However, eggs have been found in nests during most months
of the year except late fall/early winter.
</UL>
<P>
What if no barn owls inhabit the boxes?  Be patient.  They
usually begin looking for nesting sites in early January, so it
may take many months before they show any interest.  Also, they
may use the box for nesting only, abandoning it during the summer
and fall in favor of a tree or barn roost.  If you have installed
several boxes, it may take one or two years before they are all
inhabited.  Also, nest boxes may be abandoned as a result of the
high mortality rate of barn owls.  Fifty percent or more of all
barn owls may die in their first year, and collisions with
vehicles are usually the main cause of death.  If the box(es)
have not been occupied for up to two years, try using a different
box design and/or a different location.<P>

<H2>Grants available to farmers, researchers for biological farming systems 
</H2>
<P>
DAVIS -- Farmers, commodity groups and academic researchers are
encouraged to apply for a second round of grants to improve soil
fertility and crop protection with cultural practices and biological
pest control that reduce reliance on agricultural chemicals. Awards
ranging from $80,000 to $100,000 per year will be available for
one or more projects.
<P>
The UC Davis-based Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education
Program (SAREP) is administering the Biologically Integrated Farming
Systems (BIFS) pilot projects, the result of 1994 state legislation.
The first round of BIFS grants -- funded by Cal-EPA's Department
of Pesticide Regulation and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency -- supports ongoing projects in winegrapes and field crops.

<P>
&quot;New funding from the federal EPA and the University of California
Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources now permits us to
fund one or more additional projects,&quot; says SAREP Director
Bill Liebhardt. &quot;The core of BIFS projects is a team approach
to farm management, using farmers, consultants, UC farm advisors
and researchers, and independent pest-control advisers to farmers.&quot;
<P>
&quot;An increasing number of California farmers representing
many commodities and counties have been able to maintain yields
and quality while greatly reducing their reliance on agrichemicals,
including pesticides and synthetic fertilizers,&quot; says SAREP
Analyst Robert Bugg. The elements these farmers integrate into
their production systems include biological and cultural control
of pests; on-farm habitats for beneficial insects, mites and spiders;
a strong emphasis on soil-building practices, often including
biological nitrogen fixation to supply all or part of the nitrogen
needed by crop plants; and reduced reliance on agricultural chemicals.

<P>
Applicants for BIFS funds may employ additional techniques, such
as field monitoring for pest and beneficial organisms; collection
of weather data; reliance on research-based action thresholds;
use of selective biorational pesticides; and soil, water and plant-tissue
testing. &quot;BIFS grants are not necessarily limited to organic
farming systems,&quot; Bugg adds. &quot;Under this kind of management,
agrichemical programs are crafted carefully to integrate all these
elements.&quot;
<P>
New proposals for BIFS funding to study these farmers' production
systems are encouraged, Bugg says. The formal Request for Proposals
will be mailed the first week of January 1997. Proposals must
be received by UC SAREP no later
<P>
than April 2, 1997. California institutions and individuals are
invited to apply for funding. Principal investigators on BIFS
projects may be private individuals, for-profit and non-profit
corporations, including commodity boards, Resource Conservation
Districts, Natural Resources Conservation Service District or
soil conservationists, University of California Cooperative Extension
farm advisors, Cooperative Extension specialists, Area IPM Advisors,
and faculty of any accredited California institution of higher
learning. For more information, contact UC SAREP at (916) 752-7556.

<H2>UCD Unit Tackles Community Issues Via UC Research, Outreach
</H2>
<P>
Building local leadership, fortifying local government and strengthening
local economies are the goals of a new UC Davis program aimed
at focusing the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resource's
community development and outreach work, according to its director.
<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> says the
California Communities Program, a new Cooperative Extension program
within the UCD Department of Human and Community Development,
will emphasize collaborative work with other programs, both within
and outside UC. &quot;We see this as a great opportunity to focus
the knowledge and resources of the university on public service
that meets the needs of local communities,&quot; he says. Campbell,
who also works as the community development and public policy
analyst at the UC Davis-based statewide Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education Program (SAREP), hopes to expand on his
work linking sustainable agriculture to community economic development.
The California Communities Program will co-sponsor a community
food systems conference &quot;Sustaining Farms and People in the
Emerging Economy,&quot; Oct. 2-3, 1996 with SAREP, the Community
Alliance with Family Farmers, and the national Community Food
Security Coalition. For more information, media should contact

<H2>10 Years &amp; Still Funding Sustainable Ag&#133; </H2>
<P>
It's ten years old this year, and the UC-Davis based statewide
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP)
is gearing up for it's tenth year of grants. &quot;We've awarded
more than $2.8 million to approximately 200 basic and applied
research projects, economic and public policy projects, seminars
and field demonstrations and graduate student projects,&quot;
says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, SAREP
director. &quot;We're encouraged by all the organizations and
institutions both within and outside the university funding research
projects dealing with sustainability issues,&quot; he says. Liebhardt
says the increased pool of funding is important because California's
fiscal problems in the early 1990s has reduced the amount of money
available for SAREP grants. &quot;We're expecting to fund continuing
and new projects for about $190,000 this year,&quot; Liebhardt
says. The deadline for applications is August 1, 1996. The Request
for Proposals is available by mail or via the World Wide Web (<A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/</A>).
Contact SAREP at (916) 752-7556. Media should contact Liebhardt

<H2>Sustainable Agriculture in Cyberspace </H2>
<P>
How do you get information about sustainable farming practices
out to rural communities? The Davis-based UC Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education Program (SAREP) reaches out on the Internet
to farmers, farmworkers and consumers with data on biological
farming techniques, production and community food system projects,
as well as the program's newsletters, summaries of more than 100
SAREP-funded grants, requests for proposals for its two grant
programs, an extensive cover crops database and other computer
applications. Now in its tenth year, SAREP presents summaries
of recent grant projects and an introduction to its World Wide
Web server in the program's new Progress Report 1993-95, which
is itself available on the Internet at (<A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu </A>).
&quot;It's a challenge to get this useful information to the people
who need it,&quot; says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>,
SAREP associate director. &quot;On our World Wide Web home page
you can search on a word such as 'grapes' or 'rangeland' and find
everything on that topic-newsletter articles, projects we've funded,
and so forth. Plus, on the Web you can follow links from our articles
to related information at other sites with one click of the mouse
button. Already, two of the projects we've funded have their own
Web sites!&quot; Auburn stresses that SAREP information is available
in written and video formats, and local workshops have always
been an important way the statewide program communicates and collaborates
with farmers and consumers. For more information, media should
contact Auburn (jsauburn@ucdavis.edu) at (916) 754-8548. Tip By

<H2>Cover Crops : Farmers' Friends of the '90s </H2>
<P>
Cover crops: you were wondering about them? More and more, farmers
are planting vetch, subterranean clover, crimson clover, bur medic,
bell beans and plain old oats and cereal rye between orchard or
vineyard rows to improve soil quality and water penetration, and
to provide a biological source of nitrogen. The UC Davis-based
UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program's (SAREP)
new Progress Report 1993-95 is chock full of information on cover
crops: Details are available on at least seven cover crop-related
projects. &quot;Cover crops are major ingredients in many biologically
integrated farming systems,&quot; says SAREP analyst <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A>.
&quot;They're often the first biological technique farmers use,
and once they see their benefit, other related practices make
more sense to adopt.&quot; For more information, media should
contact Bugg at (916) 754-8549, <A HREF="mailto:rlbugg@ucdavis.edu">rlbugg@ucdavis.edu</A>.

A collection of English abstracts of Spanish-language sustainable
agriculture documents for farmworkers, entry-level farmers and
farm advisors or consultants who work with them is available from
the UC Davis-based UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Program (SAREP). Most of the 74 publications were chosen so that
individuals with primary or secondary education can read them,
says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>, SAREP
food systems analyst and nutritionist who coordinated the project
with editor Beatriz Cabez&oacute;n. Farm advisors and others who
work with Spanish-speaking farmers and farmworkers will be able
to use these resources to do outreach and educational programs
about sustainable farming practices with their clientele, Feenstra
says. The abstracts cover a wide range of topics, from the principles
of sustainability to practical information about soil and water
management, agricultural machinery, field safety, and learning
English as a second language. SAREP has established libraries
for the original Spanish documents at five strategic sites in
California including the Small Farm Center at UCD, the farm advisors'
offices in San Diego and Fresno, at UC Santa Barbara, and at the
Rural Development Center in Salinas. A Spanish version of the

is a general term for farms which have a direct relationship with
a community of consumers, Feenstra says. The individual farms
are called CSAs, and they actively involve the public with the
people who grow food. Community gardens and CSAs can bring homeless
people, welfare recipients and other marginalized groups back
into their communities through local food, Feenstra adds. The
Davis-based Small Farm Center and SAREP are among the conference

cursor at the words &quot;critical component research.&quot; The
Web allows electronic visitors to &quot;step into&quot; descriptions
of SAREP funded research projects on all these topics. &quot;We
have this information available in hard copy, but it's great to
have another way to get detailed research data out,&quot; says
Jill Shore Auburn, SAREP's associate director. A researcher can
download the &quot;Dairy Debate&quot; stack for Macintosh computers
and find out about bovine growth hormone. The dates and times
of SAREP sponsored meetings on field crops, landscape issues or
other topics are listed. There's &quot;downloadable&quot; software
for a cover crop database, lists of publications and videos, and
information on back issues of the program's quarterly newsletter.

Farmers looking for more markets for their produce and consumers

to &quot;community supported agriculture,&quot; says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>,
food systems analyst for the UC Davis-based UC Sustainable Agriculture

buy &quot;subscriptions&quot; from nearby farmers, allowing farmers

is a tremendous interest on the part of both consumers and farmers
in making that direct link,&quot; says Feenstra, who is helping
to plan a major conference on community supported farming in the
fall. Subscription farming began in Western Europe and Japan in
the mid-1960s, first appeared in the US in the mid-1980s, and
has recently been gathering momentum in California. &quot;The
number of farmers participating and consumers being served is
growing exponentially,&quot; Feenstra says, noting that a grower

Orchards </H2>

A visiting Swedish scientist and researchers at UCD and UC Santa
Cruz have confirmed that foot-long nightcrawlers (also known as
fish bait or Lumbricus terrestris) move and decompose mown cover
crops more rapidly than other earthworms commonly found in orchards.
Birgitta R&#132;mert of the Swedish University of Agricultural
Science in Uppsala, in close collaboration with Robert Bugg of
the UCD-based UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Program, Alison Berry and Robert McGuinn of the UCD Environmental
Horticulture Department, and Matt Werner of the Center for Agroecology
and Sustainable Food Systems at UCSC, introduced nightcrawlers
to the Winters walnut orchard of Russell Lester. &quot;The nightcrawlers
are able to move the mown cover crop into their eight-foot deep
burrows and decompose it more rapidly than the resident earthworms,&quot;
according to Bugg. &quot;This work is significant particularly
for farmers who are trying to reduce tillage in their orchards.&quot;
Bugg noted that the researchers were pleased to be able to formally
demonstrate in the field what has been shown in the lab and observed
in orchards. [Field sampling and statistical analyses are complete,
and a manuscript is now in preparation for submission to Soil
Biology And Biochemistry.] Media should contact Bugg at (916)

How do farm advisors, college professors, ag professionals and
school teachers integrate sustainable agriculture into the educational
programs offered to their clients and students? What teaching
methods are best for sustainable ag concepts and practices? How
can sustainable ag education organizations coordinate their programs?
These are among the questions to be answered in workshop sessions
and at an information fair Nov. 22, 1996 at the UC Davis Buehler
Alumni Center. Sponsored by the UC Davis-based statewide Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP), the daylong
event is designed to help Extension personnel and other educators
understand and apply the concepts and practices of sustainable
agriculture, and get to know the many California organizations
involved in these issues. &quot;I am impressed with the variety
and quality of sustainable ag education taking place in California,&quot;
says David Chaney, SAREP education coordinator. &quot;We are looking
forward to hearing about them and discussing new educational opportunities
that build on these programs.&quot; A new directory of educational
programs and instructional resources for California will be available
at the conference, Chaney says, as well as in searchable form
through the SAREP World Wide Web site at <A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu</A>.

<H3>California Environmental Policy Plans</H3>
<P>
<I>Our Blueprint for Future:  Safeguarding California's Environment</I>,
prepared by the California Senate Office of Research, <B>Elizabeth
Kersten</B>, director.  Contributors include project coordinator
and former SAREP PAC member <B>Bruce Jennings</B>, <B>Buzz Breedlove</B>,
<B>Dan Flynn</B>, <B>Dean Misczynski</B>, <B>Steve Sanders</B>
and <B>Martha Valdes</B>.  The January 1991 34-page report is
edited by <B>Rebecca LaVally</B>, and is a collection of environmental
blueprints &quot;intended to foster discussion, debate and action
to improve California's environmental policies and protections.&quot;
Topics include pollution prevention, environmental health, ecological
farming, market approaches to pollution control, managing growth,
preserving open space, traffic congestion, and coastal protection.
 Order Publication No. 548-S from Senate Reprographics, 1100 J
St. Room B10, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 322-3397.  The price
is $4.73, tax included.  Make checks payable to the State of California.
<H3>Hunger Identification Project</H3>
<P>
<I>Hunger in the Heartland:  Community Childhood Hunger Identification
Project in California's Central Valley</I>, produced by the California
Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, March 1991.  A 47-page report
documenting the serious problem of poverty and hunger for the
children of California's Fresno, Kings, Stanislaus, and Tulare
counties.  &quot;This 'shadow society' includes over 86,000 households
living in poverty.  Sixty percent of them are Hispanic, and most
are children, who often go to bed hungry, whose parents skip meals
so their children can eat.&quot;  The study is part of a national
survey of hunger among children-the Community Childhood Hunger
Identification Project-which uses a scientifically rigorous questionnaire
developed by the Connecticut Association for Human Services. 
Interviews were conducted in 1990 by interviewers speaking the
languages of the 335 randomly selected families.  Nine other states
conducted similar surveys under the auspices of Food Research
and Action Center in Washington, DC. Producers of the California
survey hope that their work will provoke action in this state
&quot;where the state's rich agricultural heritage stands in stark
contrast to the reality that thousands of children in the Central
Valley do not have enough to eat.&quot;  For copies of the $10
report, contact the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation,
2111 Mission Street, Suite 401, San Francisco, CA 94110, (415)

<P>
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation has established a new grant program
called the Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) Initiative.  It will
provide support for community-based projects that aim to: 1) help
farmers adopt resource-efficient, productive, profitable, integrated
crop and livestock systems that protect the environment and health
of farm families; and 2) help people and communities overcome
barriers to the adoption of more sustainable agricultural systems
which can serve to revitalize rural American communities.  Two
to three page concept papers for creative new projects in IFS
will be accepted until September 1, 1992.  Concept papers should
include objectives, intended impacts, the &quot;community&quot;
involved, major collaborators, activities needed to meet objectives,
plans to evaluate the project, a time frame, and an estimated

<H1><U><I>From the Director</I></U> - Land Grant System: Help
Farmers Change<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Previously I have discussed the need for agriculture to set its
own agenda and what farmers can do on their own farms to face
the current transition in California agriculture. These two ideas
reflect a new and changing goal for agriculture.
<H3>New Goal</H3>
<P>
In the past, our goal was to produce abundant food at reasonable
prices. Agriculture was very successful - that goal has clearly
been met. Now, however, there is debate about how agricultural
production is achieved: how farmers farm. This reflects a change
in emphasis in agriculture's goal. The new goal is to produce
food and fiber at reasonable costs while  maintaining  the  natural
resource base and safeguarding the environment. The new goal makes
sense, assuming that agricultural production will continue to
be based on natural and man-made inputs derived from a resource
base that must be used by future generations.
<H3>Land Grant System</H3>
<P>
Society and growers are increasingly changing their view of what
they want from agriculture. The new goal of reasonably priced,
environmentally-sound production will directly affect universities
throughout the country. The question for us in the land grant
system is: How do we help meet the new goal?<BR>
<P>
Both short-term and long-term questions about this issue require
discussion. The short-term questions relate to the fact that California
growers are facing a transition involving farming practices, regulations
and marketing. The pace of legislative changes, consumers' changing
desires, and chemical company actions have the potential to rapidly
alter production tools now available to farmers.
<H3>Short-term goals</H3>
<P>
For the short-term, we must help growers address this rapidly
changing regulatory environment.  In many cases this means finding
alternatives for herbicides, insecticides, and nematicides presently
in use. As farmers are called upon to be flexible and open-minded,
we in the land grant system must be flexible, open-minded and
<B>creative</B> so we can help growers find new management strategies
to produce the food and fiber our society needs.<BR>
<P>
We must take the lead in helping growers as they work to change
their production systems. We must help them develop new cultural,
biological, mechanical, and chemical pest control practices where
appropriate.<BR>
<P>
We need to be willing to consider almost any option that has potential,
as the entire agricultural industry is part of a picture that
is changing fast. We must also consider preventative strategies,
rather than those solely designed to treat problems. Preventative
approaches suggest that soil, water, and cultural management may
be related to a plant's ability to resist or succumb to pests.
<H3>Long-term goals</H3>
<P>
Long-term goals that will help agriculture address these changes
must be explored, including the development of more pest-resistant
plants. In many production systems, there are two or three key
pests which must be managed in order to achieve a successful crop.
Environmentally-sound control of these pests is often not possible
based on present knowledge. A longer time commitment is necessary
to provide these answers: Long-term research is essential. Long-term
funding is a major problem for universities across the country,
and is an issue that must be addressed if we are to reach society's
new goal for agriculture.<BR>

<H1>Free Diskette of Research Project Summaries</H1>
<P>
<I>(Editor's note: The following article is by <B>V Philip</B>
<B>Rasmussen, </B>professor and chair of the Agricultural Systems
Technology Department, Utah State University.  In formation has
been added to assist California readers in ordering disks.)<BR>
</I>
<P>
We announce the release of the Folio InfoBase of project summaries
of the United States Department of Agriculture Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education program (USDA-SARE).  The disk includes
all projects reported from the four USDA-Cooperative State Research
Service regions for the past three years.  In addition, it includes
reports of the Environmental Protection Agency-USDA &quot;ACE&quot;
research and education program (Agriculture in Concert with the
Environment).  This InfoBase demonstrates how quickly sustainable
agriculture information can be retrieved through computer database
systems.<BR>
<P>
InfoBases provide an extremely cost effective and easy way of
distributing information.  A Folio InfoBase is a unique and unprecedented
form of data storage and retrieval unlike most flat-file or relational
data base systems.  An InfoBase is a stand-alone file of text
information (usually compiled from standard word-processed files
such as WordPerfect, Wordstar, Word, etc.) wherein each word is
pre-indexed.  In addition, an InfoBase is compressed so that it
occupies much less disk space than the file from which it was
derived.  InfoBases can easily be distributed as run-time versions,
relieving end users of the need to have Folio software to use
the InfoBase.  Hence, it is ideally suited to applications where
users are given a disk and instructions, but do not have access
to any particular data base program.<BR>
<P>
Thus, there are major advantages of an InfoBase over a system
such as dBase or Paradox.  For example:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The system does not require any pre-determined structure-any
ASCII or word-processed file is usable.
<LI>Original text is compressed and occupies much less space than
a word-processed file.
<LI>All original text (though compressed) is readily available
as text and can be cut and pasted from within the InfoBase for
transfer to new word-processed files.
<LI>InfoBases can be distributed as run-time modules so that users
do not need to purchase any special software.
<LI>InfoBases operate efficiently on existing IBM-compatible platforms
including XTs so there is no need to purchase new hardware.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The power of an InfoBase is tapped when the user presses the keyboard
space bar to do a global text search.  For example, to search
for all occurrences of the word &quot;alfalfa&quot; in an InfoBase
of research abstracts, simply press the space bar and type &quot;<B>a</B>.&quot;
 Immediately, the InfoBase narrows the search and finds all words
that begin with &quot;a.&quot;  Finish typing &quot;<B>lfalfa</B>&quot;
and the InfoBase might indicate that there are 22 occurrences
of &quot;alfalfa&quot; in the InfoBase.  If &quot;<B>alfalfa weevil</B>&quot;
is typed, powerful Boolean logic options collate the information
and might reveal that there are 22 occurrences of &quot;alfalfa&quot;
and 33 occurrences of &quot;weevil&quot; and 5 occurrences of
both &quot;alfalfa&quot; and &quot;weevil&quot; in the same project.
<BR>
<P>
We believe that InfoBase systems represent one of the most important
developments in fast information transfer of the past decade.
 We are not necessarily endorsing the product, nor is the USDA,
Environmental Protection Agency, or the Sustainable Agriculture
Network.  However, we do think it represents a class of hypertext
technology that could revolutionize how we search for information
to help us in our sustainable agriculture management efforts.
<BR>
<P>
To request a copy of the SAN InfoBase, please send us a blank,
formatted, 3.5 or 5.25 inch, high density IBM compatible disk
and a self-addressed mailing label.  From California, send it
to: SAN Infobase, do <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Auburn</A></B>, Info. Group, SAREP, University
of California, Davis, CA 95616. From outside California, send
it to: <B>Phil Rasmussen</B>, Chair, Agricultural Systems Technology
Dept., Utah State University, Logan UT 84321.<BR>
<P>
The program includes a run-time search capability so you do not
need any additional programs to operate it.  Just insert it into
an IBM compatible high density drive and type SAN.<BR>

<H1>More On-Farm Research: Another Approach</H1>
<P>
<I>Jill Auburn, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>In Sustainable Agriculture News</B> (Vol. 3 No. 2, Winter 1991,
<I>On-Farm Research &amp; the Transition), </I>we reviewed conventional
concepts of experimental design and analysis that may be useful
for on-farm experiments.  Those methods are appropriate for studying
the effects of experimental treatments, assuming that the measurements
taken in different plots are spatially independent.  Common sense
tells us, however, that measurements taken nearby one another
in a field might be related.  By ignoring that possible relation,
the conventional approach &quot;throws away information about
patterns in space and time,&quot; according to <B>Don Nielsen</B>,
UC Davis professor of Land, Air and Water Resources and chair
of the agronomy and range science department.  Nielsen introduced
SAREP staff to geostatistics, an approach not usually used in
what he terms &quot;aggie&quot; statistics.<BR>
<H3>Basic Concepts</H3>
<P>
This article presents some basic geostatistical concepts drawn
from Nielsen's presentation to SAREP staff and from a paper by
Nielsen, Tillotson and Vieira (1983).  It is an overview and introduction
to the concepts and some of their applications, rather than a
thorough guide to   using these method.<BR>
<P>
Most  growers  are aware of the variability of their fields, and
may therefore be skeptical of the applicability of some experimental
results.  Researchers are aware of this variability too, but they
haven't had the tools to include it in their experiments.  Geostatistical
methods provide additional tools to describe and analyze spatial
variability.  These methods involve intensive sampling along a
line or in a grid pattern, rather than in randomized, replicated
treatments.<BR>
<P>
Geostatistics is important to sustainable agriculture in two ways.
 First, geostatistical methods can improve researchers' ability
to lay out experimental plots and take samples more effectively.
Researchers usually try to put their field experiments in representative
areas in a field.  They also choose plot sizes that seem large
enough to ensure independence between plots, yet are not so large
that each plot contains too much variability.  Geostatistics can
provide a basis for making these decisions more soundly.<BR>
<P>
Secondly, many growers want to know why plants in a particular
field, or area of the field, are healthier than others.  They
also want ways to predict where in the field a problem may occur.
 Conventional research designs have determined many factors that
affect plant health and productivity, but they are able to study
only a limited number of variables at a time.  As a consequence,
it has often been left to the grower to determine how these factors
interact in the field. Geostatistics can be used to describe and
monitor plant and soil health characteristics as they occur together
in the field.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Spatial Autocorrelation</H3>
<P>
Common sense tells us that the similarity between a sample point
and its neighbor decreases as the two points become farther apart.
 The spatial autocorrelation coefficient is a way to quantify
this relationship:  it expresses the relatedness of points separated
by an interval of space along a transect.  It is always 1.0 at
a distance of zero (that is, points are perfectly correlated with
themselves), and drops off as the number of intervals between
points being correlated increases. The autocorrelogram is a plot
of the autocorrelation coefficient versus number of intervals.
 If it drops off steeply, there is little spatial relationship
among points, on the scale being used.  If it drops off gradually,
it is possible to estimate from one point the expected values
at neighboring points.  Spatial autocorrelation describes spatial
dependence, or how a soil or crop characteristic changes across
a field.  One of its uses is to determine the required spacing
of samples along a transect (or line) so that intermediate values
can be interpolated.  For example, if your field includes two
or more soil types, how many samples do you have to take to make
sure you have an accurate picture of the field?  Spatial autocorrelation
can also be used to determine the size of field plots and the
spacing of samples in conventional experimental designs.  Without
measuring spatial dependence, you don't know for sure that measurements
taken in different plots are independent of one another, that
a sample taken within a plot is representative of the entire plot,
or even that the area in the field chosen for the experiment is
representative of the whole field.
<H3>Spatial Cross-Correlation</H3>
<P>
Usually we are interested in more then one variable - for example,
how are soil compaction and plant growth related across the field?
<BR>
<P>
A conventional correlation coefficient describes the relationship
between two variables as if it were the same across the field.
 By contrast, spatial cross-correlation expresses the relationship
between two variables in a series (when both are sampled along
a line across a field.)  Like the spatial autocorrelation, the
cross-correlation is calculated for each of several intervals
between the two variables.  When the interval is zero, the spatial
correlation is the same as the conventional correlation coefficient;
if a significant correlation persists as the interval between
the two variables is increased (i.e., one measurement away, two
measurements away, etc. along the line),  a relationship exists
between the two variables over a larger area than the size of
each sample.  Spatial cross correlation is important when one
of the variables is difficult or expensive to measure.  In our
example, soil compaction may be more difficult to measure than
plant growth.  Soil compaction can be predicted by plant growth
measurements if they are known to be spatially correlated.
<H3>Spectral Analysis</H3>
<P>
Spectral analysis is used to look for regularly repeating patterns
across time or space, such as might be found across a field where
rows of crop plants occur at regular intervals.  In spectral analysis,
the power spectrum (variance as a function of the frequency of
cycles) is plotted.  Peaks in this spectrum correspond to distances
over which cycles repeat.  In an example by Nielsen (Figure 1),
average soil water content was sampled across a field where a
crop had been previously grown along furrows one meter apart.
 Spectral analysis of the data showed significant peaks corresponding
to one meter (furrow spacing), two meters (tractor tire spacing),
and ten meters (pre-plant border irrigation, or some other traffic
pattern.)  The significant peak at the two-meter spacing shows
a significant effect of tractor traffic (soil compaction) on soil
water content.  If the peak corresponding to the two-meter spacing
had not been significant, the conclusion would have been that
tractor traffic was not significantly affecting soil water content
in this field.<BR>
<P>
This example illustrates a geostatistical approach to this question.
 Alternatively, the problem could have been approached using conventional
analysis of data from replicated plots containing furrows, tractor
tracts, etc.  The plots would have to be laid out with this pattern
in mind.  An advantage of spectral analysis is that it identifies
spatial patterns that the researcher may not know about beforehand.
<H3>Cospectral Analysis</H3>
<P>
Cycles or regularly repeating patterns in the relationship between
two variables are shown through cospectral analysis, in which
the covariance between two variables is plotted as a function
of frequency.  Peaks in the cospectrum may identify relationships
among two variables in a more sensitive way than conventional
correlations of the independent samples, especially when the relationship
between the two variables changes across space.  The relationships
between the abundances of predator and prey insects across an
orchard may vary, for example, between orchard floor and tree
canopy, or even in a more subtle pattern moving across the two
zones.  Conventional methods could be used to identify the relationship
in different areas, for example by taking measurements in replicated
plots in both orchard floor and canopy.  The researcher would
have to know beforehand, however, where to place the plots to
pick up these effects.  The advantage of the geostatistical approach
is that it can identify spatial patterns whether or not the researcher
knows about them beforehand.<BR>
<P>
The effect of management variable might be studied by arranging
plots in a regularly repeating pattern across space, analyzing
the data with cospectral analysis.  Thus the regular plot layout
that was described as inappropriate for conventional statistics
in our article in the last <B>Sustainable Agriculture News</B>
(in which treatments were arranged A-B-C-A-B-C-A-B-C) <B>would</B>
be appropriate for cospectral analysis.
<H3>Other Methods</H3>
<P>
There are many more methods beyond the scope of this article:
 The Nielsen paper describes cospectral phase angles and coherence
(for relationships between variables whose cycles are out of phase
with one another); semivariograms (another approach to describing
spatial dependence of neighboring observations); and kriging (interpolating
missing points using information from the semivariogram).  The
other references listed below describe even more methods.
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
Geostatistical methods can describe patterns in space and time
which are, too often, ignored in conventional analysis.  These
methods may allow us to address questions that are difficult or
more expensive to answer with conventional &quot;aggie&quot; statistics.
 Some of these questions are particularly important to sustainable
agriculture, where we often ask &quot;what are the characteristics
of a healthy system?&quot;<BR>
<P>
Geostatistical methods can also enhance our ability to design
conventional experiments by providing information about spatial
dependence that can be used to determine the appropriate size
and layout of experimental plots.  No statistical method is a
panacea, however.  Both conventional and geostatistical methods
require that you design the project with an understanding of the
system being studied and the method of analysis being used.<BR>

<P>
UC SAREP is required by California's 1986 Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education Act to have both public and technical advisory
committees to advise the university on program goals and make
recommendations on competitive grant awards. The Public Advisory
Committee (PAC) includes individuals actively involved in agricultural
production, as well as representatives from government, public
organizations, and institutions of higher education. The Technical
Advisory Committee (TAC) is made up of universitywide faculty
and staff with knowledge and experience related to sustainable
agriculture and makes recommendations about the scientific merit
of grant applications. Each PAC or TAC member serves for three
years. 
<P>
In the last quarter of 1995, <B>Andrew Rubin</B> joined the Public
Advisory Committee. Rubin is a staff toxicologist in the Medical
Toxicology Branch, Department of Pesticide Regulation, California
Environmental Protection Agency (Cal-EPA). His areas of expertise
include cell biology (neoplastic transformation, progression),
and pesticide toxicology. He is particularly interested in the
uses and misuses of genetic technology in agriculture, and the
role of pesticides in extractive and non-extractive agriculture.

<P>
Nestled in the lush evergreens of  California's north coast lies
a tiny farm that is making a big impact on the lives of people
in the surrounding community. <B>Janet Czarnecki</B>, education
and outreach coordinator for the Arcata Farm and Education Project,
is excited about the new connections the project has made with
the Arcata community since mid-1993. The Arcata Project, funded
by SAREP in two grants totaling approximately $26,000 from 1992-1994,
is a student-operated, community supported farm designed to serve
as a sustainable agriculture educational facility for students,
community members and farmers. It has served as an innovative
model of community education about sustainable agriculture in
Arcata. <BR>

<H3>CSA Begins</H3>

<P>
The project's most recent development has been the initiation
of a new CSA-a community supported agriculture project or a &quot;subscription
farm&quot;-on the project's 2 1/2 acre farm. (In CSAs, farmers
sell directly to a consumers who agree to buy &quot;shares&quot;
in the farmer's harvest in advance- see &quot;Small Farmers Jam
Subscription' Farming Conference, page 4.) The CSA started in
October 1993 with ten 10-week shares and 15 shareholders. This
core group enthusiastically supported the CSA through the fall
by sharing recipes, writing newsletters and organizing potlucks.
The CSA members also enjoyed an additional &quot;soup share&quot;
for the month of January: They were invited to the farm to pick
any root crops, cabbages and greens (kale, chard) for a donation.
In that manner the extra crops in the fields were used instead
of being composted, and members were able to maintain their connection
with the farm. The spring summer CSA season began in late spring
(after the &quot;mud and floating gardens&quot; subsided) and
will run until September or October Czarnecki says the Arcata
Farm CSA will expand to 20 to 40 shareholders at that time. Community
support has been enthusiastic and essential for the success of
the Arcata Farm project in all of its outreach activities, she
notes. 
<H3>University Classes</H3>

<P>
In addition to being the site of the CSA, the Arcata Farm is also
the location of California State University, Humboldt's sustainable
agriculture classes, coordinated by farm director <B>Susan Toms</B>.
The lecture and field work class as well as a field practicum
taught by <B>Jon McNally</B> and <B>Andrew</B> <B>Rahn</B>, are
extremely popular and successful with the students, according
to Toms. <BR>

<P>
The Arcata Farm and Education Project and the City of Arcata cooperate
to produce public composting workshops. Additionally, Arcata Farm
personnel work with <B>Deborah Giraud</B>, UC Cooperative Extension
farm advisor, to teach community classes including winter gardening,
strawberry culture and spring topics. <BR>

<P>
Czarnecki has been working with teachers and students at the Sunnybrae
Middle School, a public school, and Equinox, a local private school,
to develop lessons about sustainable agriculture for the science
curriculum. She leads both classroom activities and outdoor experiences
to teach the children about the health of the soil, compost building,
cover cropping, and local food production. Some of the classes
take place at the Arcata Farm, located across the creek from the
Sunnybrae Middle School. She is also developing school gardens
at both sites. 
<H3>Hmong Poultry Project</H3>

<P>
In addition to community gardeners, university students and school
children, the Arcata Farm is also used by a community of Hmong
refugees. The Hmong are developing a special poultry project in
which they will build a traditional Hmong-style poultry house
for Asian chickens. They are using a small plot of land for the
poultry house and for growing varieties of Asian vegetables for
their families. People at the Arcata Farm look forward to sharing
culturally diverse farming techniques and different foods. <BR>

<P>
The Arcata Project has given many different people in the community
the opportunity to learn about sustainable agriculture and is
directly connecting people with their food supply. It is a wonderful
model for other communities interested in building community around
sustainable agriculture. <P>

<P>
Ten continuing research and education projects focusing on production
and social, economic and public policy issues in sustainable food
and agricultural systems have been awarded $117,021 in additional
grant money from UC SAREP this year. <BR>

<P>
<B>Steve Temple</B>, Agronomy &amp; Range Science, UC Davis: $25,000.
This interdisciplinary comparison of conventional, low-input and
organic management of a processing tomato-based cropping system
is entering its sixth year, funded by SAREP and the USDA's SARE
program. See <I>Sustainable Agriculture</I> Vol. 5, No. 4 (Summer
1993) for a recent update. <BR>

<P>
<B>Peter Lehman</B> and <B>Susan Toms,</B> Engineering and International
Development Technology, Humboldt state University, Arcata, CA:
$14,487. The <A HREF="http://www.knobul.com:80/knobul/aef.html">Arcata Farm and Education Project</A> has created a student-operated,
community-supported two acre farm in the city of Arcata to be
used for sustainable agriculture projects by students, community
members and local farmers. <BR>

<P>
<B>Monica Moore</B>, Pesticide Action Network, San Francisco,
CA and <B>Angus Wright</B>, Dept. of Environmental Studies, California
state University, Sacramento, CA: $9,500. This project has drafted
a pesticide use reduction policy for California in consultation
with 46 people throughout California, based on European and other
relevant experiences. This year's funding is being used to broaden
the discussion beyond the initial 46 cooperators, and to further
develop approaches to financial incentives for growers, and funding
mechanisms for implementing a pesticide reduction policy. <BR>

<P>
<B>Desmond Jolly</B>, Extension Agricultural Economist, UC Davis
and <B>Stan Dundon,</B> Dept. of Philosophy, California state
University, Sacramento, CA: $7,340. This project has reviewed
literature, programs and projects on applied ethics, and begun
drafting a text on agricultural ethics, including case studies.
Second-year funding will be used to complete the text, instructor's
manual and related articles, and to hold several workshops with
producers, farm advisors, and others. <BR>

<P>
<B>Steven Koike</B>, Monterey County farm advisor: $4,530. Koike
and his colleagues have tested several cover crop species for
their susceptibility to the lettuce drop pathogen, and the effects
of cover crop incorporation on subsequent lettuce plantings. Preliminary
findings from the first year showed that vetch, Phacelia and Austrian
pea may increase soil inoculum and disease in the subsequent crop.
A second year of research is necessary to confirm or refute these
findings. <BR>

<P>
<B>Kent Daane</B>, Laboratory of Biological Control, UC Berkeley
and Kearney Agricultural Center: $14,487. This project is studying
the effects of cover crops, time of cover crop plowdown, and trellis
system on spiders and other predators of the variegated leafhopper,
a critical pest in Central Valley vineyards. Pests and beneficial
insects are being monitored in large, replicated plots in two
commercial vineyards. <BR>

<P>
<B>Bill Williams</B> and <B>Craig Thomsen</B>, Agronomy and Range
Science, UC Davis: $8,700. Dryland legumes are being evaluated
for pasture, range, vineyard and farming systems in Northern California.
Dozens of legumes (annual medics, subterranean clovers, and others),
replicated three times, are being evaluated at ten or more sites
for establishment, vigor, percent cover, weed suppression, recovery
following grazing, and/or regeneration. <BR>

<P>
<B>Elizabeth Mitcham</B>, Pomology, UC Davis: $11,730. Postharvest
hot water immersion treatments are being explored for their potential
as a non-chemical alternative for control of certain diseases
and physiological disorders of fruits. See p. 8 for details. 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Donald Phillips</B>, Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis:
$15,000. Flavonoids are natural compounds which have recently
been found to promote the growth of beneficial soil bacteria and
fungi. This project looked for flavonoids and other natural chemical
signals in soil from California, Oregon, and Great Britain where
different crop and soil management practices have been in place
for many years. Year Two funds will be used to identify the chemical
structures of signals extracted from soil during Year One, and
to develop a microbial assay to define the biological activity
of plant signals in soil. <BR>

<P>
<B>Lonnie Hendricks</B>, Merced County farm advisor: $5,750. Building
on his previous SAREP funded research, Hendricks continues to
monitor six innovative almond orchards for leaf nutrient levels,
beneficial insects, pests, insect damage to nuts, soil organic
matter and earthworms. Ten cover crop mixes are being evaluated
in one of the orchards for effects on soil organic matter, tree
nutrient status, pests and beneficials. <BR>

<H3>Pesticide Use Tops 161 Million Pounds </H3>

<P>
Since the 1990 &quot;100 Percent Reporting&quot; rule took effect,
all pesticide use in California must be reported to the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation. According to the latest California
Department of Pesticide Regulation survey, over 90 percent of
the 161 million pounds of pesticide used in 1991 in the state
were in agricultural production. Three crops accounted for roughly
one-third of the total use (in millions of pounds): grapes (37.6),
cotton (10.4), and sugar beets (8.7). Sulfur, a naturally occurring
chemical element which is considered organic, is included in the
survey and ranked as the most-used pesticide, at 49.5 million
pounds. California's three leading agricultural counties also
lead the state in pesticide use reported (in millions of pounds):
Fresno (23.3), Kern (17.6), and Tulare (12.4). For more information
see<I> Rural</I> <I>California</I> <I>Report</I>, Newsletter of
the California Institute for Rural Studies, Summer 1993, p.5.
Copies of the state's printed pesticide reports are available
in two volumes, one indexed by commodity, the second by chemical.
To order, send $25 to: Cashier, California Department of Pesticide
Regulation, Information Services Branch, 1220 N Street, P.O. Box
942871, Sacramento, CA 94271-0001. For information on the fall
computerized database of the reports, call the DPR Information
Services Branch, (916) 654-1353. <BR>

<H3> Marin Ag Land Trust Saves Farmland </H3>

<P>
Thirteen years after it was formed, the Marin Agricultural Land
Trust (MALT) is being recognized as a model for protecting farmland.
MALT, a non-profit, membership-supported organization, conserves
farmland by purchasing conservation easements. Easements usually
represent the difference between the property's market value and
its value when development rights have been removed. They are
purchased in a legal agreement requiring property owners to permanently
keep their land in agriculture and open space. By June 1993, MALT
easements had protected 22,098 acres of farmland on 33 properties.
For more information, see &quot;Anyone for a MALT?,&quot;<I> American
Farmland: The Magazine of American Farmland Trust, </I>Summer
1993, pp.18-20.<BR>

<H3>Bovine Hormone (BGH) Moratorium </H3>

<P>
A 90-day moratorium on the marketing and use of bovine growth
hormone (bGH) has been put in place by the U.S. Congress, and
a seven-year ban on the hormone has been recommended by the European
Commission. The U.S. moratorium will ban bGH use, sales, and marketing
for 90 days if and when the FDA approves its use. The moratorium
is in the federal budget approved in August, in legislation authored
by first-term Senator <B>Russell Feingold</B> (D-WI) and was supported
by a group of 2l organizations, including the National Family
Farm Coalition, Community Nutrition Institute, Ben and Jerry's,
Inc., Consumers Union, and the National Farmers Union. The 12
member states of the European Commission were scheduled to vote
on the issue sometime in September. The recommendation to ban
bGH until the year 2000 was based on research conducted over the
past three years that reportedly shows smaller dairies would be
driven out of business. Additionally, the Commission's recommendation
pointed out that safety, quality, and efficacy standards could
only be met in controlled environments.   <BR>

<H3>Organic Foods Act Update </H3>

<P>
For the first time since the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA)
passed in 1990, funds have been appropriated for its implementation.
The U.S. House/Senate Budget Conference Committee accepted action
taken in early August in both the House and Senate to appropriate
$500,000 for implementation of OFPA, which had received no recommended
funding in the Administration's proposed budget. The National
Organic Standards Board will be funded, but USDA has not yet decided
the amount. Funding for the Board and for implementation of OFPA
had not been included in either the FY 1992 or FY 1993 final budgets.
As of October 1, 1993, it will be a violation of federal law to
sell or label a product as &quot;organic&quot; unless it meets
the requirements of the act, many of which are still unclear.
Regular updates on the progress of OFPA are included in <I>Nutrition
Week, </I>published by the Community Nutrition Institute, 2001
S. St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009.  <BR>

<H3> Decline in Farm Numbers and New Farmers Reported </H3>

<P>
The USDA's Economic Research Service Agricultural Outlook Summary
of June 1993 forecasts that farm numbers will likely decline by
an average of 15-20,000 per year in the coming decade. The trend
toward fewer, larger farms continues, though at a slower pace
than the 1950s and 1960s when the U.S. was losing over 100,000
farms annually. A recent study by the General Accounting Office
(GAO) notes that the number of individuals entering farming decreased
by 25 percent during the mid-1980s, a trend that is still continuing.
According to the report, high entry costs for land and equipment
are a chief impediment. The USDA is currently drafting regulations
to implement legislation that would target federal loans to beginning
farmers. Farm Finance: Number of New Farmers is Declining (GAO/RCED-93-95)
is available at no charge from the U.S. GAO, P.O. Box 6015, Gaithersburg,
MD 20884-6015.<BR>

<H1>Organic, Conventional Comparisons in Apples</H1>
<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels<BR>
</I>
<P>
Can organic apples be grown profitably in California?  Based on
two years of SAREP-funded research, the answer appears to be related
to two issues: climate, and the development of more effective
codling moth control.  If organic apples are grown where the climate
is favorable for codling moth or apple scab development and more
effective methods of codling moth control are not developed, the
organic crop is not profitable.  If the orchard is located where
there is little codling moth or apple scab, the crop is profitable.
 The research, conducted in three  apple  districts, was led by
<B>Sean Swezey</B>, entomologist with the Agroecology  Program
at UC Santa Cruz, <B>Janet Caprile</B>, Contra Costa farm advisor,
and <B>Paul Vossen</B>, Sonoma County farm advisor.  At each site,
organic apple production was compared to conventional production
in replicated experiments for two years.<BR>
<P>
Controlling codling moth (&quot;the worm in the apple&quot;) proved
to be the overriding obstacle to profitable organic apple production
in Sonoma and Contra Costa Counties.  The arsenal of materials
used to battle this pest included numerous sprays of Codling Moth
Granulosis Virus (CMGV), ryania, <I>Bacillus thuringiensis </I>(Bt),
Bt plus oil, and oil alone.  Still, codling moth damage in Contra
Costa County amounted to 30 percent in 1990 and 40 percent in
1991.  In Sonoma County, 18 percent and 34 percent of the fruit
(average of three varieties) were infested in 1990 and 1991, respectively;
in 1991, 56 percent of the Red Delicious apples were damaged.
In Watsonville (Santa Cruz County), however, there were no significant
differences in damage between the conventional and organic systems.
 Damage in the conventional plots of all sites was quite low.
 The cool coastal climate of this region offers a distinct advantage,
which usually allows  only  two flights of codling moth compared
to three or even four flights in other regions.<BR>
<P>
Yields and net returns in Sonoma and Contra Costa Counties were
inversely correlated to damage by codling moth.  Average yields
of the organic apples in Sonoma County were 30 and 64 percent
lower than conventional apples in 1990 and 1991, respectively.
 Production was also affected by untimely rains, which caused
apple scab damage.  Costs exceeded income for organic apples.
 In Contra Costa County, yields in the organic treatments were
about 20 percent lower than the conventional for 1990 and 1991;
packable fruit was reduced by 53 and 80 percent, respectively.
 The organic system had an increasingly negative net return each
year, while the conventional system had increasingly positive
net returns.  In Santa Cruz County, yields were significantly
higher in the organic system in two of the three years studied,
with correspondingly higher returns per acre. <BR>

<H1>Native Grass Restoration Helps Control Erosion, Weeds<BR>
</H1>
<P>
&quot;Vegetation and Wildlife Habitat Establishment&quot; was
the topic of an Esparto conference February 10 sponsored by the
Yolo, Dixon and Ulatis Resource Conservafion districts, the Soil
and Water Conservation Society, and the Yolo County Parks, Recreation
and Wildlife Advisory Committee. The workshop was attended by
180 farmers, researchers and students.<BR>
<P>
Native grasses and their ability to control soil erosion, eliminate
weeds and reduce herbicide use were discussed by <B>John Anderson</B>,
a Yolo County veterinarian and restoration ecologist who initiated
the annual vegetation workshops. A summary of Anderson's talk
and related work follows.
<H3>Grasses Dominant</H3>
<P>
Anderson discussed California's ecological history, noting that
perennial native grasses were the dominant vegetation before the
state was widely settled. The native grasses remained green throughout
the year and gave the landscape a soft, tufted  appearance. During
the spring, wildflowers would bloom in fields of needlegrass,
blue wildrye, mountain brome, meadow barley, creeping or beardless
wildrye, and creeping fescue.   These native grasses were widespread
and in many places formed native prairies, which were nearly wiped
out during the mid-1800s, by overgrazing and weedy annual grasses
from the Mediterranean area, he said.
<H3>Roadside Weeds</H3>
<P>
Anderson said roadside prairie restoration is a good solution
to the expensive battle against weeds and erosion throughout the
Sacramento Valley. He noted that Yolo County spends more than
$40,000 a year ($100 per mile) for roadside weed control, including
herbicides and plowing. Anderson described trial roadside plantings
of native grasses in Yolo County north of Winters, studies which
are continuing in 1990.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We use some selective herbicides to keep the weeds down
while we're getting the native grasses established. But after
a couple of years, we can do away with herbicides, and manage
by mowing. And these native grasses won't invade the farmers'
fields like the noxious weeds you see along most roadsides,&quot;
he said.
<H3>Orchard Use</H3>
<P>
In followup discussions, Anderson said it may be p05sible to use
native grasses in orchards, too. Most native grasses don't grow
during the summer, so they wouldn't compete with trees for water
during the period when moisture stress is the greatest, he said.
He noted that native grasses should improve soil structure and
add soil organic matter.<BR>
<P>
Anderson described native grasses now available, and specific
techniques for their establishment in roadsides and on ditchbanks.
He became interested in prairie restoration in 1979, when he learned
to recognize native grasses.  He searched Yolo County hills and
creek banks for remnant stands of the old prairie, collected seeds,
grew plants in a greenhouse, and established seed-producing stands
on his own farm. He has had extensive contacts with ConservaSeed
of Walnut Grove, the state's largest grower of native grass materials.
ConservaSeed researchers are now growing offspring of some of
the native grasses Anderson discovered. Researchers  in  the agronomy
and range science department at UC Davis are also working with
Anderson on the use of native grasses on rangelands.
<H3>Other Views</H3>
<P>
Other speakers at the vegetation and habitat establishment workshop
included <B>John Tiedeman</B>, an agricultural engineer with the
Soil Conservation Service, who spoke about water habitat management;
<B>Robert Bugg</B>, UC SAREP cover crops specialist, who discussed
perennial and annual insectary plants to provide habitat for beneficial
insects; and <B>Steve Chainey</B>, a vegetation ecologist for
Jones and Stokes Associates of Sacramento, who discussed different
California plant communities worthy of restoration.<BR>
<P>
Also speaking were <B>Ann Fisher</B>, owner/operator of Cornflower
Farms of Elk Grove, native plant specialists, who discussed propagating
native woody plants; <B>Bob Smith</B>, California Department of
Fish and Game wildlife biologist, who talked about restoring waterfowl
habitat; <B>David Amme</B>, director of research at ConservaSeed,
who discussed specific native grasses; and <B>Charlie Rominger</B>,
Yolo County farmer, who discussed practical aspects of developing
small-scale wetlands on farms. <B>Rocky Thompson</B>,  a perennial
native vegetation specialist for Circuit Rider Productions Inc.
of Windsor, a native plant nursery, gave a practical demonstration
on the establishment of native woody perennials.

Grants &amp; Society<BR>

<P>
Institutions across the country are changing because of demands
being made by society. Land grant institutions have traditionally
been very important to agriculture. They were created by legislation
during the administration of Abraham Lincoln, a time of great
change. These universities were brought into being to help an
agrarian society deal with the day's contemporary problems. Today,
many question whether land grant universities have a role in modern
society. They question the relevance of what we do. They ask whether
we work for society in general, or is the mission agricultural
production only? Do we have a role in the stewardship of the state's
natural and human resources? These are complex questions, particularly
with financial resources declining in California and across the
country. <B>John Kinsella</B>, dean of UC Davis' College of Agricultural
and Environmental Sciences, said in a February newsletter that
the land grant &quot;model must now be adapted and directed to
a broader range of activities (e.g., social issues, sustainable
systems), in addition to agricultural production.&quot; I agree
with Kinsella and believe that dialogue with people outside the
land grant system is essential if we are to survive. Two very
different pieces I read recently also make this point. One was
an editorial in the mid-January issue of <I>California Farmer
</I>by editor <B>Len Richardson</B>, an astute observer of California
agriculture and the UC system. He said the university and the
Regents must demonstrate that:
<UL>
<LI>the Land Grant vision of extension and public service is vital
and relevant in today's urban society;
<LI>the public service mission is supported as a prioritized goal
in budgets and commitments
<LI>at the highest levels of the university-i.e., the president
and regents;
<LI>this commitment to the next generation of Californians puts
research to work for inner-cities, communities and families through
the transfer of knowledge. This includes financial support for
research to guide the development of youth programs needed in
a fast-changing society.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Finally, Richardson said, &quot;we doubt that needed research
or academic quality can be maintained in today's leaner environment
unless something is done at all levels of education to eliminate
the tenure system. At UC, the Academic Senate has a choke-hold
that is strangling not only the university, but the future of
California. If the Regents and legislature can't act, it is time
for a ballot initiative.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The second article was the text of a speech presented to the Board
of Agriculture of the National Academy of Sciences last year by
<B>Karl Stauber</B>, vice president of the Northwest Area Foundation
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The text appeared in the Minnesota Food
Association's newsletter last October. The Northwest Area Foundation
has given $6 million in recent years to land grant institutions
focusing on agriculture, natural resources and rural poverty issues.
Stauber asked all those who work within the land grant system:
Will land grant universities survive? In the debate about the
mission of land grant universities he says we should be prepared
to answer the following questions about our work:
<UL>
<LI>Is the land grant university still an engine of positive social
change? How do you prove it?
<LI>Is there a size bias, sector bias, or capital intensity bias
in your work? Is that bias
<LI>socially responsible?
<LI>Will your work lead someone to be disadvantaged? How do you
decide who &quot;should&quot; be disadvantaged? Why should society
let you make that decision? Why should society pay for this?
<LI>Some would argue that increased yield without regard to externalities
has been the driving strategic vision of the land grant university
since at least the 1950s. Is this the case? If so, how is it justified?
<LI>Why are professional societies given such an important role,
directly and indirectly, in determining career advancement within
the land grant system? How does one defend the weight given to
the opinion of a peer scientist from another part of the country
over that of a tax-paying resident and consumer in the state of
origin?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
If we in the land grant institutions are to survive and succeed,
Stauber suggested we must do the following: &quot;be inclusive
rather than exclusive. Become the place where diverse points of
view come together. Develop new mechanisms for multidisciplinary,
user-focused research.&quot; He said we must be aware that almost
all decisions are tradeoffs, and that the land grant university
can help society understand this. Stauber concluded by noting
that for the past 30 years, many of us have made our professional
careers on quantification. &quot;If maximization of production
is not going to be society's major objective for the land grant
institution,&quot; Stauber said, people within the land grant
universities can help fellow researchers address &quot;critical,
nonquantifiable issues where good science may not be able to predict
the outcome, but can assist in the development of reasonable alternatives.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
These messages have a clear meaning. The public needs to be included
in discussions of both natural and human resource issues and in
setting the research and education agenda. We at the land grant
institutions can be the positive change agents for this new agenda.
We must see these changes for what they are: opportunities. Our
very survival depends on this<I>.-<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, director UC

<H1>Citrus Herbicides &amp; Groundwater Quality</H1>
<P>
<I>By Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(Editor's Note: This is the first part of a two-part series
on citrus production and groundwater contamination.  Part 2 will
appear in Sustainable Agriculture News Vol.4, No.3, Spring 1992.
Information from this series will be included in a SAREP citrus
publication due out at the end of 1992.)<BR>
</I>
<P>
The issue of groundwater contamination will face California citrus
growers even after the effects of the freeze and drought have
subsided.  Citrus production is not the sole source of pollution.
However, increasing numbers of wells in concentrated citrus districts
are contaminated with herbicides used on citrus groves-simazine,
diuron and bromacil.  Nitrate contamination is a concern for growers
of all crops, yet fertilization techniques have been developed
for citrus that can greatly minimize the pollution potential.
<BR>
<P>
UC SAREP organized a meeting among selected growers, farm advisors,
and consultants in September 1991 to explore methods of preventing
groundwater pollution.  While numerous solutions were proposed,
nearly all techniques discussed have tradeoffs which may hinder
their adoption. The following discussion on solutions to groundwater
contamination by herbicides is derived from the meeting, individual
contacts, and literature on the subject.<BR>
<P>
Complete nontillage management is practiced in more than 90 percent
of California's citrus groves, with unwanted vegetation largely
controlled by preemergence (residual) herbicides (Pehrson, 1988).
 Nontillage is used because cultivation can damage the shallow
tree roots and increase soil compaction, while floor vegetation
can predispose citrus to frost damage and can compete with trees
 for water and nutrients.  The use of residual herbicides has
been economical, simple, and for the most part, effective.  For
more than three decades, there has been no strong motivation for
the majority of growers to use any other technique.<BR>
<P>
The discovery of herbicides in groundwater (even small quantities)
is but one indication that current production practices are not
sustainable.  Sustainability implies that, among other things,
materials and practices used on the farm do not harm the surrounding
environment.  Environmental and social pressures brought about
by groundwater contamination will eventually override the economics
of complete herbicide management.<BR>
<H3>Weed Control Alternatives</H3>
<P>
Few truly &quot;sustainable&quot; techniques have been developed
as viable alternatives to current floor management practices.
 Currently there are four methods of preventing or reducing groundwater
contamination by herbicides:  1) management of weeds or cover
crops through mowing, tillage, or minimum tillage, 2) improved
irrigation management, 3) modified use of herbicides, and/or 4)
prevention of direct streaming from the surface.<BR>
<P>
<B>Vegetation management:  Cover crops</B>.  One obvious way to
prevent herbicides from leaching is not to use them.  Simply mowing
the weeds, however, may result in a competitive perennial grass
sod cover.  And repeated tillage kills tree roots and reduces
water infiltration.  Planting selected species of ground cover,
however, can help suppress weeds. In addition, cover cropping
can add or conserve nitrogen, provide food for beneficial insects,
improve water infiltration, and add organic matter.  There are
numerous obstacles to growing cover crops successfully, including
frost concerns, tillage, water use, and shading.  Several management
strategies exist to alleviate many of these concerns (see UC SAREP's
<I>Components Vol. 2, number 3).<BR>
</I>
<P>
At the September 1991 meeting cover crop establishment was discussed
by <B>John Freeman</B>, previous foreman of the organic orchards
at Paramount Citrus.  He recommended that growers first consider
the soil type and depth; cover crops are easier to manage on sandier
soils.  Growers must also be prepared for problems that maybe
associated with cultivation (if used), such as compaction and
dust.  Also, a substantial cover crop or implements may not fit
between closely planted rows (22 feet).  Rows should be oriented
north-south to enhance sunlight penetration. Consider the method
of irrigation:  Furrow is the easiest system for managing cover
crops; dragline sprinklers may be the next best.  Freeman also
noted that herbicide residues in the soil can be a serious problem
in the first year or two of cover cropping.  The toxicity can
be at least partially overcome by adding bulky organic amendments
and using a large-seeded mix.  Grasses are the most tolerant to
herbicide residues, although an annual grass/vetch mix would probably
be appropriate.<BR>
<P>
Some growers are using the following reduced-tillage cover crop
management strategy.  First, the soil is lightly tilled in early
fall.  Seeds of winter annual legumes and/or grasses are then
drilled in the aisles.  One or more irrigations follow to germinate
the seeds (low volume sprinklers can be moved into the aisles
temporarily).  The cover crop is mowed periodically during the
frost season.  Allowing the cover crop to grow during late spring
can suppress weed growth.  A final mowing in late spring provides
a mulch that can conserve soil moisture.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Irrigation</B>.  Applying water for frost protection is effective
and relatively inexpensive, so it is unlikely that this practice
will be modified substantially.  However, limiting irrigation
depth during the growing season and using under-tree irrigation
will reduce leaching and save water.<BR>
<P>
<I>Depth of wetting.  </I>Short and frequent irrigations limit
water to the depth of the root zone and help prevent pesticides
from moving downward into the groundwater.  Limiting the depth
of the wetting also keeps herbicides in the upper soil levels
where organic matter breaks them down.  It is to the grower's
advantage to precisely manage irrigations in this manner, as short
and frequent irrigations reduce tree stress and save water and
money.  (For information on scheduling irrigations, see Pehrson,
1985.)<I>  </I>In many areas of Southern California, saline irrigation
water can lead to a buildup of salts in the soil.  Excess water
(known as leaching fraction) must be applied to move these salts
below the root zone.<BR>
<P>
<I>Under-tree irrigation </I>involves placing one (360 degree)
or two (180 degree) low-volume emitters near the tree trunk so
that irrigation water is being supplied under the canopy only.
 This technique is gaining in popularity and has many benefits.
 Excellent summer weed control may be possible without residual
herbicides, since all sunlit areas remain dry (weeds thrive only
where the sun shines on watered soil).  Well-timed spot treatments
with a contact herbicide could be used to control weed escapes
brought up by spring rains.  Other advantages to under-tree irrigation
include reduced water use, movement of salts away from the root
zone, enhanced frost protection, and less damage to the emitters
by workers and equipment.  Tree &quot;skirts&quot; should be pruned
up off the ground to use this method effectively.  &quot;Skirting&quot;
can also aid in the control of Fuller rose beetle, snails, and
brown rot; it also makes it easier to inspect emitters.<BR>
<P>
There are some potential problems associated with under-tree placement.
 With frequent wetting of the trunk and crown of the tree, some
people believe that the incidence of root diseases may increase.
 While many growers have not found this to be the case, using
two 180 degree emitters will eliminate this potential problem
by keeping the crown area dry.  However, using two emitters increases
costs and may increase clogging.  Also, it becomes difficult to
use cover crops, compost or manures effectively without wetting
the aisles.  Researchers in Southern California are testing the
application of manure under the trees, where leaching would move
nutrients down.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Prevention of direct streaming</B>.  It is likely that both
leaching through the soil and direct &quot;pipelines&quot; transport
herbicides into the groundwater.  Simple preventive measures should
be used to prevent direct streaming, including 1) mixing and storing
pesticides and moving tank-loading facilities away from wells,
2) installing anti-siphon valves where spray tanks are filled
(required by law), 3) sealing cracked wellheads, 4) capping and
berming abandoned wells, and 5) constructing berms around irrigation
wells and &quot;dry wells&quot; (drainage sumps installed in many
orchards up until the 1970s).<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Modified herbicide use</B>.  Considering the increasing pressures
to severely reduce or eliminate pesticide use, simply modifying
herbicide use may not be viable in the long run.  Yet for the
vast majority of growers who currently rely on nontillage with
residual herbicides, several alternative practices show promise
in reducing herbicide leaching.<BR>
<P>
<I>Spring applications.  </I>A 1988 survey showed a strong correlation
between the use of irrigation for frost protection and the frequency
of well water contamination in Tulare County (Pickett et. al.,
1990).  Fall-applied residual herbicides probably move through
the soil with the large quantities of winter-applied water.  Therefore
replacing the fall herbicide application with a spring treatment
is a partial solution.  Spring applications would also enhance
control of summer weeds, especially marestail and fleabane.  The
primary tradeoffs are that rainfall, which is required to activate
or fix the herbicide, is far less dependable in the spring than
in the fall; winter weeds are not adequately controlled and require
a &quot;burndown&quot; contact application in the spring; the
orchard floor may be too wet for spring equipment use, and spring
treatments may be phytotoxic to the trees.<BR>
<P>
<I>Split application, </I>applying half of a leachable herbicide
in the fall and half in the spring, is an approach used by many
growers.  It also offers the possibility of using different materials
for cool- and warm-season weeds.  Less herbicide may be needed
if only the irrigated areas are treated in the spring.  If top
rates are used in both treatments, however, more total herbicide
might be used than with a single application.<BR>
<P>
<I>Contact sprays.  </I>If only preemergence herbicides are being
found in wells, why not simply use contact sprays?  This approach
is attracting increasing interest, but it also has problems. 
For example, spray timing is critical, and wet soils may hinder
access during optimum times.  Also, contact sprays require a minimum
of four applications per year, which may be more expensive and
cause more soil compaction than using other herbicides.  Some
growers have observed that eliminating residual sprays has led
to increased earthworm activity, a desirable side effect for soil
tilth and fertility.<BR>
<P>
<I>Alternative preemergence herbicides </I>are available, but
probably do not offer a long-term solution because they, too,
may find their way into groundwater.  Those currently available
are also more expensive and more selective than the herbicides
they are meant to replace.<BR>
<P>
Growers of all crops are being challenged to produce safe, inexpensive
food without damaging the soil, the air, or the water.  They must
also maintain their economic stability.  In the long term, however,
economic stability is dependent on environmental and social well-being.
 Citrus growers are confronted with numerous obstacles to sustainability.
 Some alternative weed management practices have already been
developed to minimize environmental impacts, and much more needs
to be done.  (References will be listed at the end of Part 2,

Thirty-four research and education projects have been granted
a total of $149,681 by UC SAREP in its 1994/95 funding cycle,
according to <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, </B>SAREP director.  New projects
were chosen in four different areas: economics and public policy,
production, meetings, and graduate student awards.  A brief description
of the projects, principal investigators and amounts awarded for
the first year follows.
<A NAME="economics"></A><H3>Economics and Public Policy Projects</H3>

<H3>(5 projects; $51,298)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Robert Gottlieb, </B>Urban Planning, UCLA, &quot;Expanding
Direct Marketing Opportunities for Community Food Security and
to Reduce Pesticide Use&quot;: $10,615.  This project will develop
and evaluate new marketing arrangements that link farmers selling
at farmers' markets with poor and low-income urban consumers.
 A pilot project will focus on the Gardena farmers' market, located
in a mixed low- and middle-income neighborhood in southwest Los
Angeles. 
<P><LI><B>Sharon K. Junge, Roger Ingram, </B>and <B>Garth Veerkamp,
</B>Placer County Cooperative Extension Office, &quot;Reason for
the Season: Increasing Sustainable Practices Among Consumers&quot;:
$12,000.  This project will create a regional food guide to educate
consumers on the benefits of purchasing locally produced, processed
and distributed food that is geared to seasonal availability.
 Baseline data will be collected on food production, distribution
and consumption in Placer County in order to evaluate the food
system's impact on nutrition, environment, energy consumption,
and local economic development.
<P><LI><B>Jered Lawson, </B>in cooperation with the Community Alliance
with Family Farmers, &quot;Sharing the Costs of Land Tenure and
Stewardship: A Profile of a Family and Community's Efforts to
Preserve their Agricultural Land and their Sustainable Farming
Practices&quot;: $5,000.  The project will create a manual describing
&quot;shared equity,&quot; an innovative model for maintaining
ag land in sustainable production.  In the model developed by
<B>Steve </B>and <B>Gloria Decater </B>at Live Power Community
Farm in Covelo, the farmer owns the productive agricultural value
of the land, and a non-profit organization owns the land's additional
speculative or market value.
<P><LI><B>Peter Lehman, </B>Humboldt State University, &quot;Arcata
Farm and Education Project&quot;: $8,683.  This continuing project
is a student-operated, community supported farm designed to serve
as a sustainable agriculture education facility for students of
all ages, local farmers, and community members.  The farm serves
as a teaching facility for Humboldt State classes, as a community
supported agriculture site, and its staff engages in extensive
outreach to the local area. 
<P><LI><B>Don Villarejo, </B>California Institute for Rural Studies,
&quot;Viability of Small and Medium Scale Farms in California:
Case Study of Fresno and Monterey Counties&quot;: $ 15,000.  This
project will determine current farm turnover-both farmers going
out of business and farmers entering business-in Monterey and
Fresno counties, two key agricultural areas.  The impacts of farm
size, commodities, and ethnicity on farm survival will be assessed.
</UL>

<A NAME="production"></A><H3>Production Projects (9 projects; $7S,986)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Karen Klonsky, </B>Agricultural Economics, UC Davis, &quot;BIOS
Economic Impact Study: Quantifying the Transition to Sustainable
Production&quot;: $9,194.  The impacts on income and expenses
will be determined for farms enrolled in the Merced County almond
Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program.  This
project will also evaluate the economic viability of the BIOS
production method over a three-year transition period.
<P><LI><B>Bruce Jaffee, </B>Nematology, UC Davis, &quot;Suppression
of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes in Conventional and Organic Farming
Systems&quot;: $5,155.  Soils from conventional and organic farming
systems will be examined for their ability to suppress plant-parasitic
nematodes.  The project will be conducted at the Sustainable Agriculture
Farming Systems Project at UC Davis.
<P><LI><B>Steven Koike, </B>Monterey County farm advisor, &quot;Determination
of the Effect of Cover Crops on Lettuce Drop Disease: Year Two&quot;:
$3,640.  This is the third year of a study that will identify
cover or rotation crops that reduce lettuce drop disease.  Additionally,
the study will determine the effect of manure and yard waste compost
on populations of the lettuce drop pathogen.
<P><LI><B>Steve Temple, </B>Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;A Comparison of Conventional, Low Input and Organic Farming
Systems: The Transition Phase and Long Term Viability&quot;: $12,253.
 <A HREF="http://pubweb.ucdavis.edu/documents/safs/home.htm">The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems Project</A> at UC Davis
is in its seventh year.  It is comparing four farming systems
with different levels of dependence on external resources over
a 12-year period.
<P><LI><B>Richard Smith, </B>San Benito County farm advisor, &quot;Nitrogen
Fertility Monitoring in Organic and Conventional Vegetable Systems&quot;:
$2,744.  In organic farming systems, &quot;quick tests&quot; for
nitrate in plant and soil analyses may not be a good indicator
of crop nitrogen status.  This study will evaluate quick tests
on two organic and two conventional onion farms.
<P><LI><B>Krishna Subbarao, </B>assistant plant pathologist, Cooperative
Extension Specialist, UC Davis, &quot;Subsurface Drip Irrigation
for Soilbome Disease Management in Lettuce&quot;: $11,000.  The
use of subsurface drip irrigation in vegetable production can
improve the efficiency of water use and reduce nitrate leaching.
 This project will evaluate the effects of subsurface drip and
furrow irrigations on lettuce diseases.
<P><LI><B>Ford Denison, </B>Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;Rotation Length and Organic Transitions&quot;:  $10,000.
 An additional four-year organic rotation will be added to the
SAREP funded 100-year long-term farmland research experiment at
UC Davis.  The project will evaluate two-year and four-year rotation
length and will assess the contributions of soil quality and human
factors in the transition to organic farming.

the Environment</H1>
<P>
The friction among agricultural, urban and environmental perspectives
continues to be a major issue in California.  It is a critical
factor when the future of the Central Valley is considered.  The
area that stretches from Bakersfield to Redding is expected to
double in population within 25<I> </I>years.<BR>
<P>
Think about that if you live or work in the Valley.  Twice as
many people, and probably twice as many cars and air pollution.
 How will it affect the Valley's resource base?  What will the
quality of life be like for residents of the area and how healthy
will they be?<BR>
<P>
Let's look at just one factor - air quality.  How do we solve
the problem of air pollution?  Ozone, a major air pollutant, is
now responsible for a 10 to 25<I> </I>percent reduction in crop
yields.  If an insect pest were responsible for a problem that
large, the University would be besieged by desperate farmers.
 If the ozone levels double in 25 years, what happens to the crops?
 What happens to the people?  What happens to the Sierra forests
where ozone levels today are sometimes three times the levels
of the Valley floor?<BR>
<P>
The Sierra is our major watershed.  Will the pollution destroy
the trees and the watershed?  Can we prevent that from happening?
 Maybe.  Will we do our best to make sure this doesn't happen?
 That is not clear-because to assure the health of the Sierra
and the health of Valley crops and residents, people will have
to change.  If auto transportation is the culprit, we must change
our fuels and develop efficient and useful mass transit or come
up with other solutions.<BR>
<P>
In the meantime, we have large numbers of unemployed Californians
who staffed the defense industry for the last thirty years.  If
we shift our thinking and resources to use these hardworking individuals
to solve pressing problems like air pollution, we could solve
many of our regional unemployment and resource problems while
protecting the state's future.  Will we do it?  Only time will
tell. -<I>Bill Liebhardt, director, UC Sustainable Agriculture
Research &amp; Education Program.<BR>

<H1>Pesticide Use Reduction:  an Emerging Trend in State Policy
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Monica Moore, Pesticide Action Network North America Regional
Center<BR>
</I>
<P>
In 1992, the Pesticide Action Network North America Regional Center
(PANNA) began considering how its study of national pesticide
use reduction (PUR) plans in several European countries could
contribute to the ongoing transition to more sustainable agricultural
practices in California.  At the time, pesticide use reduction
as an explicit policy goal was not widely discussed in the state.
 PANNA recognized that the historic lack of an overall state pest
management policy and consistent regulatory framework created
obstacles to investments in new, more ecologically and economically
sound farm technologies and enterprises.  Experiences in a number
of European countries suggested that a comprehensive pesticide
use reduction plan would help address many of these uncertainties.
 This article summarizes the activities of PANNA's California
Pesticide Use Reduction Project to date.
<H3>State Pesticide Use Reduction Plan</H3>

<P>
In 1993, with a grant from the University of California Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Program (UC SAREP), PANNA undertook
a consultative process to develop an outline for a preliminary
pesticide use reduction plan for the state of California.  To
begin the project, investigators identified persons knowledgeable
about aspects of pesticide use reduction potential in California.
 Forty-six project cooperators agreed to participate in a process
to assess the utility and optimal design of a state PUR plan.
 Cooperators were selected to provide input from sectors likely
to be affected by the adoption of pesticide use reduction policies,
including farmers (organic, transitional and conventional growers),
farmworkers and farmworker advocates, regulatory and other government
agency officials, health workers, pest control advisors, pest
control operators, extension workers, and citizen group representatives.
<BR>

<P>
A summary of the European PUR plans was produced and circulated
to cooperators, who were asked to provide written feedback on
the appropriateness of specific policy tools in a California context;
relevant policies they noted as absent from European plans; and
PUR-related policies that were already in place in California.
 These comments were gathered into a questionnaire format and
distributed to cooperators to obtain more specific commentary
on policy proposals of fellow cooperators and adapted from various
European plans.<BR>

<P>
A draft pesticide use reduction program for the state of California
was developed directly from cooperator responses to the questionnaire.
 Policies receiving a plurality or a majority of positive responses
were included in the draft plan.  This draft plan was sent to
cooperators, with a complete compilation of responses to the questionnaire.
 Next, a series of cooperator meetings in Sacramento, Merced,
and San Francisco were convened to discuss and solicit in-person
comments on the draft plan.  The meetings were structured to allow
the groups to focus on what cooperators identified as the most
problematic aspects of the draft plan, as well as policies considered
most promising for achieving real reductions in pesticide use
in California.  Resulting discussions identified a number of components
that seemed fundamental to a successful state pesticide use reduction
policy.  PANNA also found that most project cooperators were in
agreement on the feasibility of introducing the following policies
in the California context.<BR>

<H3>Key Policy Components</H3>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Establish a numerical use reduction goal that
is voluntary and ambitious.  PANNA proposes a target of at least
a 50% reduction of pesticide use in the state by the year 2000,
with 1992 set as the base year against which to   measure reduction.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Establish specific reduction strategies by sector.
 This process must include the participation of affected communities
and interested parties, including farmers, environmentalists,
farmworkers, consumer organizations, structural pest control operators,
health workers, pest control advisors and extension workers</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Phase out high-hazard pesticides according to
specific criteria based on impacts to human health and the environment.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Increase funding for alternative agriculture
research and extension, specifically through competitive grants
programs.  Priority should be placed on farmer-identified research
problems, and emphasize on-farm, systems research.  The role of
the extension service should be clearly defined to emphasize the
provision of technical assistance regarding alternative production
methods.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Develop a program of financial incentives for
growers in transition to alternative agricultural practices. 
</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=1>Develop a pesticide fee-based mechanism for funding
both research and extension on alternatives and financial incentive
programs.  An additional fee should be levied on high-hazard pesticides
to discourage use and encourage phase-out.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These and other project findings were written up and circulated
to cooperators, as well as a broader list of policy makers, agricultural
and farmers organizations, extension agents, regulatory officials
and non-profit organizations.<BR>

<H3>Financial Incentives and Funding Mechanisms</H3>

<P>
In 1994, UC SAREP provided additional funding for follow-up research,
development and discussion of specific policy options in two PUR
related areas: financial incentives that encourage transition
to alternative pest management practices, and funding mechanisms
for the implementation of a state pesticide use reduction strategy.
 A draft document is now being finalized that examines the potential
of a variety of financial incentives to promote adoption of alternative
pest management, and how specific incentives might be structured
with respect to three crop production systems (cotton, strawberries,
and oranges).  Crop budget data and direct interviews with farmers,
farm advisors and independent pest control advisors were used
to identify and develop the incentives studied.  The document
also examines possible fee and tax structures as a means to recover
basic pesticide regulatory costs, social and environmental damages
of pesticide use, farm-based transition needs, and expanded research
and extension services promoting alternatives to pesticides.<BR>

<P>
The incentives and funding mechanisms discussion paper will be
sent to an expanded list of cooperators for written comment. 
From these responses, a set of policy recommendations will be
developed and recirculated.  Meetings with project cooperators
are scheduled in September (in the Southern San Joaquin Valley)
and November (in the Northern San Joaquin Valley).  Following
an analysis of written feedback and responses obtained from these
consultations, a set of policy recommendations will be prepared,
with a record of cooperator concerns not resolved by the final
recommendations.  Finally, the revised set of policy options and
discussion paper will be published and circulated among the group
participants, policy makers and other interested people.<BR>

<H1>Year-Round Farm Employment Publication </H1>

<P>
<B>     A new publication from UC SAREP shows farmers how to diversify
their operations to keep employees busy throughout the year</B>.
 <I>How to stabilize your work force (and Increase Profits, Productivity,
and Personal Satisfaction)</I> brings together the strategies,
benefits and challenges encountered by farmers who keep workers
employed year-round.  Funded by SAREP and authored by two agricultural
economists, a UC Cooperative Extension director, and two farm
advisors, the 44-page handbook includes information gleaned from
extensive interviews with 35 California farmers.
<P>
     The authors tried to identify the underlying principles that
make some farmers' systems work.  Activities used most often include
crop diversification and rotation, staggered planting, labor sharing
with other farmers, selective mechanization, saving work for the
off-season and value-added activities like wreath or jam-making.
 &quot;These farmers do this both to level out the peaks and valleys
of seasonal employment and to increase profitability,&quot; said
<B>Gary Johnston, </B>director of UC Cooperative Extension in
San Joaquin County.
<P>
     Johnston's co-authors include <B>Suzanne Vaupel</B> and <B>Melissa
Cadet</B>, Sacramento agricultural economist; <B>Franz Kegel</B>,
farm advisor emeritus, San Joaquin County; and <B>Gregory Billikopf</B>,
area farm advisor for Merced. 
<P>
     &quot;No easy formula for year-round cropping systems can
be given, due to different climatic regions, soils, markets, costs,
risks and local conditions,&quot; Vaupel said.
<P>
     She noted, however, that one of the benefits of  the benefits
of successful systems is generally lower unemployment insurance
and worker compensation rates.  &quot;A steady work force is more
likely to be familiar with the farm operation and equipment and
therefore is less likely to be injured,&quot; she said.  Although
this theory is not always true, the three farmers interviewed
most extensively had workers' compensation rates well below 100
(the average for the industry), and two of the rates were in the
50s, meaning that they are paying half the usual rate for the
particular agricultural activity.
<P>
     The handbook is available from UC  SAREP, University of California,
Davis, CA 95616; (916) 752-7556.  The cost is $6, with checks
or money orders payable to &quot;UC Regents.&quot;

<P>
This article provides the following estimates regarding alfalfa's
contribution to the cycling of nitrogen in agricultural systems.
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Alfalfa forage is about 17.5 percent crude protein, 2.8 percent
nitrogen.
<LI>Roughly 50 percent of the nitrogen in the herbage is derived
from N2 fixation in the seeding year and 80 percent is derived
from fixation in succeeding years.
<LI>Published estimates of annual N2 fixation by alfalfa range
from 70 kilograms per hectare (63 lb/acre) for seedling stands
to 400 kilograms per hectare (356 lb/ acre) in mature stands.
<LI>Alfalfa roots have the capacity to absorb water and nutrients
at depths of 11 meters. This characteristic makes alfalfa an efficient
interceptor of residual soil nitrogen.
<LI>The total nitrogen content of soil increases during alfalfa
growth, possibly through excretion of symbiotically fixed nitrogen,
or sloughing off of old root cells. Recent estimates agree that
about 56 kilograms per hectare (50 lb/acre) are added per year.
<LI>There is little nitrate leaching loss from a stand of developing
alfalfa. However, nitrate leaching losses following destruction
of an alfalfa stand can be significant under certain soil, climatic,
and irrigated conditions.
</OL>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></B>
<H3><B>Discussion</B></H3>

<P>
Alfalfa acts as a buffer in the nitrogen cycle by adjusting the
amount of nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere to complement soil
nitrogen available from other sources. Alfalfa may also be able
to intercept and remove nitrate-nitrogen from great depths in
the soil and prevent it from being leached into groundwater. Because
of its high nitrogen content, care must be exercised when rotating
a stand of alfalfa to other crops.<BR>

<P>
The authors recommend practices that prevent excessive or poorly-timed
nitrogen mineralization and minimize potential leaching of nitrogen
during noncropped periods. For example, the common practice of
fall tilling alfalfa stands when rotating to a nonlegume should
probably be discouraged; instead, growers should plowdown early
spring regrowth. For a 3-year old alfalfa stand, this could contribute
380 kilograms nitrogen per hectare (339 lb/acre) to the available
soil nitrogen pool over the next five years. In addition to minimizing
nitrate-nitrogen leaching losses, this practice would permit alfalfa
to use water in the fall and early spring, water that might otherwise
be available for leaching.<BR>

<P>
In summary: &quot;Producers and policymakers should be aware of
the potentially negative effects of alfalfa and of ways to minimize
chances for groundwater contamination when rotating to another
crop. Most important, it is crucial that producers recognize the
nitrogen supplied by legumes and manure, and reduce fertilizer
nitrogen application rates for succeeding crops accordingly.&quot;

<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass averages about 217,000 seeds/lb.  (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Common annual or Italian ryegrass has awns whereas 'Wimmera-62' is awnless (Slayback, pers. comm.; Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Seedling vigor is good (USDA-SCS, 1973), and the grass is very competitive (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Annual ryegrass has faster seedling establishment and greater seedling vigor than does perennial ryegrass (Miller, 1984). 'Wimmera 62' also shows strong seedling vigor (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Annual or Italian ryegrass is naturalized throughout much of California, mostly at lower elevations (Crampton, 1974).  In general it is suitable for elevations below 3,000 ft.  (Slayback, pers. comm.) and is best adapted in coastal areas with long seasons of cool, moist weather and in excess of 12 inches rainfall (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P> <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> and <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> are tolerant of a wide range of soils and climates.  They will tolerate temporary floods, and do better than small grains on wet soils, but perform best on well-drained soils (Miller, 1984).<P> <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> and <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> will grow on sandy soils if they are well fertilized, but do better on heavier clay or silty soils with adequate drainage.  (Miller, 1984). Annual ryegrass can be used as a green manure crop in rotations. (Miller, 1984).  'Wimmera 62' is well adapted below 3,000 feet (Finch and Sharp, 1983.)<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Common annual ryegrass flowers from June through August (Munz, 1973) and matures seed by mid June (Finch and Sharp, 1983). 'Wimmera 62' matures in late May (Finch and Sharp, 1983.), about 2 weeks earlier than common ryegrass (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Some agricultural workers may be allergic to the wind-blown pollen of annual ryegrass (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed is generally plentiful for both annual and perennial ryegrasses (Finch & Sharp, 1983; Miller, 1984; Miller et al., 1989).  Certified seed of cvv 'Astor' and 'Wimmera 62' became available on the West Coast during the '70's (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P> Because <I>L.  multiflorum</I></B> cross-pollinates readily with other <I>Lolium</I></B> species, seed sold as annual ryegrass may be contaminated. Relatively-pure seed may be procured from certified variety named lots (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Sources are listed in: Southern Seedsmen's Association, 1989 Directory and Buyers' Guide (40th Ed).  SSA, Alexandria, Louisiana, 268 pp. (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>'Astor' was selected for high forage yield and quality in coastal areas of Oregon and Washington (USDA-SCS, 1973).  In general, only spring types of annual ryegrass should be used in California (Miller et al.  1989).  'Wimmera 62' was selected for use in areas of relatively low humidity and rainfall in California (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Grows to about 4 feet height in the most favorable environments (USDA-SCS, 1973), whereas Miller (1984) indicated height of about 130 cm (52 in). Measurements by Bugg et al. (unpublished data) in a replicated study (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991, showed that height for annual ryegrass (cv 'Oregon Common') was 92.08+/-4.20 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Plants are yellowish-green at the base.  Glossy leaves attain up to 12-inch length.  Awned multiple florets are carried close to and alternating along a zig-zag rachis up to one foot long (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Both annual and perennial ryegrasses are bunch grasses (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>1,484 kg/ha was the average yield in the U.S.A.  during 1981 (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  Heavy seed yields are obtained on favorable sites with high soil fertility (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>This grass tolerates acidic to moderately alkaline soils (USDA-SCS, 1973); the pH range is 5-8, with the optimum between 6 and 7 (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seeding procedure is to loosen surface soil, followed by smoothing and firming.  Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be seeded into bermuda grass sod (Miller, 1984).  On highly-erodible slopes, 3,000 to 4,000 lbs per acre of straw can be applied as a surface mulch following seeding and fertilizing to hold soil and seed in place until a stand is established. Annual ryegrass is much used to "hydroseed" steep critical areas using mixtures of seed, fertilizer and commercial wood fiber mulch in water (USDA-SCS, 1973).  This procedure is becoming less popular in light of the tendency of annual ryegrass to compete with native grasses (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> 'Wimmera 62' should be seeded on a prepared seedbed, and seed should then be covered (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> In New York state, several cover crops were evaluated after overseeding into corn 6-18" high: ryegrass and medium red clover + ryegrass have performed well (Scott and Burt, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass can persist almost indefinitely in pastures, orchards, vineyards, wildlife areas and critical areas if permitted to set and drop seed.  When used for temporary cover, annual ryegrass should be kept from setting seed by plowing under, disking, or mowing during early bloom (USDA-SCS, 1973). Annual ryegrass shows excellent performance and reestablishment in mature pecan orchards of southern Georgia where there is little shade from late November until mid-April (Bugg, R.L., pers. comm.). Reestablishment has also been excellent in vineyards in sites as diverse as Ukiah (Mendocino Co.) and Porterville (Tulare Co.). Reseeding by 'Wimmera 62' may not be as consistent as other ryegrasses.  A three to four week growing period (without mowing) must be provided prior to the late May maturity to allow seed to be produced (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Mow temporary lawns of ryegrass no closer than three inches. When ryegrass is used for over-seeding bermuda, the mower should be lowered to one inch cutting height in the spring to kill the ryegrass and leave a clean stand of bermuda.  Ryegrass should be cut no later than early bloom for high quality hay.  Strips of uncut forage should be left to produce seed if another hay crop is to be taken the following year (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be cut no closer to the ground than about 7.5 cm (3 in) (Miller, 1984).  'Wimmera 62' can be mowed frequently during the growing season above 2 inches.  A three to four week growing period must be provided prior to the late May maturity date to allow seed to be produced (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>This species is a host of Bromegrass Mosaic Virus which is transmitted by 2 plant-parasitic nematodes (<I>Xiphinema spp.</I></B>) (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass is a host of Bromegrass Mosaic Virus which is transmitted by 2 plant-parasitic nematodes (<I>Xiphinema</I></B> spp.) (Slykhuis, 1967). Townshend and Davidson (198?) evaluated thirty-five wild and cultivated grasses and 4 forage legumes in small plots and determined that annual ryegrass harbored especially high densities of pin nematode (<I>Paratylenchus projectus</I></B>).  On the other hand, the species harbored particularly low densities of root lesion nematode (<I>Pratylynchus penetrans</I></B>) in an orchard in Ontario, Canada (Marks and Townsend, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>For cv 'Aubade', the three-year average yield during clipping experiments at Tifton, Georgia, in dry forage was 4663 lbs/acre (Morey and Marchant, 1977). Hofstetter (1988) reported that early seeded in September and cut in second week of May yielded 1,736 lb/acre of dry matter.  Slayback (Cantisano, pers. comm.) considered annual ryegrass a heavy producer given good soil fertility but that the species could present unspecified management problems.  About three tons of hay per acre per year can be produced on fertile soils with adequate moisture up to crop harvest (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Annual ryegrass averaged 6,800 lbs/acre dry matter production over four years of field testing under supplemental irrigation in the Central Valley (Morey and Marchant, 1977).  Williams et al.  (1990) obtained 6,800-8,800 lb/ac in four-year study on an irrigated Yolo loam at UC Davis. Bugg et al. (unpublished data) measured total above-ground dry biomass of annual ryegrass called "Oregon Common" in a replicated trial (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991: 8.513 +/- 3.258 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.).  With weeds included, the corresponding figure was 10.990+/-1.642 Mg/ha.<P> Morey and Marchant (1977) reported an 8-year average for common annual ryegrass of 5,286 lbs dry forage/acre, and a three-year average yield during clipping experiments at Tifton, Georgia, as being 4820 lbs dry forage/acre.  For cv 'Gulf' the corresponding three-year average was 5611 and was 5423 for 'Magnolia' (Morey and Marchant, 1977).  Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) reported that Italian [annual] ryegrass (cv 'Deltex') yielded 14.8 Mg dry matter/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>A cover crop of annual ryegrass can increase infiltration by irrigation water (Williams, 1966), and the species has therefore been suggested for vineyards (Christensen et al., 1968)<P> Annual ryegrasses do not fix atmospheric N, but have been used as catch crops to reduce leaching loss of nitrate through the soil profile.  N content of annual ryegrass was presented as 1.37%, and total N as 24 lb/acre by Hofstetter (1988).  For Williams et al. (1990), the corresponding figures were 2.1 to 2.4% and 145 to 210 lb N/ac, with uptake of soil N ranging from 50-235 kg N/a, based on a four-year study on an irrigated Yolo loam at UC Davis.<P> Theiss (1990) indicated that perennial ryegrass does not appear as efficient at N uptake as are annual ryegrass and cocksfoot (<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>) after high initial rates of N fertilization.  However, the release of nitrogen from perennial ryegrass swards apparently takes place later in the autumn than for the other two grasses.  Thick stands of grasses (perennial ryegrass, annual ryegrass and cocksfoot [<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>]) are more effective at N uptake than are open stands.  Drought stress reduced N uptake by annual ryegrass more than by perennial ryegrass or cocksfoot.  Over a 9-month period, a catch crop of annual ryegrass between crops of winter wheat and corn (maize) reduced leaching of fertilizer-derived N from 18.7 to 7.1% of the total N applied (200 kg N/ha) (Theiss, 1990). However, there was some suppression of the following maize crop after the ryegrass was plowed under (Martinez and Guiraud, 1990).<P> In a lysimeter study, Guiraud et al.  (1990) found that a catch crop of annual ryegrass reduced the total amount of nitrate N leached from 124 kg N/ha to 40 kg N/ha.  The percentages of fertilizer nitrogen in the water were 19% under bare fallow and 7% under the catch crop.  To a depth of 30 cm, 23% of labeled N was retained in organic form where ryegrass had been incorporated, versus 15% under bare fallow.<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina'): 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko'): 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex'): 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley - 20.3, rapeseed - 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley - 17.2, rapeseed - 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 14.8. Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>In a trial comparing insect densities under 17 cover-cropping regimes in southern Georgia, annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> cv 'Gulf') harbored few aphids and virtually no associated beneficial insects (e.g., lady beetles [Coccinellidae]). Comparisons of monocultural and bicultural plots showed that interspersion of ryegrass with hairy vetch and crimson clover caused an overall reduction in aphid and coccinellid densities on these legumes, but differences were not consistent through time (Bugg et al., 1990).<P> In southern Oregon pear orchards, some species of understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems.  Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, ryegrass appeared of intermediate favorablity as host of the mite (Flexner et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Like most grasses, annual ryegrass has a fibrous root system (Finch & Sharp, 1983), which can be extensive (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Finch and Sharp (1983) mention that 'Wimmera 62' has "heavy roots."<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Growth habit is erect and robust with vigorous leafy growth (USDA-SCS, 1973; Finch & Sharp, 1983).  The plant grows rapidly, providing quick cover (McLeod, 1982).  'Wimmera 62' has an upright growth habit (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name for annual or Italian ryegrass is <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> Lamarck (Munz, 1973).  For Wimmera ryegrass, the scientific name is <I>Lolium rigidum</I></B> Gaud. (Slayback, pers. comm., Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This species has been termed annual ryegrass (Finch & Sharp, 1983), or Italian Ryegrass (Munz, 1973; McLeod, 1982), and Australian or common ryegrass (USDA-SCS. 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed is relatively inexpensive (USDA-SCS, 1973; Finch & Sharp, 1983; Peaceful Valley, 1988; Miller et al., 1989)<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>In the Pacific Coast and southeastern states, annual ryegrasses should be seeded in the fall (McLeod, 1982; Finch & Sharp, 1983; Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  In the northeastern states, seeding can be in early spring, late summer, or early fall (40 days before killing frost) (Hofstetter, 1988).  McLeod (1982) recommends sowing in the spring in the north to avoid freeze damage.  When overseeding into corn, seed at last cultivation or anytime thereafter or immediately after corn silage harvest (Hofstetter, 1988).  When overseeding into soybeans, seed at leaf-yellowing (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates vary depending on the intended use, the seeding technique, and the authority.  In general, because annual ryegrass does not tiller much, relatively high rates of seeding are recommended, despite the relatively small seed (Miller et al., 1989).  For ryegrass used as a cover crop, seeding rates range from 9 lb/acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983) to 10 to 15 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989) to 20-25 lb/acre (Peaceful Valley, 1988; Hofstetter, 1988) to 25-35 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982).  Slayback (pers. comm.) suggests that 9lbs./acre (80% Pure Live Seed) is adequate if broadcast, 6 lbs/acre drilled.  Recommended seeding rates (USDA-SCS, 1973) in lbs/acre of viable seed are:<P>
<PRE>
    Pasture, Cover Crops, Burns, and Wildlife Habitat: Drilled - 5 lb., Broadcast - 10 lb.
    Critical Area Plantings: Drilled - 15 lb, Broadcast - 30 lb
    Temporary Turf: Precision Seeded - 60 lb, Broadcast - 120 lb
    Overseeding Bermuda Turf: Precision Seeded - 60 lbs - 120 lb
</PRE>
 Other recommendations include 16-22 kg/ha (Riewe and Mondart, 1985), 40 kg/ha for erosion control (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  And the suggestion by Miller, 1984) that both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be sown at 20-28 kg/ha (18-25 lb/a) for pure stands, and 11-17 kg/ha (10-15 lb/a) if sown along with a legume or a small grain.<P> The recommended seeding rate for 'Wimmera 62' is 9 lbs/acre (Finch and Sharp, 1983.).<P> Crimson clover can be grown in conjunction with annual ryegrass. When sown in combination with companion crops, crimson clover is usually sown at 2/3 the normal rate, and the other crop at 1/3 the monocultural rate.  Developmental rates of annual ryegrass and tall fescue are similar to that of crimson clover (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Can be disked down in the spring (Finch & Sharp, 1983).  When used for temporary cover, annual ryegrass should be kept from setting seed by plowing under, disking, or mowing during early bloom (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrasses do not fix atmospheric N, but have been used as catch crops to reduce leaching loss of nitrate through the soil profile.  N content of annual ryegrass was presented as 1.37%, and total N as 24 lb/acre by Hofstetter (1988).  For Williams et al. (1990), the corresponding figures were 2.1 to 2.4% and 145 to 210 lb N/ac, with uptake of soil N ranging from 50-235 kg N/a, based on a four-year study on an irrigated Yolo loam at UC Davis.<P> Theiss (1990) indicated that perennial ryegrass does not appear as efficient at N uptake as are annual ryegrass and cocksfoot (<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>) after high initial rates of N fertilization.  However, the release of nitrogen from perennial ryegrass swards apparently takes place later in the autumn than for the other two grasses.  Thick stands of grasses (perennial ryegrass, annual ryegrass and cocksfoot [<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>]) are more effective at N uptake than are open stands.  Drought stress reduced N uptake by annual ryegrass more than by perennial ryegrass or cocksfoot.  Over a 9-month period, a catch crop of annual ryegrass between crops of winter wheat and corn (maize) reduced leaching of fertilizer-derived N from 18.7 to 7.1% of the total N applied (200 kg N/ha) (Theiss, 1990).  However, there was some suppression of the following maize crop after the ryegrass was plowed under (Martinez and Guiraud, 1990).<P> In a lysimeter study, Guiraud et al. (1990) found that a catch crop of annual ryegrass reduced the total amount of nitrate N leached from 124 kg N/ha to 40 kg N/ha.  The percentages of fertilizer nitrogen in the water were 19% under bare fallow and 7% under the catch crop.  To a depth of 30 cm, 23% of labeled N was retained in organic form where ryegrass had been incorporated, versus 15% under bare fallow.<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina') - 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko') - 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex') - 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley - 20.3, rapeseed - 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley - 17.2, rapeseed - 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae) (Raderschall and Gebhardt, 1990).<P> Foliage of annual ryegrass can accumulate 7 or 30 kg of atmospheric ammonia nitrogen/ha during 6 weeks of the growing period (at the atmospheric concentrations of 6 or 89 micrograms of ammonia nitrogen per cubic meter) (Sommer and Jensen, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD><I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> can be spring- or fall-grazed, hayed, used as cover crop, plowed as green manure, or used as nurse crop for fall-seeded legumes (McLeod, 1982; Miller, 1984; Hofstetter, 1988).  Its rapid growth and the quick cover it affords make it excellent for temporary pasture (McLeod, 1982).  In California, it is often used in preparation for crops that must be planted in the spring, and it can often be grown where other cover crops have not proved satisfactory (Miller et al., 1989).  Its uses include: (1) fall over-seeding of bermudagrass turf; (2) pasture, hay, wildlife habitat; (3) temporary cover for lawns, critical areas, and burned areas; and (4) winter green manure and cover crops for orchards and cropland.  It is a good choice for obtaining fast temporary cover on exposed areas with minimal seedbed preparation (USDA-SCS, 1973).<P> Annual ryegrass shows excellent performance in mature pecan orchards, which have little shade from late November until mid- April (Bugg, R.L, pers. comm.).  Reestablishment has also been xcellent in vineyards in sites as diverse as Ukiah (Mendocino Co.) and Porterville (Tulare Co.).  Annual ryegrass has very vigorous seedlings, and provides rapid ground cover.  It can be used as a cover crop in grass waterways or flood canals, or on cropland subject to flooding (Miller, 1984).  'Wimmera 62' can be used in similar sites as other reseeding annuals, if its high biomass production is not troublesome (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina') - 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko') - 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex') - 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley - 20.3, rapeseed - 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley - 17.2, rapeseed - 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Common annual ryegrass is adapted to many soil types (Hofstetter, 1988) and has been touted as viable on any soil type (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988) but does best on loams or sandy loams.  It is commonly used on poor soils or on sandy or rocky soils where it will normally produce a better growth than will cereal species (Miller et al., 1989).  It can also tolerate clays or clay loams and attendant poor drainage (Slayback, pers. comm.). <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> and <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> will tolerate a wide range of soils and climates, withstand temporary floods, and do better than small grains on wet soils, but perform best on well-drained soils (Miller, 1984).  They will grow on sandy soils if they are well fertilized, but do better on heavier clay or silty soils with adequate drainage (Miller, 1984)<P> 'Wimmera 62' grows on soil types ranging from sandy loams to clays, but medium to heavy textures are best.  This variety is recommended for areas of marginal soil fertility (USDA-SCS, 1973). It tolerates sites with poor drainage (source).  It is well adapted to all orchard and vineyard soils below 3,000 feet (Finch and Sharp, 1983) and is suitable for heavy soils where its high biomass production is not a problem (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>This species tolerates extended wet periods (Hofstetter, 1988); short periods of flooding will not damage a stand, but long periods will (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> and <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> are tolerant of a wide range of soils and climates.  They will tolerate temporary floods, and do better than small grains on wet soils, but perform best on well-drained soils (Miller, 1984).<P> In general, annual ryegrass is adapted to irrigated farming on well-drained land (McLeod, 1982).  <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> and <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> will grow on sandy soils if they are well fertilized, but do better on heavier clay or silty soils with adequate drainage (Miller, 1984).<P> Annual ryegrass has very vigorous seedlings, and provides rapid ground cover.  It can be used as a cover crop im grass waterways or flood canals or on cropland subject to flooding (Miller, 1984). 'Wimmera 62' is suitable for use in areas of relatively low humidity and rainfall, but does best a minimum of 12" of rainfall (USDA-SCS, 1973).  It is more drought tolerant than common ryegrass, but also does well where water ponds (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Common annual ryegrass has biennial tendencies in the northeastern states where it will grow vigorously until dormancy, survive winter, regrow quickly in spring, and produce seed by mid-June (Hofstetter, 1988).  Under farm conditions, few of the plants live more than one year, so the species is generally considered an annual (McLeod, 1982).  In California, this grass is a cool-season or winter-growing annual (USDA-SCS, 1973)<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass seed germninates quickly (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988), and the species is known for rapid growth (McLeod, 1982) and ease of establishment even during cold weather (Miller et al., 1989).  Perennial ryegrass has slower seedling establishment and lower seedling vigor than does annual ryegrass (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>This is a cool-season annual grass that is cold tolerant (Peaceful Valley, 1988) although neither <I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> nor <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> is as winter hardy as timothy or orchardgrass (McLeod, 1982; Miller, 1984).  Annual ryegrass will germinate in cooler soils than most other cover crop and pasture seeds (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>This species is very vigorous and competes well against most weeds (USDA-SCS, 1973; Peaceful Valley, 1988).  When seeded along with legumes or some other grasses, annual and perennial ryegrasses contribute to better control of weeds (Miller, 1984).  In Hopland, Mendocino County,  California, weed above-groundbiomass (dry) in plots sown during late October with ANNUAL RYEGRASS ("OREGON COMMON") was 2.477+/-2.477 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M. (Bugg et al., unpublished data), which was 50.4% of the weed biomass obtained in unseeded control plots.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass. Vegetational cover data by the sown annual ryegrass in May, 1991 was rated as 100.00+/-0.00 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>This species has a heavy, extensive, fibrous root system that holds the soil well and opens it to increased infiltration by water; the vigorous seedlings provide rapid ground cover (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> A cover crop of annual ryegrass can increase infiltration by irrigation water (Williams, 1966), and the species has therefore been suggested for vineyards (Christensen et al., 1968)<P> Annual ryegrasses do not fix atmospheric N but have been used as catch crops to reduce leaching loss of nitrate through the soil profile.  N content of annual ryegrass was presented as 1.37%, and total N as 24 lb/acre by Hofstetter (1988).  For Williams et al. (1990), the corresponding figures were 2.1 to 2.4% and 145 to 210 lb N/ac, with uptake of soil N ranging from 50-235 kg N/a, based on a four-year study on an irrigated Yolo loam at UC Davis.<P> Theiss (1990) indicated that perennial ryegrass does not appear as efficient at N uptake as are annual ryegrass and cocksfoot (<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>) after high initial rates of N fertilization.  However, the release of nitrogen from perennial ryegrass swards apparently takes place later in the autumn than for the other two grasses.  Thick stands of grasses (perennial ryegrass, annual ryegrass and cocksfoot [<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>]) are more effective at N uptake than are open stands.  Drought stress reduced N uptake by annual ryegrass more than by perennial ryegrass or cocksfoot.  Over a 9-month period, a catch crop of annual ryegrass between crops of winter wheat and corn (maize) reduced leaching of fertilizer-derived N from 18.7 to 7.1% of the total N applied (200 kg N/ha) (Theiss, 1990).  However, there was some suppression of the following maize crop after the ryegrass was plowed under (Martinez and Guiraud, 1990).<P> In a lysimeter study, Guiraud et al. (1990) found that a catch crop of annual ryegrass reduced the total amount of nitrate N leached from 124 kg N/ha to 40 kg N/ha.  The percentages of fertilizer nitrogen in the water were 19% under bare fallow and 7% under the catch crop.  To a depth of 30 cm, 23% of labeled N was retained in organic form where ryegrass had been incorporated, versus 15% under bare fallow.<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina') - 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko') - 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex') - 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley - 20.3, rapeseed - 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass - 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley - 17.2, rapeseed - 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass- 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>This species has been recommend for planting with annual legumes to promote nitrogen fixation by the latter and for improved palatability of the resulting hay or pasture (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Graves et al. (1987) planted 'Multicut' berseem and annual ryegrass in mixtures in field trials at Davis (Yolo County, California).  Annual ryegrass alone yielded about half as much biomass as 'Multicut' alone.  The mixtures of 50% and 75% 'Multicut' with ryegrass yielded as much as 'Multicut' alone (13,800 lbs/acre dry matter).  'Multicut' became dominant in all mixtures by the third harvest.  Mixtures of 'Multicut' berseem clover and annual ryegrass combine advantages of both plant species by providing early winter production as well as extending the availability of high quality forage through late spring (Graves et al. 1989).<P> Annual ryegrass is often grown in conjunction with crimson, alsike, or arrowleaf clovers (Miller, 1984).  Adequate phosphorus and potassium are critical when annual ryegrass in grown with a legume (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  When seeded along with legumes (e.g., annual reseeding species) or some other grasses (e.g., perennial ryegrass), annual and perennial ryegrasses contribute to better control of weeds (Miller, 1984).  In such situations, the annual ryegrass establishes first and suppresses weeds (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be sown along with small grains, such as cereal rye and to some extent oat. Oat does not complement ryegrasses as well, because forage is produced at the same time (Miller, 1984).  Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be seeded into bermuda grass sod (Miller, 1984).<P> Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be sown at 20-28 kg/ha (18- 25 lb/a) for pure stands, and 11-17 kg/ha (10-15 lb/a) if sown along with a legume or a small grain (Miller, 1984).<P> Crimson clover can be grown in conjunction with rye, vetches, annual ryegrass, and various cereals.  When sown in combination with companion crops, crimson clover is usually sown at 2/3 the normal rate and the other crop at 1/3 the monocultural rate. Developmental rates of annual ryegrass and tall fescue are similar to that of crimson clover (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass is not a legume and requires no inoculant (Bugg, R.L., pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>To harvest seed, cut annual ryegrass when one or two florets dislodge from most heads as heads are pulled lightly through the fingers.  Windrow and allow to dry for several days prior to threshing.  Dry seed to 12% moisture prior to threshing (Riewe et al., 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass is shade intolerant (Riewe and Mondart, 1985)<P> Annual ryegrass shows excellent performance in mature pecan orchards (in Southern Georgia) which have little shade from late November until mid-April (Bugg, R.L., pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be sown along with small grains, such as cereal rye and to some extent oat.  Oat does not complement ryegrasses as well because forage is produced at the same time.  Ryegrasses may equal small grains in forage quality and exceed them in production.  When sown in mixtures with small grains, ryegrasses extend the spring grazing season (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information was available on the salinity tolerance of annual ryegrass.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass can be controlled using weed oil or non-persistent contact herbicides (SCS, 1973), including glyphosate (Bugg, pers. comm.). Chlorsulfuron (Telar) inhibits germination of annual ryegrass (Lanini, pers. comm.) and can be used to reduce this plant as a weed in native perennial grass stands.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Annual (Italian) ryegrass flowers from June through August, according to Munz (1973).  This is later than wild oat or ripgut brome.  By comparison with the latter two grasses, annual ryegrass is usually restricted to moister sites in the Sacramento Valley (Bugg, pers. obs.).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass can be mowed or incorporated like any annual cover crop, and has no special equipment needs (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass hay contains typically contains 13 lbs P2O2/ton, 37 lbs K2O/ton, and has a C/N ratio of 24 (Parnes, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No specific information was available on the effects on microclimate by annual ryegrass.  Annual ryegrass stays green later than most varieties of barley, oat, or rye, and hence might be expected to transpire more and have a greater cooling effect during late spring in orchards or vineyards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>No information was available on the vertebrate pest effects of annual ryegrass; in general, annual grasses do not support gophers as do perennial legumes (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Annual ryegrass has a low requirement for lime (McLeod, 1982) and can assimilate as much as 200 lbs N/acre/yr (Graves and Munoz, 1987).  It is considered a heavy user of N and often responds favorably to added P on eroded soils.  Typical fertilizer application on new critical area and lawn seeding is 100 lbs nitrogen and 50 lbs phosphoric acid (P2O5) worked into the soil surface during seedbed preparation (USDA-SCS, 1973). Continued heavy production of hay or pasture will require 75 to 100 lbs/acre of nitrogen each fall (USDA-SCS, 1973).  Phosphorus and potassium are critical when annual ryegrass in grown with a legume (Riewe and Mondart, 1985).  'Wimmera 62' has lower fertility requirements than common ryegrass (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982)<P> Recommended depth for common annual, 'Wimmera 62' and perennial ryegrasses is one-half inch (USDA-SCS, 1973; Finch and Sharp, 1983; Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Stored seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>

<H1>SAREP Staff Changes</H1>
<P>
After nearly seven years with SAREP, Chuck Ingels has taken a
new job as UC Cooperative Extension farm advisor in Sacramento
County. Ingels was SAREP's perennial cropping systems analyst.
His many accomplishments during his tenure with SAREP include
his work to form the UC Cover Crops Workgroup (see page 2), his
development of information on attracting barn owls to farms, his
participation as a management team member for the Biologically
Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program for walnuts in Yolo
and Solano counties, and his production of the UC publication
Protecting Groundwater Quality in Citrus Production (ANR Publication
No. 21521). Ingels is also coordinating the writing of Cover Cropping
in Vineyards: A Grower's Handbook, an extensive publication which
will include contributions from 21 UC and Natural Resources Conservation
Service personnel; it is expected to be published by UC ANR Publications
in 1997.
<P>
Ingels' areas of responsibility as a Sacramento County farm advisor
will include pomology (mainly pears), viticulture, and environmental
horticulture. He will also coordinate Sacramento's large Master
Gardener program. Ingels is replacing Roger Duncan, who is now
a pomology/viticulture farm advisor in Stanislaus County.
<P>
Ingels' extensive experience working with farmers and researchers
throughout the state, his mediation skills, thoughtful and conscientious
manner, tremendous writing output and seemingly endless energy
will be sorely missed by his colleagues at SAREP. We send him
off with our best wishes for a successful career, and are happy
that he is staying in the &quot;Cooperative Extension&quot; family.

<H1>Low-Input Stone Fruit Pest Control Meeting<BR>
</H1>
<P>
The UC Kearney Agricultural Center was the site of a January 5
workshop aimed at stone fruit growers seeking to reduce chemical
inputs. &quot;Stone Fruit Pest Management Strategies:
<P>
Past, Present and Future,&quot; was organized by <B>Scott Johnson</B>,
extension pomologist, and<B> Bill Barnett</B>, area IPM advisor,
and drew more than 100 people.
<H3>Prevention</H3>
<P>
<B>Joe Ogawa</B>, a plant pathology professor at UC Davis, began
the workshop with a discussion of disease control strategies.
He noted that before the 1930s, disease management was directed
solely against the pathogen through the use of chemical fungicides
including sulfurs, coppers and chlorine solutions.  Numerous synthetic
fungicides developed since then provide protection against infection
(protectants), but resistance to some has occurred, Ogawa said.
Preventative measures for brown rot continue to be important,
including greater care to prevent injury to fruit at harvest,
and the improvement of postharvest handling. Current brown rot
control focuses on reducing the spread of insects that injure
fruit and create fungus infection sites, he said. Ogawa said new
fungicides will be part of future disease control, as well as
biological control measures including &quot;inducing multiplication
of antagonist bacteria on host surfaces&quot; for brown rot control.
Non-chemical insect control strategies to reduce the spread of
brown rot, and new cultivars resistant to various diseases will
also be important, he said. Ogawa emphasized the need for forecasting
systems to predict disease incidence levels based on moisture
and temperature data.
<H3>Nematodes</H3>
<P>
<B>Howard  Ferris</B>,  professor  of nematology at UC Davis,
outlined a six-point  management  plan  for nematodes. He said
the first step is to evaluate the potential orchard site by researching
crop history and soil conditions, and determine nematode levels
throughout the field. Second, the site must be prepared by removing
roots or other refuse which may harbor nematodes, and by improving
soil physical conditions. It may then be necessary to reduce nematode
population levels, preferably in a manner which conserves beneficial
soil organisms, said Ferris. If preplant fumigation is used, it
may be advantageous to inoculate the soil with beneficial organisms,
he said. The fourth step is to plant resistant (or tolerant) rootstocks,
although he cautioned that no rootstock is resistant to all nematodes.
The fifth step is to use orchard management practices which reduce
tree stress. Finally, he discussed reducing harmful nematode population
levels by encouraging beneficial nematodes and fungi.  Nematicides
have in some cases been shown to completely eliminate parasitization
activity, he said. Ferris also said that an attempt to increase
the level of beneficial organisms by adding manure failed to reduce
nematode populations significantly.<BR>
<H3>Historians</H3>
<P>
Jerry Uyemoto, plant pathologist at UC Davis, discussed current
and past stone fruit virus disease management. He emphasized the
need for strategists to become historians in order to manage recurring
virus diseases. Frequently a disorder diagnosed as a new disease
is caused by a previously identified pathogen, but because of
different scion/rootstock combinations, unrecognized symptoms
occur, he said.  Future virus disease management will be aided
by the use of resistant scions or rootstocks, although progress
may be slow for perennial crops such as stone fruits.
<H3>Pheromones</H3>
<P>
Pheromone use in stone fruit orchards was the subject of a talk
by <B>Dick Rice</B>, an entomologist at Kearney Agricultural Center.
 He said that until the 1960s, pest control research was directed
primarily toward the screening, development and registration of
new pesticides. In the 1970s researchers synthesized sex pheromones,
which are airborne chemicals produced by an insect species to
attract the opposite sex for mating. Sex pheromones had been used
for the development of seasonal trapping data, but later became
useful as a means to determine the timing of sprays. In 1985 the
concept of mating disruption, or male confusion, was introduced
in California. Mating disruption involves releasing pheromones
into the orchard to disrupt the movement of male moths to female
moths. It has proven effective and cost-competitive in oriental
fruit moth control compared to standard spray treatments in spite
of some limitations, Rice said. Pest management efforts will continue
to include integration of existing technology, increased use of
biological and cultural controls, and the development of resistant
cultivars, he said.<BR>
<H3>Biological Control</H3>
<P>
Final discussions focused on the potential for biological control
in stone fruits.  <B>Kent Daane</B>, biocontrol specialist at
Kearney Agricultural Center, discussed the three tactics of biological
control: 1) classical: collecting predators or parasites from
different areas and releasing them in an infested region, 2) conservation:
using an alternate host or a breeding site, such as a cover crop,
to increase beneficial insect populations, and 3) augmentation:
the mass release of natural enemies such as green lacewing and
parasitic wasps. Daane said augmentation will be the most important
method of the future, except in the case of lady bird beetles,
which fly away if they are released. They must be attracted to
areas where they are needed by the establishment of habitats.
It is important to make sure that purchased insects are healthy,
with a high proportion of female insects, Daane said. Biological
control of insects that attack fresh fruit is more complicated,
because consumers do not tolerate much cosmetic damage.
<H3>Mites</H3>
<P>
Biological control of mites, which attack the leaves, is easier
to achieve because larger pest populations can be tolerated, according
to <B>Bill Barnett</B>, area IPM advisor. Several insect predators
can be important in controlling the two-spotted and Pacific mites,
the most serious mite pests of stone fruits, but the western orchard
predator mite <I>(Metasieulus occidentalis) </I>can give complete
control in non-stressed and non-disrupted orchards, he said. The
peach silver mite, which can be tolerated in high numbers, should
be preserved as alternate prey for the western orchard predator
mite, he said. Releases of predators can help to establish populations
in orchards that have none, but in most situations this practice
is unnecessary, Barnett said.<BR>

<P>
This article highlights selected research of farm advisors in
Fresno and Madera counties. Information was gathered at two 1995
meetings of the farm advisors and SAREP staff, and from personal
and written interviews. <BR>

<H3>FRESNO COUNTY</H3>

<P>
<B>Steve Sutter:</B> Sutter started with Fresno Cooperative Extension
in 1990 and serves Fresno, Kings, Madera and Tulare counties.
He works in the Agricultural Personnel Management Program, which
is a special UC program started in 1981 to work on issues of labor
management and safety. There are only two agricultural personnel
management farm advisors and one specialist in the state. His
colleagues are <B>Gregory Billikopf</B> who is housed in Modesto
and serves Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin counties, and <B>Howard
Rosenberg</B>, a specialist housed at UC Berkeley.
<P>
Sutter says he handled 2,500 calls regarding agricultural personnel
issues in 1994 and expects to exceed that count in 1995. Additionally,
he presented more than 70 talks for employees and supervisors
around the state. He works on laws and regulatory issues, safety
training, development of job descriptions, and EPA worker protection
standard training. Sutter noted that he &quot;tries to run with
the issues&quot; and respond to current concerns. In 1991 he worked
hard to procure relief for farm laborers and farmers during the
disastrous citrus freeze. He runs a monthly farm labor contractor
round-table to discuss issues and help resolve problems.
<P>
He has developed many leaflets, including at least one with an
audio cassette narration in Spanish; a checklist of labor regulations
(OSHA, Department of Labor, EPA); and safety programs in English
and Spanish. He compiled a 43-page booklet on EPA worker protection
standards. Since Sutter is not bilingual, he relies on community
members for translation when necessary. He has developed a set
of postcards for employers to use for ordering required posters
from various sources. He also writes a newsletter distributed
statewide with a circulation of 3,700. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT><B>Michael Costello:</B> 
Costello is the new viticulture farm
advisor, and has been on the job since February 1995. Over the
past three years a SAREP grant has partially supported his research,
which investigated the effects of cover crops on spiders and the
variegated leafhopper. He found that, contrary to popular belief,
maintaining vineyard ground covers in the spring and summer does
not affect the population of canopy spiders compared to clean
cultivation. On the other hand, ground covers lowered leafhopper
numbers, probably because they also decreased vine vigor.<BR>

<P>
More recently, Costello has helped organize a biologically integrated
vineyard systems (BIVS) group in the central San Joaquin Valley.
This project uses the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS) model, which brings together researchers, growers and pest
control advisors (PCAs) to assess ways to enhance all vineyard
inputs, and curtail those which are disruptive to the vineyard
ecosystem or which are environmentally detrimental. So far twelve
Fresno area growers are enrolled in the BIVS program, and strategies
include: reducing rates of the herbicide simazine, using 'Cahaba
white' vetch and compost to mitigate nematode pressure, and using
summer oil for mite control. BIVS vineyards will be closely monitored
beginning in the spring of 1996. The program was initiated through
a grant from the US-EPA.
<P>
<B>Mark Freeman: </B>Freeman is working on several citrus projects,
including a study with <B>John Menge</B> and <B>Ole Becker </B>of
UC Riverside which is investigating the effects of mulches, compost
and biocontrol agents on the health of citrus roots. <B>Neil O'Connell</B>,
a Tulare County farm advisor, is collaborating with Freeman on
a new project which will investigate different citrus ground floor
practices on fruit yield and quality. Freeman is also working
on a project investigating the safe use of citrus herbicides,
including limiting their movement from fields, with <B>Tim Prather</B>
of Kearney Agricultural Center (KAC), O'Connell and <B>Kurt Hembree</B>,
a Fresno farm advisor. Freeman is involved in work on controlling
ant damage in citrus with <B>Harry Shorey </B>of UC Riverside.
Additionally, he is working on efficient citrus irrigation techniques.
<P>
Freeman's continuing almond projects include work with rootstocks
and selected varieties, fire ant control, irrigation, and control
of hull rot and bloom diseases. He is also involved in a project
investigating the effect of barn owls on pocket gophers with <B>Lee
Fitzhugh</B>, a wildlife biology specialist at UC Davis. That
project was recently supplemented with a grant from the federal
Renewal Resource Extension Act, which will result in a scientifically
based manual about predatory birds of California. Freeman is pursuing
funding to conduct more work with <B>Desley Whisson</B>, a UC
Davis wildlife biology specialist, on monitoring methods and thresholds
for pocket gophers found in orchards.
<P>
<B>Kurt Hembree:</B> Hembree was hired as the vegetation management
farm advisor in December 1994. He works primarily with PCAs and
growers. Previously he was a staff research associate in Fresno
County for eight years, working in both IPM and conventional weed
control.
<P>
 He is investigating deep plowing for nutsedge control. Preliminary
results indicate that this method suppresses the nutsedge until
the crop gets established, but does not provide complete control.
He notes that questions remain, including what effect this practice
will have on nematodes, pathogens or salts, or what interval will
be required between plowing.
<P>
Hembree believes that research should consider the economic impact
of practices. He feels that if a method is not economical, the
PCAs aren't likely to use it. For example, his work on alternatives
to herbicides in tomatoes showed that it was more expensive to
monitor for weeds than to use herbicides. 
<P>
He says it is difficult to obtain long-term research funding,
which is important to find more complete answers to questions.
As an example, he has a trial using synthetic mats to reduce weeds
around microsprinklers in citrus. The mats are saving labor, and
herbicide rates are down about 10 percent. However, he notes that
it is important to look at how long the mats last. He has found
that within five years citrus roots grow up into the mats. He
is not sure what impact this will have on herbicide use, diseases,
or other pest effects. 
<P>
Hembree is collaborating with <B>Tim Prather</B> at KAC on &quot;smart
spray&quot; machine technology to reduce the amount of post-emergent
herbicide needed to control seedling weeds in deciduous orchards
and vineyards.
<P>
<B>Dan Munk:</B> Munk conducts research and extension on soil
fertility, irrigation, land issues, and cotton. He works with
PCAs and agronomists on soil fertility and cover crops, composts,
and fertilizers, as well as with the cotton industry on improving
cotton production practices. One of Munk's projects involves using
gin trash on cotton fields.
<P>
Munk is very interested in the issue  of chemicals for defoliation
and weed control in cotton. He notes that industry is sensitive
to the impacts of defoliants, i.e., public sensitivity to defoliants
regarding reports of sinus problems and other health issues.
<P>
Munk, along with farm advisors <B>Alan Fulton </B>(Kings), <B>Bill
Weir </B>(Merced-Fresno), <B>Blake Sanden </B>(Kern) and <B>Brent
Holtz </B>(Madera), publishes the <I>Agricultural Resource Manager</I>,
a newsletter to &quot;encourage the wise use of soil and water
resources in the San Joaquin Valley.&quot; He also publishes the
<I>California Cotton Review</I>. He notes that it is difficult
to find grants for interdisciplinary newsletters and has been
working to find supplemental funding for the <I>Agricultural Resource
Manager</I> for the last two years. [Contact Munk at (209) 456-7561
for information about his publication.]
<P>
He is working with irrigation districts on a project that uses
water meters to help schedule irrigations and improve farm water
management. He has conducted drip irrigation meetings on the West
Side (the use of drip tape in row crops) in cooperation with Davis
extension specialists and works on other methods of reducing drainage
on West Side irrigated lands.
<P>
Munk is also involved in developing methods of managing cotton
through detailed plant observation (growth, fruit development/retention.)
From May through July he holds monthly meetings for cotton growers
to discuss these ideas, as well as pesticide management and agronomy
decisions. 
<P>
Munk is working with <B>Stu Pettygrove</B> from UC Davis on a
project to compost gin trash and municipal yard waste, sewage
sludge and manures. He assesses gin trash applied to crops for
its effects on yield, soil nitrogen levels, and plant petiole
nutrient levels. 
<P>
He notes that <B>Sean Swezey's</B> UC Santa Cruz conversion study
from conventional to organic production in cotton has come up
with good plant-based information. 
<P>
<B>Rich Coviello:</B> Coviello has been working with Cooperative
Extension since 1981. Previously he worked with <B>Charlie Curtis</B>
(USDA) on almond winter sanitation, and with <B>Charlie Summers</B>
(KAC) doing population ecology studies in various field and vegetable
crops.
<P>
He is involved in a study to determine the damage threshold of
thrips, an insect pest which significantly reduces processing
onion yield and quality. This is new information and will allow
growers to use an objective treatment threshold rather than a
subjective &quot;seat-of-the- pants&quot; estimation, he says.

<P>
Coviello is also studying the timing of omnivorous leafroller
(OLR) treatment. The objective of this project is to develop data
to use the existing phenology model of omnivorous leafroller to
accurately time treatments based on degree-days as is used for
other pests such as peach twig borer (PTB) and San Jose scale.
This information is essential for the effective use of biorational
pesticides such as <I>Bacillus thuringiensis</I> (Bt) products.

<P>
In cooperation with IPM specialist emeritus <B>Bill Barnett</B>,
Coviello explored the use and timing of Bt sprays as an alternative
to organophosphate sprays at bloom to control PTB in stone fruits
and almonds. Currently, materials are applied at early bloom and
petal fall. He feels that it is important to correlate these applications
with the phenology of the pest rather than the phenology of the
plant, since they do not always coincide. Coviello notes that
pheromone traps are not effective for tracking pest numbers for
treatment. Rather, they indicate whether a pest is present and
where it is in its life cycle. 
<P>
Coviello participated in the release of biological control agents
for the control of the ash whitefly, a new pest of ornamentals
in the Central San Joaquin Valley. The biological control agents
were successfully established by <B>Charlie Pickett</B> and colleagues
at the California Department of Food and Agriculture's Division
of Biological Control Program, and ash whitefly is no longer a
serious pest. He is also evaluating conventional and biorational
pesticides for the control of onion thrips, serpentine leafminers,
melon aphids and silverleaf whiteflies.
<P>
During the past five years, Coviello has cooperated on a project
funded by the UC IPM Project and the California Energy Commission
to validate and demonstrate sampling methods for worm pests in
processing tomatoes. Most PCAs are using at least some portion
of the methodology determined by this project for making management
decisions.
<P>
Ants continue to be a serious problem in almonds, causing significant
damage to nut meats and disrupting naturally occurring biological
control agents. Coviello will be cooperating with several researchers
looking at various means of managing ant populations using selective
baits with insect growth regulators. This may help maintain predaceous
and beneficial ant species while controlling damaging species.
<BR>

<H3>MADERA COUNTY</H3>

<P>
<B>Ron Vargas:</B> County Director Vargas has been working for
the university in Madera County for 23 years. His appointment
is 40 percent county director and 60 percent agronomic crops and
weeds farm advisor. He is the interim cotton specialist. 
<P>
He has been working on an alfalfa interplanting trial that started
in Madera County. Others have now joined the study which expanded
to become a regional project. The northern part of the state has
been added. The objective is to interplant alfalfa with oats to
mitigate the use of herbicides in seedling alfalfa. In some cases
the study found they could reduce herbicide use. Another problem
is the invasion of weeds as alfalfa gets older. They are now looking
at overseeding grasses and some clovers in old stands to reduce
weeds and increase the feed value of alfalfa hay. Many herbicides
cannot be used in the older alfalfa stands because of plant-back
restrictions. <B>Tim Prather</B> at KAC is also involved in the
study. It was funded through the  UC IPM Project for implementation
and demonstration. A recent survey of Fresno and Madera counties
showed 20 percent of growers had tried or currently use this practice.
<P>
Vargas also works on cotton variety development for regional adaptability
and resistance to verticillium wilt. Six Central Valley cotton
farm advisors meet regularly and coordinate their work on cotton
in general. 
<P>
He is also working on a three-year project supported by Cotton
Inc. investigating nitrogen and groundwater contamination. The
project is looking at nitrogen rates on cotton. He has found as
yield potentials increase, growers usually increase nitrogen inputs,
which may not be necessary. The USDA is using a deep soil probe
to trace nitrogen applications to cotton.
<P>
Defoliant studies are also part of Vargas's responsibility. He
notes that defoliants may pose a public relations problem. He
is investigating new materials and techniques that are odor-free
and require lower application rates.
<P>
He is also working with Prather at the KAC investigating deep
plowing (12 inches) using a new plow design for nutgrass, annual
morning glory, and nightshade control. Preliminary data show a
reduction in weed populations. Current work is aimed at determining
how often the treatment needs to be repeated, since the practice
may actually bring up buried seed if repeated the following year.

<P>
Vargas is also cooperating on <B>Sean Swezey's</B> UC Santa Cruz
organic cotton project. The objective is to study the conversion
from conventional to organic cotton production. The energy component
was funded by a California Energy Commission grant. They are completing
their third year. <B>Karen Klonsky</B>, an agricultural economics
specialist at UC Davis, is performing the cost study.
<P>
<B>Brent Holtz</B>: Holtz is the new pomology farm advisor in
Madera County. He just finished a postdoctoral appointment at
the KAC where he worked with <B>Themis Michailides</B> investigating
the brown rot disease. Their work included a study which compared
brown rot levels in orchards using a conventional approach to
fertilization and pest control, and orchards that emphasized soil
fertility and management through summer cover corps, both annually
planted and native grasses. The study, <I>A Multidisciplinary
Approach to Evaluate and Aid the Transition from Conventional
to Low Input Pest Management Systems in Stone Fruits</I>, was
funded by the USDA-SARE program.
<P>
Holtz is continuing to work on cultural control of brown rot.
He is interested in finding inoculum sources and notes that the
literature shows conflicting reports on disease sources in the
field. He says that since the 1940s most brown rot control has
been through the use of fungicides. He has found that the cultural
control of inoculum sources includes the removal of mummies from
the trees. The cost of this practice can average up to $35/acre,
since old mummies must be removed from the orchard, not just dropped
to the orchard floor. He notes that the timing of this removal
is also critical. Holtz suggests that the best practice is to
drop all fruit to the orchard floor right after harvest before
infected fruit has had a chance to form mummies. He will continue
some of this work in his new role as farm advisor.<BR>

<H1><U><I>From the Director</I></U><I>- </I>Why Change?</H1>
<P>
This issue of <B>Sustainable Agriculture News</B> is primarily
about the transition facing California agricultural producers.
 The need to develop farming Systems that are more economically
viable, environmentally sound and socially just continues to be
a high priority for California farmers and ranchers.  Even though
the 1990 environmental initiatives did not pass, the need for
California agriculture to become more environmentally sensitive
is still very important in a market-driven  economy.  Syndicated
columnist <B>Thomas Elias</B> recently wrote a column entitled
&quot;Deja Vu Surrounds Big Green.&quot;  In it he discussed the
defeat of the 1972 environmental  initiative  Proposition  9 Proponents
and opponents of that initiative were the same as those who took
sides on one of the 1990 environmental initiatives, Proposition
128 (&quot;Big Green&quot;), which would have restricted the use
of many agricultural chemicals.  The lesson of this clash, according
to Elias, is that the battle does not end on election day.  Within
ten years of its defeat, almost every part of the 1972 environmental
initiative was law.  The measure would have banned lead in gasoline,
banned DDT, mandated limits on political donations, and sought
a moratorium on building nuclear power plants.  Within three years
lead was removed from gasoline, DDT was off the market, strict
limits were put on political donations (which lasted until a judge
threw them out in October 1990), and no new atomic power plants
were licensed.  We must remember this lesson in our agricultural
planning.  By making the changes society wants, agriculture is
moving in the same direction as its customers.  Agriculture can
begin to set its own agenda, and as <B>Len Richardson</B> of <B>California
Farmer</B> said, send a &quot;we care&quot; message.  When we
send a &quot;we care&quot; message, no public relations firm is
needed to prop up agriculture's image.  Farming practices take
care of that, and agriculture sells itself.  <I>-Bill Liebhardt
director, UC Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Education
Program.<BR>

</H1>
<P>
Fifty researchers, educators, and growers met in Davis July 18-19
to discuss their experiences with cover crops, green manures,
and living mulches in orchards, vineyards, vegetables, and field
crops. Sponsored by UC SAREP with funding from the USDA's Alternative
Agricultural Opportunities program, the purpose of the small meeting
was to stimulate interaction among people with both research and
practical experience. The information presented is being compiled
by SAREP for publications, grower meetings, and other research
and extension purposes. Similar meetings in other states within
the western U.S. are planned as part of a two-year grant from
the USDA's Low-Input/Sustainable Agriculture program.<BR>
<P>
The first day's presentations included four sessions: <I>Soil
and Water, Nematodes, Weeds, </I>and <I>Databases. </I>The second
day began with a visit to research projects at the UC Davis Student
Experimental Farm and continued with presentations on <I>Insects
and Mites, </I>and <I>Grower Experiences, </I>and concluded with
small group discussions. The following summaries are from the
<I>Soil and Water </I>session on Day 1.
<H3>Summer Cover Crops</H3>
<P>
San Benito County Farm Advisor <B>Richard Smith</B> began the
meeting with results of his work on summer cover crops in Stanislaus
and San Benito counties. Summer covers are important as a source
of nitrogen for organic farmers, particularly for winter vegetables.
<I>Crotalaria juncea </I>(Sunn hemp) produced well in Stanislaus
County, producing 137 pounds of N per acre in the tops 93 days
alter the first irrigation. The <I>Crotalaria </I>was so productive
that it vastly outstripped the watergrass being grown for comparison.
Their growth rate was similar up to 78 days after irrigation,
then the <I>Crotalaria </I>produced approximately one ton of biomass
per acre in the next two weeks, while the watergrass almost stopped
growing. This difference in growth pattern made it difficult to
estimate how much of the <I>Crotalaria's </I>N came from fixation
and how much from the soil profile, since the usual method of
subtracting the N in the non-legume (watergrass) from the N in
the legume <I>(Crotalaria) </I>would be misleading with such different
biomass amounts.<BR>
<P>
Smith is continuing this work in San Benito County, which has
a much cooler climate. There he is trying winter legumes (Cahaba
white vetch and Lana woollypod vetch) and summer legumes (cowpea),
and Merced rye for a non-legume comparison, all planted as summer
covers in mid-May. In this first year of the study, the vetches
produced about twice as much biomass as the cowpeas alter 45 days.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mark van Horn</B>, manager of the UCD Student Experimental
Farm, is in his third year of work with summer covers. The objective
is high biomass production and nitrogen fixation with minimal
irrigation and both economic and energetic efficiency: a low-input
system. He has looked at cowpeas, <I>Crotalaria, Sesbania, </I>and
<I>Lablab, </I>a tropical forage. Van Horn planted them into moisture
(furrow irrigation), about 20 lb/acre in two rows per 30-inch
bed (due to his equipment; alternatively, they could be drilled.)
A second irrigation occurs at about 25-30 days, then the cover
is plowed down at 60-75 days. So far, cowpeas look the best, since
seed is readily available and farmers know how to grow them. <I>Crotalaria
</I>has the potential to fix more N than cowpeas: Van Horn has
observed <I>80-130 </I>lbs/acre in <I>Crotalaria </I>vs. 70-120
lbs/acre in cowpeas.  The literature says <I>Crotalaria </I>can
reduce rootknot nematodes and according to Van Horn it seems to
be well adapted to the Davis area, but seed is expensive at $3/lb.
<I>Crotalaria </I>does flower in Davis, but Van Horn hasn't yet
been able to get it to set seed, which would save costs but potentially
create a weed problem. Setting seed might reduce its N value,
however, since it keeps producing vegetative growth longer than
cowpeas, which seem to shut down when they produce seed. <I>Sesbania
</I>isn't quite as well adapted to the low irrigation regime,
he said, having produced only 50-100 lb N/acre in his trials,
and the seed isn't available commercially.<BR>
<P>
Van Horn is testing a number of strains of each cover crop. An
indeterminate variety of cowpeas might be a better N producer
than the commercially available determinant variety. He said he
may also develop water response curves, and wants to look at pest
effects. He is interested in investigating <I>Crotalaria's </I>reported
ability to reduce rootknot nematodes, and its apparent tendency
to attract lygus bugs. If the attracted bugs moved to a cash crop,
the <I>Crotalaria </I>would be unacceptable, but it might have
a positive effect if it acted as a trap crop.
<H3>Green Manure, Rice Straw Interactions</H3>
<P>
Extension specialist <B>Stu Pettygrove</B> reported on a new rice
cover crop project underway since last fall in Butte and Sacramento
counties. Winter covers were common in rice until the 1960s. Information
is available from past research on their value as a nitrogen source,
but the older research may not relate well to current rice varieties,
Pettygrove said. He said older information on rice straw management
does not consider the integration of cover crop and straw management.
With a planning grant last year from UC SAREP and a current grant
from the Rice Research Board, Pettygrove and a team of UC research
and extension workers are studying the effect of rice straw incorporation
on subsequent green manure growth and N fixation, and the effect
of green manure on the decomposition of rice straw.
<H3>Winter Cover Crops</H3>
<P>
<B>Rick Miller</B>, a UC Davis agronomy graduate student, is quantifying
the effects of legumes on a subsequent corn crop in a study begun
in 1986. Corn yields following each of six winter covers (oats,
oat/vetch combination, Lana woollypod vetch, bell beans, Austrian
winter peas, and berseem clover) were compared with winter fallow
and spring fertilization (0, <I>50, </I>100, 150, 200, or 250
lb/acre ammonium sulfate broadcast before bedding up). Miller
said corn response to bell beans was approximately equivalent
to the 100 lb/acre fertilizer, while the response to vetch was
about the same as the 200 lb/acre fertilizer (see table.) Since
the yields were comparable to an amount of mineral fertilizer
similar to that contained in the cover crop biomass, it was concluded
that nearly all of the N from the cover crop was completely available
in the first year after incorporation.<BR>
<P>
Miller noted that bell beans haven't done as well in Davis as
in coastal areas. He said each cover has been grown in the same
place for three years, and the bell beans have been declining,
perhaps because of root diseases. Rice growers like bell beans
because they tolerate poor drainage well, but the vetch is clearly
superior at this site, Miller said.
<H3>Cover Crops, Soil Crust Strength</H3>
<P>
The effect of cover crops on organic carbon accumulation and soil
crust strength, and the effect of crust strength on tomato seedling
emergence was investigated by graduate student <B>Kathleen Groody</B>
and <B>Mike Singer</B>, UCD Land, Air and Water Resources professor.
Groody used a soil micropenetrometer to measure crust strength
in three replications of each of three cover cropped plots (oats,
oats/vetch, and vetch) and three treatments with chemical fertilizer
roughly comparable to the cover cropped plots (0, 150 and 200
lb/acre N, respectively) from Rick Miller's study. Not all results
have been statistically analyzed Groody said, but it appears that
the cover cropped plots had higher organic matter, dramatically
reduced crust strength and better seedling emergence than in the
comparable chemically fertilized plots. Crust strength appeared
to increase with increasing fertilizer N, but decrease with increasing
cover crop-derived N.

<H3>FDA Approves Bovine Growth Hormone</H3>

<P>
On November 5, 1993 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced
approval of bovine growth (bGH or bST), ending a nine-year regulatory
review of the controversial biotechnology product. In addition,
the FDA indicated that it will not require milk produced with
the synthetic hormone to be labeled as such. A 90-day moratorium
on commercial sale of the product took effect immediately, as
approved by Congress during the 1993-94 budget bill negotiations.
During the moratorium period, the Office of Management and Budget
is studying the potential economic effects of bGH on dairy farmers.
Many dairy processors, including the processors of 80 percent
of California's milk, have planned a &quot;voluntary moratorium&quot;
on milk produced with bGH. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Washington State Suspends Mevinphos Use</H3>

<P>
The state of Washington recently suspended use of the insecticide
mevinphos in fruit orchards after 18 farm workers were poisoned
by the chemical. Most of the victims were involved in mixing or
spraying the chemical, which is also known by its brand name Phosdrin.
The pesticide is commonly used to control aphids on apple and
pear orchards. Washington Department of Agriculture officials
noted that the toxicity of the chemical is so high that it cannot
be washed off fast enough if it gets on the skin. Amvac, maker
of the product, stood by the safety of the product. Farm worker
advocates hailed the ban as one of the few times a pesticide has
been banned due to farm worker health rather than harm to consumers.
Mevinphos is currently registered for use in California orchards,
but the California Department of Pesticide Regulation is sending
a notice of impending suspension to the manufacturers, who will
be required to do toxicity studies by next spring. The U.S. EPA
is considering a nationwide ban on the product. For more information
see &quot;EPA's Region 10 Issues Warning to Prevent More Poisoning
Incidents From Exposure to Pesticide Phosdrin,&quot; EPA Press
Release, August 20, 1993 <BR>
<BR>

<H3>USDA to Double School Produce Purchases</H3>

<P>
The USDA has announced a new &quot;fresh start&quot; program intended
to improve the nutritional quality of school meals. The department
pledged to double its purchase of fruits and vegetables for school
meals, for a new total of 18 million pounds per year. Despite
the increase, fresh produce will still account for a small percentage
of the 1 billion pounds of commodities purchased by the USDA for
school lunches. For more information or to make written comments
on the Fresh Start Program, contact &quot;Nutrition Objectives,&quot;

<H3>Herbicide-Tolerant Crops and California Farmworkers</H3>

<P>
A recent survey of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development found that herbicide tolerance is the most commonly
field-tested trait in genetically engineered crop trials. For
example, Monsanto has sought to develop genetically engineered
canola to tolerate glyphosate. Glyphosate is one of the top ten
chemicals in terms of worker illness in California agriculture.
Calgene has recently asked for permission from the USDA to begin
large scale field testing of bromoxynil-tolerant cotton. Bromoxynil,
a proven mutagen, is readily absorbed through the skin, and both
the California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencies have
increased worker protection requirements for its use. For more
information see<I> The Pesticide Action</I> <I>Network</I> Updates
Service, August 31,1993, or call PANNA at (415) 541-9140. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Genetically Engineered Food Labeling</H3>

<P>
Last August the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance requiring
&quot;any food product that is or contains material that has been
genetically engineered through such techniques as recombinant
DNA, cell fusion, or somoclonal variation&quot; to bear the label:
&quot;This food is genetically engineered.&quot; It was rescinded
in November after a coalition of food and biotechnology industry
representatives told the aldermen that their definition of genetically
engineered foods could have included as much as 80 percent of
the cheese sold in Chicago, and many soft drinks and baked goods.
Aldermen who had supported the ordinance cited the desire of their
constituents to know when a product has been genetically altered.
This debate about the definition of genetically engineered foods
and labeling is becoming more common as individuals and groups
seek to alert the public about food production methods. <BR>

<A NAME="purpose"></A><H3>OUR PURPOSE:</H3>

Sustainable agriculture has been defined as economically viable,

ecologically sound, and socially responsible.  California

agriculture is moving in this direction in response to demands from

the public, changing regulatory and environmental conditions,

economic incentives, and other forces.<BR>

<EM>For a more detailed description of sustainable agriculture, see our

pamphlet, </EM> <A HREF="/SAREP/Concept.html"><CITE> What is Sustainable 

Agriculture?</CITE></A><P>



The University of California created the UC Sustainable Agriculture

Research and Education Program in 1986 at the request of the

legislature (SB872, Petris).  We gather and distribute information

about issues and practices in sustainable agriculture, especially

in California; fund competitive research and education grants; and

establish sites for long-term research.<P>

  

SAREP works with UC faculty and Cooperative Extension personnel as

well as other interested groups.

<H4><IMG ALT=" " SRC="/images/sprout.gif">Competitive Grants</H4>

Since 1987 SAREP has funded 130 research projects for approximately

$2.5 million. In the 1994-95 funding cycle SAREP is granting a total of

$149,681 to 34 research and education projects.  You will find brief

descriptions of <A HREF="/SAREP/Grants/">this year's

A primary function of the program is to provide funding for sustainable
agriculture-
related  research and education projects.  SAREP has awarded over $2
million in 
competitive grant monies over the past seven years (FY 1986/87 - FY
1992/93).  In FY 
1991/92 and FY 1992/93, SAREP provided over $440,000 in new and
continuing 
competitive grants.

To facilitate the transition to sustainable agriculture, farmers need
accurate 
information about the benefits, costs, and risks associated with
"conventional" and 
"alternative" systems.  To generate this information, research must
eventually be 
conducted at the whole-farm level.  By broadening the boundaries of
investigation, 
researchers are able to evaluate critically the success of farming
practices and 
their effects on the environment, as well as the special requirements
for adapting 
these practices to farms in various locations.<P>

The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and
quantify the  environmental and economic consequences of the transition
from conventional to low-
input and organic farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento
Valley.  The 
research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC
farm advisors 
play a key role in guiding the management decisions applied to the
various production 
systems.  The project was initiated in 1989 and is located on the UC
Davis Agronomy 
Farm.

Since 1990, SAREP has added an emphasis in economic, social, and public
policy 
research.  Proposals have addressed the links among sustainable
agriculture 
and public policy; labor policies and practices; land use; rural
community 
development; decision-making and the transition to sustainable
agriculture; 
and consumers and the food system.

Seasonal employment is considered a fact of life for California's
farm  workers, but a SAREP-sponsored study concludes that extended and
year-round

This study compares the economic benefits, energy costs, and social
values of 
different vegetable production farming practices at the Rural
Development 
Center (RDC) in Salinas, California.  Farmers at the RDC are
predominantly 
Mexican farm laborers enrolled in a three-year production and marketing

training program in which low-input production practices are
emphasized.  The 
effect of these alternative practices on the short- and long-term
well-being 
of the enrolled families and the surrounding rural community will be 
determined and analyzed based on information from the field,
interviews, and 
workshops.<P>

Santa Cruz.<P>

This project has formed a diverse coalition of community members to
address 
important agricultural issues in Santa Cruz County. Agriculture is a
$196 
million dollar industry in the county, second only to tourism.  It is 
threatened by urban growth and development, groundwater depletion, and
the 
movement of agricultural operations to other countries where costs are
lower.  
The community-based coalition will work with UC Santa Cruz to pool
resources, 
expertise, and political strength to assess needs, devise solutions,
and 
implement strategies for change.  The project also aims to improve 
agriculture's environmental responsibility and economic strength,
increase its 
responsiveness to the needs of those who work within the industry as
well as 
to local communities, and strengthen its links to the local community.

<STRONG>Valerie Pelto,</STRONG> Alameda County Food Planning
Council.<P>

This project has developed a survey identifying the logistical,
economic, 
social, and regulatory barriers to bringing sustainably produced food
into 
Alameda County's food marketplace (in this project, sustainably
produced food 
refers to food that is locally grown and/or low-input or organically
grown).  
An advisory task force including wholesale and retail merchants, trade 
association members, consumers, and environmentalists was assembled in
the 
spring of 1992 to determine concerns of the food community about
barriers to 
the movement of sustainably produced food.  Surveys were developed to
collect 
baseline data regarding decision-making and buying criteria of retail
produce 
buyers, and to identify logistical, market, educational, or public
policy 
strategies to increase the availability of sustainably produced food in
the 
urban marketplace.<P>

director, 
Humboldt and Del Norte counties.<P>

This project organized five workshops throughout Humboldt and Del Norte

counties to address the topic of sustainable forestry management
options for 
small landowners.  The goal of sustainable forestry is shared by forest

landowners, legislators, and the public, yet is often difficult to
define and 
achieve.  Major changes in policies for the management of California's
14.4 
million acres of private forest land are evident in new and proposed 
legislation. Past laws and regulations that influenced cutting
practices, 
combined with natural events including fire and flood, have resulted in
many 
forest lands in need of restoration and improvement.  The costs of 
restoration, plus the costs imposed by legislative restrictions often 
discourage small landowners from long-term planning.  The workshops
looked at 
current legislation and policy instruments for implementing sustainable

forestry.  A dialogue between landowners, regulators, and legislators
was 
encouraged.<P>

This study examines the interaction of agricultural variables and rural

community conditions in 75 communities in the Central Valley of
California.  
The following hypotheses will be tested:

<UL>
	<LI>Larger farms are associated with lower quality of community
life.
	<LI>Separation of farm management from ownership is associated with
lower 
quality of community life.
	<LI>Crop diversity is associated with higher quality of community
life.
	<LI>The rate of pesticide permit applications is negatively
associated with 
quality of community life.
</UL>

The California Institute for Rural Studies will provide very recent 
agricultural data on farm size, cropping patterns, residency of farm
managers, 
and pesticide permit applications which will be organized by zip codes.
 The 
availability of this data will allow a much closer focus on
agricultural 
issues than was previously possible.  On the social variables, the
project 
will continue to improve measures of community quality especially in
the area 
of ethnic relations (e.g., availability of quality schooling for
minority 
children, income differentials between white and non-white holders of
the same 
occupational positions, etc.).  In addition, the project will continue
to run 
the full battery of standard tests of community life quality: family
income 
levels, employment rates, and poverty index.  These two data sets will
then be 
merged to find out which agricultural variables significantly affect
the 
social variables in these 80 communities.<P>

These projects are characterized as basic or applied research on a
problem 
that is critical to the sustainable functioning of a particular system.
 
Projects must clearly demonstrate how the component in question is
critical to 
the system being studied, and how the results of the work will be
integrated 
into the whole production system.  Preference has been given to
projects that 
demonstrate involvement of farmers in the identification of the
research 
problem and potential solutions, and those that have a clear plan for 
implementation of research results.<P>

Plowdown,

<STRONG>Michael Costello</STRONG>, Division of Biological 
Control, Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier.<P>

The variegated leafhopper is the most important insect pest in the
vineyards 
of central California.  Most growers have relied on synthetic
insecticides to 
control this pest.  However, pesticide resistance and outbreaks of
secondary 
pests are creating the need for more sustainable approaches.  Most of
the work 
on biological control of leafhoppers has focused on Anagrus epos, a
tiny 
insect that parasitizes leafhopper eggs.  Little information has been 
developed on the complex of generalist leafhopper predators in
vineyards.  
Three types of predators were previously found to be common in
vineyards that 
had low leafhopper densities: spiders, predatory flies, and predaceous
mites.  
This project will better determine the role of these predators.<P>

An increasingly popular method for providing a suitable habitat within
the 
vineyard to maintain high populations of these predators is through the
use of 
cover crops.  However, little is known about the effects of cover crops
on 
natural enemies at specific times during the grape growing season. 
Therefore, 
this project will also determine if there are specific windows in time
in 
which the presence of a cover crop is critical.<P>

Another aspect of this project will be to determine if the type of
trellis 
system affects the population densities of the three predator groups
noted 
above.  Informal observation indicates that single-wire systems may be 
advantageous to certain spider species, while multiple-wire systems may

support others.  Finally, the trellis system and/or the presence of
cover 
crops alters the vineyard microclimate, possibly affecting the ability
of 
predators to survive.  Temperatures will be monitored in an attempt to 
establish a relationship between predator populations and
temperature.<P>

Cover crops in the pea family can be plowed under as green manure to
supply 
nitrogen to a wide range of crops.  Organic farmers commonly use this 
technique, but vegetables present some challenges.  For example, bell
pepper 
has a long growing season and a high demand for nitrogen, yet is
shallow 
rooted.  Thus, the timing of nitrate produced by the breakdown of cover
crop 
residues is important, so that growers can determine the need for
possible 
late-season nitrogen supplements. <P> 

This study will use a randomized complete block design to monitor bell
pepper 
production following incorporation of a Lana woollypod vetch cover
crop, with 
five levels of late-season nitrogen addition.  The nitrogen source will
be an 
approved organic material, and plots of one of the experimental
treatments 
will receive no supplemental nitrogen.  The researchers will use
innovative 
techniques to monitor nitrate in both the soil and the foliage of the
pepper 
plants.<P>

<H3><A NAME="DairyDebate">The Dairy Debate Stack</A></H3>
The Dairy Debate Stack considers the implications of the use of
recombinant bovine 
growth hormone (BGH) by the dairy industry, and
rotational grazing, for animal
 health, consumers, the environment, farm
economics, and rural communities.    
Its purpose is to broaden and
inform the public debate over dairy technology 
and food safety.<P>

The Dairy Debate is a stand-alone application stack for 
the Apple
Macintosh computer. It  does not require Hypercard to run. It will 
run
with either System v. 6.0.7 or System 7. It is stored here as a BinHexed,

Project Description</A></H3>

The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and quantify the 
environmental and economic consequences of the transition from conventional to low-
input and organic farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento Valley.  The 
research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC farm advisors 
play a key role in guiding the management decisions applied to the various production 
systems.  The project was initiated in 1989 and is located on the UC Davis Agronomy 
Farm.

<H3><IMG SRC="../../images/compare.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<A NAME="Rotations">Rotations and Experimental Design</A></H3>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to the top of the page.	</A><P>

The main experiment occupies about 20 acres and compares four cropping systems:
 
<OL>
	<LI> a conventional two-year rotation; 
	<LI> a conventional four-year rotation; 
	<LI> a low-input four-year rotation; and 
	<LI> an organic four-year rotation.  
</OL>

The four systems are 
arranged in plots with four replicates of each system.  All the cropping systems 
include processing tomatoes, a high-value commodity grown on approximately 310,000 
acres in California (1990 data).  Other cash crops grown include wheat, safflower, 
field corn, and beans.  In addition, winter-spring cover crops are grown in the low-
input and organic systems.  The specific rotations used in the different management 
systems are shown below. <P>

<H3>Summary of Crop Rotations Used in Four Management Systems.</H3>

</PRE>

** Cover crops used have included vetch, oats, and cowpeas, solely or in mixtures.  Other species 
are currently being evaluated. <P>


Both conventional systems are managed using practices typical for the southern 
Sacramento Valley.  The two-year conventional system is practiced by farmers when 
short-term profit must be maximized.  The low-input system includes a winter 
cover crop prior to planting of tomatoes, safflower, corn, and beans.  While trying 
to reduce dependency on non-renewable resources, synthetic fertilizers or pesticides 
may be used in the low-input system to maintain the profitability of the operation.  
The organic system is managed according to the certification requirements of 
California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).  Only approved fertilizers and 
pesticides are used.  "Best farmer" management practices are used in all systems.  
For example, insect and disease management decisions for all systems are based on 
periodic monitoring of pest levels and no pesticides are applied until economic 
threshold levels are exceeded.<P>

A companion research area of eight acres is being used to test alternative grain and 
cover crop legumes that could be used as cash crops, as winter and summer cover 
crops, or in intercropping systems in California.  Along with this effort, 
investigators are evaluating various kinds of agricultural equipment for use in 
reduced tillage operations and innovative cover crop management. <P>


<H3><IMG SRC="../../images/compare.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> 
<A NAME="Observations">Preliminary Observations</A></H3>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to the top of the page.	</A><P>

Data collected during the first four years of the experiment include 
measurements of:  crop growth, yield, and quality; soil biology; soil 
fertility; soil organic matter levels; soil water infiltration rates; weed 
biomass; disease levels; pest and beneficial insect populations; and economic 
performance.  From these data, researchers have been able to make preliminary 
observations about the performance of the various cropping systems.<P>
     
Soil fertility and weed management have been identified as the most important 
factors limiting yields in the organic and low-input systems.  Researchers 
have altered production practices to address these constraints.  Organic and 
low-input tomatoes, for example, are now transplanted instead of direct-
seeded.  This practice gives tomatoes a head start in competing against weeds 
and allows for the use of more efficient mechanical cultivation techniques.  
Supplemental manure fertilizers have also improved yields in the organic and 
low-input systems.<P>

Other problems thus far have not been a major constraint for any of the 
production systems.  However, the soil-borne pathogen Verticillium dahliae has 
been consistently higher in the conventional two-year system than in the 
others.  Researchers will be collecting additional data to determine whether 
the disease organism will actually decrease tomato yields in this
rotation.  <P>

Organic matter added through cover cropping and manuring has resulted in small 
increases in soil organic matter levels in the organic and low-input plots.  
This increase seems to be improving soil physical structure as shown by trends 
toward increased water infiltration rates.  <P>

Preliminary results suggest that similar crop yields may be obtained when 
"best farmer" management practices are used in each of the different systems.  
Similar yields, however, do not necessarily translate into similar profits.  
Year-to-year variations in production costs for each system, and the modest 
price premiums offered for organically-grown commodities should also be 
considered.  During the 1991 growing season, for example, gross returns, per 
acre operating costs, and net returns above total costs were all highest in 
the conventional two-year rotation (all crops combined).  The 1992 season, by 
contrast, showed that the organic system had the highest figures in each of 
these same categories.  Results of this study support what other studies have 
found:  The transition period (as evidenced by the performance of the low-
input system) carries significant risk. There are no price premiums for 
"transitional commodities," costs of production may be high, growers are 
generally on the steep part of the learning curve, and the new production 
system can be ecologically unstable for a time.  Recommendations for 
minimizing this risk are a key objective as experimentation and analysis 
continue. <P>

Differences between the four cropping systems and the relationships among 
various parameters observed during the first four years of the experiment have 
suggested a number of more specific research questions to pursue.  These are 
listed below under the general headings of soil, pests, and economics:  


<H4>SOIL</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>	How do seasonal changes in nitrogen availability differ among the
various farming systems?   
  <LI>	What is the role of microbial biomass in regulating seasonal nitrate pool levels?
  <LI>	How do microbivorous nematodes affect nutrient cycling?
  <LI>	Can soil microbial parameters be used as indices of soil health?  
  <LI>	How will differences in soil organic matter levels and water infiltration rates affect the volume of 
soil explored by roots and the 
water balance of crops?
</UL>

<H4>PESTS</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>	Will soil-borne pathogens limit yields of tomatoes under the intensive 
two-year tomato-wheat rotation?
  <LI>	What levels of weed pressure can be tolerated in the different systems 
without loss of yield?
</UL>

<H4>ECONOMICS</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>	How do the costs of cover cropping and manuring compare to those of 
applying chemical fertilizer?
  <LI>	What are the cost differences and relative efficacy of conventional and 
alternative weed management strategies? 
</UL>

production practices and marketing for entry level farmers.  <B>Beatriz
Cabezon, </B>a<B> </B>graduate student from Argentina with experience
in agronomy and Spanish translation, is contacting farm advisors,
university programs, and non-profit organizations throughout the
state to gather existing Spanish language sustainable agriculture
information.  These materials will be evaluated by a review committee
for usefulness, content and readability and catalogued (with abstracts
in English and Spanish) in a database.  They will be publicized

<H1>From the Director: Internet: Advantages for Agriculture</H1>

<P>Long before most people had heard of networking computers together and
fewer still had heard of the Internet, a computer company began using the
marketing slogan &quot;the network is the computer.&quot; The slogan is
correct. The power of a computer lies not within its ability to balance
a checkbook or play a computer game, rather it lies within the speed and
the ease with which it provides access to useful information. Computer
networks allow information to flow more freely, with fewer obstructions.
Networking flattens hierarchies by allowing those looking for information
to go directly to many sources of information, bypassing traditional filtering
mechanisms or &quot;gatekeepers&quot; like educational institutions and
the media. It allows all kinds of people to contribute to the information
flowfarmers and other practi-tioners, researchers, consumers and policymakers.
Information can come directly from the sourcefrom a farmer who has used
crimson clover as a cover crop in his or her field, to the researcher who
has published a 7,000 word paper on nitrogen-fixing bacteria. </P>

<P>The global network of computers linked together called the Internet
is revolutionizing the way we receive information. The Internet is an example
of the power that can exist when computers are linked together. The exponential
growth of the Internet has far exceeded even the early estimates of sloganeering
computer companies. The network is the computer, but more importantly the
network is access to information. By some estimates, the number of computers
linked in the Internet exceeds ten million and spans dozens of countries.
That number has doubled in size in the last two years. The size of the
information base is unfathomable. </P>

<P>The Internet is still in its infancy, yet it contains more current information
than any other information source. For those who are linked to it already,
it can be easy to use, and the information accessible within it is available
24 hours a day, seven days a week. The tools for finding what you want
in the growing body of information are still imperfect, and it takes time
and money to learn how to use it. </P>

<P>When most people talk about the Internet they are referring to the World
Wide Web. The Web is the most popular medium on the Internet (others include
electronic mail and the Gopher information system). Because it offers so
much information and is relatively easy to use, it has been the driving
force behind the Internet's growth. The Web allows users to quickly visit
sites around the world simply by clicking on links embedded in the text.
Pictures, movies, sounds, and libraries of text can be accessed online.
</P>

<P>SAREP joined this vast information system more than a year ago. Our
site(<A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu</A>),
which recently won a bronze award from the national Council for Advancement
and Support for Education (CASE), has been visited by individuals residing
in more than 50 countries around the globe and thousands of people within
California. The Web has allowed us to distribute sustainable agriculture
information faster and more effectively than by any traditional media outlet.
A good example is this newsletter. Before it reaches your mailbox , it
is available online, along with most of our back issues of Sustainable
Agriculture. We are able to distribute all of our free publications, Requests
for Proposals, SAREP-funded project summaries, and calendar items related
to sustainable agriculture faster and easier than by mailing paper copies
of this information to individuals. We also have the potential to reach
more people. Additionally, by linking our databases to the Web we are able
to allow access to large amounts of information that could previously only
be distributed on disk. Our cover crop database is linked to the Web in
a way that is not possible with written materials, slide shows, or videos.
The information is completely current and searchable. As soon as a SAREP
staff member makes a change or update to the database the information is
immediately and automatically available online to Internet users. </P>

<P>Visitors to our site and the thousands of other sites on the Internet
are the real winners, however. Information is available online that previously
wouldn't have been available. A journal editor, for example, may decide
that a research paper will be pulled from the next issue because of space
constraints. The paper, however, may be posted online by its author, in
its entirety, plus photographs, charts and references that would never
have been published in the paper-based journal. Another and maybe more
significant advantage to Internet users is the fact that many Web sites
index and provide a searching mechanism for all the information on their
site. For example, our newsletters are indexed and searchable so visitors
can quickly find the information they are looking for without having to
scan through multiple issues. They can also find many other related information
sources (i.e. papers, studies, project summaries) that may further assist
them in their research. </P>

<P>The World Wide Web is becoming easier to use, but it is still evolving.
New users often get frustrated when first attempting to access information
online. New terminology and conventions can be overwhelming. Technologies
are still being developed to assist in access and management of information
on this dynamic medium. However, the Web currently offers enough information
useful to farmers, researchers, policymakers and consumer for us to encourage
you to experience the information available.</P>

<H1>Ferrari Farm: Successful Transition Agriculture in Linden
</H1>
<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Ferrari Farm, a highly diversified farm near Linden, San Joaquin
County, attracted 65 people to a farm tour and field day sponsored
by the Committee for Sustainable Agriculture Aug.22, 1990.  The
223 acre farm includes 75 acres of fruit trees, 126 acres of nuts,
and 22 acres of fresh market vegetables.  A total of 136 acres
are certified by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).
 Ferrari employs 12 to 14 people all year, and twice that number
during picking and packing seasons.  The Ferrari farm was selected
as a case study in<B> Alternative Agriculture</B> (National Research
Council, 1989).<BR>
<P>
<B>Wayne Ferrari</B> discussed his farm management with tour participants.
 &quot;Over the years, we have tried a lot of things and we have
made many mistakes, but it is an ongoing process to keep on top
of the operation,&quot; he said.<BR>
<H3>Marketing Key</H3>
<P>
Ferrari noted that the success of the operation has been largely
due to the diversity of crops, the price premiums obtained for
organic produce, and the fact that they market produce themselves.
 &quot;My dad always said, 'If we can grow it ourselves, we can
sell it ourselves.'&quot;  Ferrari said much of the produce is
sold to wholesale firms, and a significant amount is sold at the
San Francisco farmers' market.  The Ferraris have been selling
produce in the San Francisco Bay Area for about 30 years, and
have an established reputation and numerous repeat customers,
he said.<BR>
<P>
To maintain soil fertility on the organic acreage, Ferrari said
he uses a cover crop of purple vetch to supply nitrogen and add
organic matter to the soil.  In addition, nearly three tons per
acre of composted steer manure are used; in 1990 more than 450
tons were applied on the farm.
<H3>Pest Control</H3>
<P>
Ferrari also discussed insect pest management in his organic apple
orchard.  He is involved in the experimental use of the granulosis
virus to control codling moth larvae.  He said that one drawback
to its use is the number of sprays required per season - he had
just applied his 12th spray (four sprays per generation).  Scheduling
irrigations around sprays is difficult, Ferrari said.  He noted
that an advantage of the virus is that it is nontoxic and can
be used right up to the day of harvest.  It could be useful as
the final spray in a conventional spray program because no post
-application interval before harvest would be required, as is
the case with most chemical insecticides.  Ferrari has had excellent
success controlling oriental fruit moth on peaches using a mating
disruption technique.  A synthetic female insect sex pheromone
(scent) is released from dispensers, confusing the males and preventing
mating.  &quot;Many of our pest management problems will be solved
when the pheromone disruption technique is perfected for codling
moth and peach twig borer,&quot; he said.<BR>
<P>
&quot;But the most difficult pest management problem to overcome
in the organic acreage is the lack of fungicides,&quot; Ferrari
said.  He has had a major brown rot problem, as the only organically-acceptable
fungicides available are calcium sulfate and lime sulfur, which
did not provide adequate control.
<H3>Researchers Present</H3>
<P>
The afternoon portion of the field day included presentations
of sustainable agriculture techniques used by Ferrari and other
growers.  Of particular interest was &quot;Alternative Agricultural
Methods for Controlling Codling Moth.&quot;   <B>Lou Falcon</B>,
professor and insect pathologist, UC Berkeley Entomology Department,
discussed the use and status of the granulosis virus, which is
currently in the testing phase (see article in SAREP technical
newsletter <B>Components</B>, Vol.1, No.4, Fall 1990).<BR>
<P>
A review of codling moth mating disruption was presented by <B>Phil
Kirsch</B>, general manager and entomologist, Biocontrol Limited,
Davis.  Kirsch has worked on codling moth mating disruption studies
since 1987.  In field trials performed in Sutter, El Dorado, and
Lake counties, codling moth damage in pears was held to one percent
or less using mating disruption compared to 30 percent or more
for untreated trees, Kirsch said.  He said that 400 pheromone
dispensers per acre used two times per season was found to be
the most effective application rate.  The cost of using mating
disruption is similar to a conventional spray program, about $100-120
per acre, according to Kirsch.  He noted that the dispensers should
be commercially available for the 1991 season, pending EPA approval.

<H1>USDA's Sustainable Ag Conference Call<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Auburn</A>, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Team held its third quarterly
telephone conference call on May 5, 1992. The conference calls
are designed to share information between the USDA staff in Washington
and people in the states.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Jim Bushnell, </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">the leader
of the team from the Extension Service, described the $3 million
earmarked for new sustainable agriculture activities in the President's
budget for the USDA. Both Bushnell and <B>Ferd Hoefner</B>, Washington
representative for a coalition of sustainable agriculture nonprofit
organizations, expressed hope that the final figure might be even
higher. The funds are expected to be used for Chapters 2 (Integrated
Management Systems) and/or 3 (Education and Training) of the sustainable
agriculture section of the l990 Farm Bill, each of which is authorized
for up to $20 million in funding but has received no funding to
date.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>George Bird, </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Cooperative
State Research Service director of the national Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education (SARE) program (Chapter 1 of the same Farm
Bill), reported that the $6.725 million that the program currently
receives leverages approximately $l5 million more in matching
funds from grant recipients. The National Sustainable Agriculture
Advisory Council (NSAAC), appointed to advise the USDA on sustainable
agriculture, was scheduled to hold its first meeting June 9-11
in Omaha, Nebraska. Administrative changes in the program include
a change in the host institution for the Southern region SARE
program from Louisiana State University to a new (as yet unannounced)
site, and the appointment of a new director as Bird returns to
his nematology position at Michigan State University in September.
Despite the end of his two-year term as director, Bird will maintain
his involvement in sustainable agriculture with CSRS. Of particular
interest is the review of &quot;sustainable agriculture relevancy&quot;
of research beyond the SARE program (e.g. research conducted by
the Agricultural Research Service; research funded by the National
Research Initiative), stimulated by <B>Senator Thomas Daschle's</B>
hearings last September.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Jim Bushnell reported on the draft
guidelines being developed for the administration of Chapters
2 and 3, if they are funded. Chapter 3 includes regional training
centers for training extension workers and other agricultural
professionals, competitive grants for educational programs, and
technical guides and handbooks. The training center funds would
not be for &quot;mortar &amp; bricks,&quot; he emphasized, but
would involve faculty from universities and nonprofit organizations
throughout each region. Farmers and ranchers would be involved
as teachers, and their farms might be satellite centers for the
training. The ad-hoc group developing the guidelines will be seeking
input over the coming months.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The conference call concluded
with brief reports from the participants in various states. </FONT><B>Teresa
Maurer </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">of Appropriate Technology
Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA, a non-profit information center
in Fayetteville, Arkansas) said that they are seeking nominations
for the second version of the SAN Directory of Expertise (see
</FONT><I>Resources, </I>page 9);contact ATTRA at 1-8O0-346-9140
for more information. <B>Chuck Francis</B> of the University of
Nebraska described a binder of information available at cost ($35)
from the recent four-state (MI, IA, KS, NE) training on integrated
resource management, and other forthcoming publications.<B> Bill
Given </B>of the University of Georgia described the recent Southern
region meeting at Callaway Gardens (a tabloid summary and proceedings
are planned), and <B>David Granatstein </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">of
Washington State University announced plans for an October 2-26
meeting addressing issues of systems research and education.<B>
Greg</B> <B>Gajewski </B>of the Economic Research Service described
a data template they have developed for researchers to compile
information for their national model of the economic, environmental,
and social effects of sustainable agriculture.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">While most of the several dozen
participants in the May call were from universities, the quarterly
conference calls are open to any and all participants on a first-come,
first-serve basis. The dates and telephone number to call, along
with other timely information and dialogue about sustainable agriculture,
are shared through the computer electronic mail group &quot;sanet-mg,&quot;
accessible via the Internet computer network and the many commercial
and nonprofit networks that connect to it (e.g. Compuserve, MCI-Mail,

<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Barley produces a greater biomass and does it quicker than do the other cereals (Miller et al. 1989).  Days to maturity vary among varieties (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Barley (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name is <I>Hordeum vulgare</I></B> L. (Hitchcock, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Barley requires a mild winter climate and grows better in dry, cool climates than in hot, moist areas (Poehlman, 1985).  It is well adapted to high altitudes with cold, short seasons (McLeod, 1982).  The species possesses moderate resistance to cold (Madson, 1951), but winter barleys are less winter hardy than winter wheats, triticale or cereal ryes (Anderson and Reinbergs, 1985; Stoskopf, 1985).  A temperature of -8 degrees Centigrade or lower is required to kill seedlings of barley (Stoskopf, 1985).  Barley is also susceptible to damage by hot, dry weather that occurs during reproduction (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>In the North Coast region of Californa, barley can be sown in the fall (McLeod, 1982).  In general, it requires reseeding each fall (Finch & Sharp, 1983).  Seeding dates range from October - January (Madson, 1951).  Slayback (pers. comm.) suggests that winter varieties may be sown from September through February, and spring varieties from April-May.  Plant after November 1 to avoid warm temperatures if nematodes are a potential problem (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Barley can tolerate moderate droughts (McLeod, 1982; Poehlman, 1985) and is therefore superior to oat in semi-arid areas (McLeod, 1982).  Nonetheless, it is usually irrigated when grown as a cover crop (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Higher seeding rates of oat or barley may be appropriate where rainfall is heavy (Stoskopf, 1985), but low sowing densities do not necessarily lead to less water use because vegetative growth will be increased (Fukai et al., 1990). High-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture.  Weed populations were not reduced, but weed biomass was (Mohler and Liebman, 1987).  'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>This grass does well on well-drained, fertile loams or light, clay soils (Poehlman, 1985.); is best adapted to loam soils with good drainage (McLeod, 1982); and can tolerate loam to heavy soils (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Barley tolerates alkalinity, but does not grow well on very acid soils (McLeod, 1982), e.g., below pH 6.0 (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Barley has a low requirement for lime (McLeod, 1982).  Jobidon et al. (1989) tested barley, oat, and wheat-straw as mulches for black spruce (<I>Picea mariana</I></B>) seedlings in greenhouse trials. The mulches of barley and wheat enhanced foliar phosphorus content, but mulches did not affect mycorrhizal infection or growth of black spruce.  All mulches decreased manganese content of the seedlings, however.  'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Barley has the highest salt tolerance of all cereal crops (McLeod, 1982).  Many wild species of the genus <I>Hordeum</I></B> can also be found in saline habitats (von Bothmer and Jacobsen, 1985). Barley is used for reclamation of saline soils.  The main mechanisms of salinity tolerance are salt exclusion and salt dilution (Anderson and Reinbergs, 1985).  6-row, smooth-awned cultivars of barley are typically more salt tolerant than are 2-row, rough-awned cultivars (Hocket and Nilan, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seeding depth for barley or oat should be no greater than 5 cm (2 in).  Shallow seeding is possible in areas with high soil moisture and leads to more rapid emergence and lessened incidence of root rot disease (Stoskopf, 1985).  Other depths mentioned are 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982) and 2-6 cm (Baldridge et al., 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Barley grows faster in the winter and produces more vegetation than do reseeding annuals (Finch & Sharp, 1983).  Oat does not produce as much dry matter as barley, rye, or wheat (Miller, 1984). Dry matter yield was 2,570 lb/acre when cut May 9 from a stand seeded the previous fall (Hofstetter, 1988).  Dry-matter estimates by Williams and Doneen (1960) indicated 3100 lb/ac at boot stage, 5830 lb/ac at flowering, and 6760 lb/ac at medium dough stage.  In small plots, total dry matter at times of heading and mid grain-filling (kg/ha) for various barley cultivars was as follows: 'Corvette': 7,590, 11,980; 'Grimmett': 8,800, 10,100; 'Beecher': 8,250, 11,770; '2I Bon': 8,940, 10,630; 'Gus': 7,600, 9,250; 'Piroline': 9,900, 9,960; and 'Triumph': 11,000, 10,720 (Fukai et al., 1990).  Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) found that barley ('Cosina') produced 17.2 Mg/ha.  In Mendocino County, cv 'UC 476' produced 12.985+/-2.621 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.), and yielded the greatest biomass of all 32 cover crops assessed, which was statistically greater than the biomasses produced by 'Oregon Common' annual ryegrass, 'Blando' brome, or 'Zorro' fescue but not than oat or cereal rye (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Hofstetter (1988) wrote that nitrogen content is 3.5% and that there was up to 38 lb of N per acre.  Williams and Doneen (1960) estimated that total aboveground N content was 83 lb/ac at boot stage, 93 lb/ac at anthesis, and 81 lb/ac at medium dough stage. Jobidon et al.  (1989) tested barley-, oat-, and wheat-straw mulches in field trials in eastern Quebec forest plantations.  The mulches reduced soil nitrification, apparently through the production of five phenolic acids.  Growth rate and foliar nitrogen content were higher for black-spruce seedlings with mulches.  There were no other significant differences in nutrient status.<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) as catch crops following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina'): 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko'): 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex'): 22.9.  Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley: 20.3, rapeseed: 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley: 17.2, rapeseed: 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Barley can be cut for hay/haylage, or harvested for grain. (Hofstetter, 1988); it can be plowed in as green manure in spring (Hofstetter, 1988) or grown as a cover crop (McLeod, 1982).  It can be grazed lightly in winter or spring (Hofstetter, 1988).  Barley produces abundant biomass quicker than the other cereals and can be used prior to cash crops that are seeded in early spring (Madson, 1951); it can often be grown where other covercrops cannot (Miller et al., 1989).  In Central Valley vineyards, it can be matured before vine shoots emerge, thus lessening potential for frost injury (McKenry, pers. comm.).  Barley is used for reclamation of saline soils; the main mechanisms of salinity tolerance are salt exclusion and salt dilution (Anderson and Reinbergs, 1985).  Oat is usually preferred over barley as a companion crop (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina'): 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko'): 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex'): 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley: 20.3, rapeseed: 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley: 17.2, rapeseed: 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate.  However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>There are many varieties of barley from which to choose.  The National Seed Storage Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Fort Collins, Colorado, maintains seed for 25,284 landraces, cultivars, and wild species of barley. (Moseman and Smith, 1985). Twenty-four varieties are listed by the Southern Seedsman's Association (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Few varieties of barley or oat are adapted coast to coast (Stoskopf, 1985).  The choice should be based on climatic suitability (Slayback, pers. comm.).  The spring or North Africa type of barley is used in California (Poehlman, 1985).  Cultivated varieties of barley include 6-rowed and 2-rowed types.  In two-row types, all kernals are symmetrical, but in 6-row types, 2/3 are twisted, i.e., those from the lateral rows of the spike.  The lateral kernals are smaller and weigh 13-20% less. Kernal weight in barley ranges from 5 to 80 mg (Reid, 1985). Six-row varieties of barley do not necessarily produce low numbers of tillers, but tiller mortality is high when they produce many (Fukai et al., 1990).  Some barley varieties are susceptible to lodging at high sowing densities, e.g.  cv 'Beecher' (Fukai et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Barley seedlings are vigorous and excellent competitors against weeds (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Barley seed is usually available at low cost (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Cv 'UC 476' cost $0.15 per lb retail in 1993 (Fred Thomas, pers comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Many varieties are readily available (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Barley can grow up to 30 inches in height, but maximum height varies with cultivar (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Cv 'UC 476' attained a height of 94.62+/-6.17 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.) in Mendocino County (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Barley can be plowed in as green manure in spring (Hofstetter, 1988); its residue breaks down more slowly than that of cereal rye (Finch & Sharp, 1983).  It should be incorporated before April 1 to avoid warm temperatures if nematodes are likely to be a problem (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Barley is an annual with erect growth (Hitchcock, 1973). Tillering occurs at the base (Finch & Sharp, 1983); barley varieties usually have a greater ability to produce tillers than do oat varieties (Stoskopf, 1985), and there is moderate to heavy density of growth (Madson, 1951), barley and oat have the poorest resistance to lodging of the cereals (Stoskopf, 1985), but barley, oat, and rye do better in this respect than do 'Blando' brome or 'Zorro' fescue (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> <P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding rates are typically from 60-90 lb/acre (Madson, 1951; McLeod, 1982; Miller et al. 1989), with Finch & Sharp (1983) favoring the high rate and Hofstetter (1988) suggesting 100 lb/acre.  However, Baldridge et al. (1985.) recommend only 27 kg/ha.  High seeding rates may be appropriate where rainfall is heavy (Stoskopf, 1985).  Low sowing densities do not necessarily lead to less water use because vegetative growth will be increased (Fukai et al., 1990).  Some barley varieties are susceptible to lodging at high sowing densities, e.g. cv 'Beecher' (Fukai et al., 1990).<P> Intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B. hirta</I></B>) than was a dense monoculture of barley.  The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley) (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>McKenry (Cantisano, pers. comm.) stated that barley is host for a <I>Meloidogyne javania</I></B> race that is a problem on Thompson Seedless grapes and a minor host for <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B>. In problem areas, barley should be planted after November 1 and incorporated before April 1 to avoid the warm soil temperatures that favor nematode build-up.  Barley appears to be deleterious to population of <I>Protylenchus vulness</I></B>, but field tests are still needed.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Winter cover crops, including the annual grasses barley, 'Blando' brome, and cereal rye, and various annual clovers and medics, are suggested for Californian vineyards with the aim of producing a sod-like condition. Ideally, cover crops should be low growing, require little or no mowing, and be self re-seeding. Their functions should be to reduce tillage and dust, provide habitat for predators that attack spider mites, improve water penetration, and provide nitrogen (Christensen, 1971).<P> Liebman and Robichaux (1990) found that intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B.  hirta</I></B>) than was a dense monoculture of barley.  The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley).<P> Lutman and Dixon (1991) showed that volunteer barley could suppress the early growth of rape but that the rape compensated after barley had matured, and rape seed yields, although delayed, were little affected.<P> Barley is usually more competitive than oat, and for this reason, oat is usually preferred over barley as a companion crop (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> High-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture. Weed populations were not reduced, but biomass was (Mohler and Liebman, 1987).<P> In trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard), 'Century' variety of field pea performed well even with high soil nitrogen. The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P> Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by the weed common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Barley is not a legume and requires no inoculation with rhizobia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>To seed barley, use drills with disk or double-disk openers. Hoe- or furrow-type drills are used in arid regions with no irrigation (Baldridge et al., 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Days to heading (flowering) vary among barley cultivars.  Some examples include: 'Corvette': 84; 'Grimmett', 'Beecher', '2I Bon', and 'Gus': 97; 'Piroline': 104; and 'Triumph': 110 (Fukai et al., 1990).  Cv 'Proctor' appears to require about 90 days to flower (Wych et al., 1985).  According to Munz (1973), flowering of barley can range from April through July.  As with other cereal grains, mowing and irrigation can be used to postpone and prolong flowering of barley (Menke, J., pers. comm.).<P>

<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) grew three winter crops (barley, rapeseed, and Italian [annual] ryegrass) following faba bean (cv 'Alfred') in order to evaluate their abilities to accumulate residual nitrogen.  Accumulation of nitrogen was as follows (kg/ha): barley ('Cosina'): 36.2, rapeseed (cv 'Buko'): 52.1, and Italian [annual] ryegrass of Welsh origin (cv 'Deltex'): 22.9. Carbon/Nitrogen ratios were: barley: 20.3, rapeseed: 22.0, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 31.0.  Dry matter (biomass) accumulation was (tons/ha): barley: 17.2, rapeseed: 25.4, and Italian [annual] ryegrass: 14.8.  Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P> Williams (1966) found that increase in infiltration rate of irrigation water was inversely related to the nitrogen concentrations of nonleguminous green manures at the time of incorporation by disking.  Barley (<I>Hordeum vulgare</I></B> cv 'Atlas 40', cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B> cv 'Svalof Fourex'), annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B>), and soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I></B> cv 'Blando') significantly improved infiltration rate in a loamy, well-drained soil, but mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B>) did not.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>

Rapeseed was superior in retaining nitrogen that might otherwise be leached as nitrate. However, the residues of Brassicaceae such as rapeseed tend to break down and re-release N quicker than do those of grasses (Poaceae).<P> Barley can improve water infiltration rate in soil (Williams and Doneen, 1960).  Williams (1966) found that increase in infiltration rate of irrigation water was inversely related to the nitrogen concentrations of nonleguminous green manures at the time of incorporation by disking.  Barley (<I>Hordeum vulgare</I></B> cv 'Atlas 40', cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B> cv 'Svalof Fourex'), annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B>), and soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I></B> cv 'Blando') significantly improved infiltration rate in a loamy, well-drained soil, but mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B>) did not.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Barley is a an annual grass with culms erect, 60 to 120 cm tall; blades flat, mostly 5 to 15 mm wide, with the auricle well developed; spike erect or nearly so, 2 to 10 cm long, excluding awns; the three spikelets sessile; glumes divergent at base, narrow, nerveless, gradually passing into a stout awn; awn of lemma straight, erect, mostly 10 to 15 cm long (Hitchcock, 1973). Cultivated varieties of barley include 6-rowed and 2-rowed types. In two-row types, all kernals are symmetrical, but in 6-row types, 2/3 are twisted, i.e., those from the lateral rows of the spike. The lateral kernals are smaller and weigh 13-20% less. Kernal weight in barley ranges from 5 to 80 mg (Reid, 1985). Barley roots attain a depth of as much as 1.8-2.1 m on deep soils.  The deepest roots are of seminal origin, whereas the upper soil is usually explored by adventitious roots (Reid, 1985).  At common seeding rates, barley usually develops from one to six stems or tillers per plant (Reid, 1985). Barley (0.2% outcrossing) is mainly self-pollinated (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Barley has a strong, fibrous root system that aids in erosion control (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Roots attain a depth of as much as 1.8-2.1 m on deep soils; the deepest roots are of seminal origin, whereas the upper soil is usually explored by adventitious roots (Reid, 1985).  Roots of barley produce more total monosaccharides than do those of alfalfa (Angers and Mehuys, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>A temperature of -8 degrees Centigrade is required to kill seedlings of barley (Stoskopf, 1985).  Barley is easy to get establish even during cold weather (Miller et al., 1989), and seedlings have excellent vigor (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Of the cereals, barley and oat have the poorest resistance to lodging (Stoskopf, 1985).  Barley is usually more competitive than oat (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Barley is grown over a broader environmental range than any other cereal (Poehlman, 1985).  Archeological findings from the Nile Valley of Egypt suggest that barley has been cultivated for at least 18,000 years (von Bothmer and Jacobsen, 1985).  The two-rowed barleys probably originated in Asia in part from a species called <I>Hordeum spontaneum</I></B> Koch; the ancestor of the 6-row barleys is unknown (Hitchcock, 1973).  Few varieties of barley are adapted coast to coast (Stoskopf, 1985); geographic suitability will vary among varieties or cultivars (Slayback, pers. comm.).  In general the species does poorly in hot, humid climates (Poehlman, 1985). It is not persistent in the wild, but beardless barley occasionally occurs in grain fields and along roads from Connecticut to New Jersey, in South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado (Hitchcock, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seeding depth for barley or oat should be no greater than 5 cm (2 in). Shallow seeding is possible in areas with high soil moisture and leads to more rapid emergence and lessened incidence of root rot disease (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> To seed barley, use drills with disk or double-disk openers. Hoe- or furrow-type drills are used in arid regions with no irrigation (Baldridge et al., 1985).  Barley or oat is usually planted in rows 15 to 20 cm apart (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>

There were also control plots with no cover crops seeded.  The cover crops were planted in mid September and killed during early or late May with applications of the graminicidal herbicide fluazifop-butyl. All cover crops showed better weed suppression than the control, but the only significant differences among cover crops indicated that barley was inferior to rye or winter wheat.  There were no significant differences among treatments in yield of strawberries.<P> Jobidon et al.  (1989a) tested barley-, oat-, and wheat-straw mulches in eastern Quebec forest plantations of balsam fir/birch. The mulches inhibited red raspberry (<I>Rubus idaeus</I></B>) and reduced mean weed cover by 41%, apparently through the production of five phenolic acids.  Liebman (1989) found that high-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture.  Weed populations were not reduced but biomass was (Mohler and Liebman, 1987).  In trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard), 'Century' variety of field pea performed well even with high soil nitrogen. The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen.<P> Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by the weed common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).<P> Weed above-ground biomass (dry) in plots seeded to cv 'UC 476' in a Mendocino County vineyard on May 15-16 was 0.043+/-0430 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) which was less than 1% of the weed biomass recorded for the control plots.  Dominant winter annual weeds at the site were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  ;Vegetational cover by the barley was estimated as 87.50+/-6.61 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Barley is an annual cereal grass (McLeod, 1982).  In California, flowering is from April through July (Munz, 1973). Barley has a flexible reproductive system that mainly involves inbreeding (0.2% outcrossing (Stoskopf, 1985)), but has the potential for cross pollination (von Bothmer and Jacobsen, 1985). Barley varieties usually have a greater ability than oat varieties to produce tillers (Stoskopf, 1985).  Six-row varieties of barley do not necessarily produce low numbers of tillers, but tiller mortality is high when many are produced (Fukai et al., 1990)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Bird cherry - oat aphid (<I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B>) is an important pest of barley.  In Denmark, the economic injury level is 70% of stems infested, or about 7 aphids per stem (Hansen, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The following account is from Hitchcock (1971).  The spike is erect or nearly so, 2-10 cm long, excluding awns, the three spikelets sessile; glumes divergent at base, narrow, nerveless, gradually passing into a stout awn; awn of lemma straight, erect, mostly 10-15 long.  In the two-rowed barley varieties, the lateral spikelets are sterile; in the six-row forms, all the spikelets produce large seed.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Several barley varieties mature in early April, so probably suffer little from shading by deciduous orchard trees that leaf out late (e.g., pecan, walnut) or from grapes (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>According to Baldridge et al. (1985), Diallate, Triallate and Trifluralin are pre-emergence herbicides used to reduce incidence of wild oat in barley stands; barban can be used post emergence for the same purpose.  Barley shows good tolerance of 2,4-D and MCPA amine and ester formulations, Bromoxynil, Triallate, Difenzoquat, Trifluralin, Diclofop, and Chlorsulfuron.  Fair tolerance is observed for Diallate and Barban, and poor tolerance of Dicamba.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>In the U.S.A., mean grain yield from 1978-1980 was 2,684 kg/ha, with a total production of 8,680,000 tons, 5.2% of the world production (Poehlman, 1985). By contrast mean yield was 4,312 kg/ha in the Federal Republic of Germany (Poehlman, 1985). Under irrigation and with 336 kg N/ha added, barley seed yields can attain about 3,800 kg/ha (Baldridge et al., 1985).  Under dryland conditions, maximum yield was about 1,700 kg/ha with 112 kg N/ha added (Baldridge et al., 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Safe storage of seed requires that moisture content must be 14% or less; this may necessitate drying of seed prior to storage (Baldridge et al., 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>The following is based on the account by Baldridge et al. (1985).  Barley is usually harvested by direct combining or by swathing prior to combining. Barley is physiologically mature when kernal moisture declines to about 40%, but kernals are largest if harvested at 35%.  Storage should be at 14% moisture or lower. However, allowing barley to stand until the safe level is reached typically leads to shattering; shatter-resistant cultivars are especially important in the Southwest, where relative humidity can drop quickly following maturation.<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Barley straw contains nutrients in the following amounts (lbs/ton of hay) 4-6 of P2O5, 21-42 of  K2O, 2 of S, 8 of Ca, 2 of Mg, 0.008 of Cu, 0.26 of Mn, and 0.04 of Zn, and has a C/N ratio of 58 (Parnes, 1990).  Anger and Mehuys (1990) found that cropping with barley led to higher soil carbohydrate concentration than with alfalfa.  This may have been due to the greater root biomass of barley and its greater ratio of carbon to nitrogen, leading to slower decomposition of barley roots. Ansari (1990) found that for barley, increasing salinity led to decreasing Ca and K concentrations and increasing Na and P.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Poehlman's (1985) account indicated that the largest use of barley grain is as animal food, primarily to supply carbohydrates and protein.  As with other cereal grains, barley is deficient in the amino acid lysine and relatively high in the sulfur-bearing amino acids methionine and cystine.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Fermentation products of malted barley are well known to cause intoxication of workers (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>

<BR>
</I>
<P>
Some 250 farmers, fabric and garment 0 manufacturers, scientists,
agricultural consultants, entrepreneurs, and environmentalists
assembled in Visalia, California for the <I>Second Transitional
Organic Cotton Conference</I> September 7-8,1993. The meeting
reflected the high degree of vertical integration within the organic
cotton movement. The lead 0 organization was the California Institute
for Rural Studies, with financial support from fabric and garment
companies, an industry coalition and UC SAREP. The program included
over 40 speakers on topics including labor practices, marketing,
organic production and manufacturing techniques, and administrative
issues such as the transition to organic production, certification
and tracking processes. A fashion show featuring clothing made
of organic cotton was one of the conference highlights. <BR>

<P>
According to speaker <B>Melanie Moore</B> of the National Cotton
Council, more than 40,000 acres of certified organic cotton are
now grown in the U.S., representing about one percent of the national
crop. Organic acreage is projected to increase substantially in
the next three years, because many acres are currently in transition
to organic production. <BR>

<P>
<B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A></B>, SAREP, facilitated a press session, and the
&quot;Discussion of Sustainable Growing Practices.&quot; The press
session was run as a facilitated panel discussion, rather than
as a more typical &quot;free for all,&quot; with questions by
reporters prompting statements by, and exchanges among, resource
people. <BR>

<P>
SAREP staff in attendance were impressed by the excitement of
the conference, the unusually broad constituency represented,
and the alliances that were being forged. In these respects, the
event and the movement as a whole may serve as models for other
sustainable agricultural programs. Organizer <B>Will Allen</B>
of the California Institute for Rural Studies expressed overall
satisfaction with the conference. He noted that important agricultural
labor issues were highlighted by attorney <B>Bill Monning</B>
of Salinas, and merit additional attention at future cotton conferences.

<P>
California fared well in the second round of competitive grants
funded by the USDA's new Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA)
Program. <B>Bill Liebhardt</B> and <B>Jill Auburn</B> of UC SAREP,
UC Davis extension weed ecologist <B>Tom Lanini</B>, and Oregon
State University's <B>Alan Cooper</B> received $90,000 to develop
information on cover crops. Funds will be used for regional  meetings,
 databases,  publications,  and videotapes.<BR>
<P>
<B>Ron Voss</B>, director of UC's Small Farm Program and a UC
Davis vegetable crops extension specialist, is heading a five-state
project with more than a dozen investigators. The project received
$112,000 to collect and disseminate information on a range of
topics including farm diversification, specialty crops, marketing,
sustainable organic practices, and education methods.<BR>
<P>
A farming systems comparison study involving a team of UC Davis
researchers was awarded $174,311.  The project is comparing conventional,
low-input and organic systems and is headed by entomologists <B>Ted
Wilson</B> and <B>Mike Hoffman</B>, and agronomist <B>Steve Temple</B>.
(For more information on the project see <B>Sustainable Agriculture
News</B>, volume 2, no.1, page 6.)<BR>
<P>
A comparison of low and high-input vegetable production systems
in California, awarded $215,300 in LISA funds in 1988 for two
years, is well underway. Fourteen farms growing fresh-market tomatoes
in Yolo, Sutter, and Sacramento  counties  are  being intensively
monitored for their soil, plant, water, pathology, and insect
effects by <B>Laurie Drinkwater</B> and <B>Carol Shennan</B> of
UC Davis' vegetable crops department, UC Davis plant pathologist
<B>Ariena van Bruggen</B>, UC Santa Cruz ecologist <B>Deborah
Letourneau</B>, and <B>Phil LeVeen</B>, an independent economist.
<BR>
<P>
Projects funded in other states in the Western Region are also
of interest to California producers. <B>Nancy CalIan</B> and <B>Don
Mathre</B> of Montana State University received a grant to study
an alternative to chemical control of &quot;damping-off,&quot;
a seedling disease in vegetables. In their initial trials, seeds
coated with a particular strain of <I>Pseudomonas </I>bacteria
provided equal or better control of damping-off than did chemical
treatment when seeds were planted into cold soil.<BR>
<P>
<B>Linda Hardesty</B> at Washington State University is joining
a commercial grower in studying a &quot;silvopastoral&quot; system
in which sheep graze in a fruit orchard. <BR>

<P>
The release of our three-year progress report (see box below)
is an opportunity to review and assess where we've been, and where
we're going. Highlights of the past three years include: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>  Establishment of competitive grants in economics and public
policy. Ten grants address a range of topics including strategies
for employing year-round labor, sustainable forestry management,
agricultural ethics curriculum, community supported agriculture
and pesticide reduction policies. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  Establishment of competitive grants for meetings and other
educational events (see p.7) and for graduate student awards (1993-94
awards will be announced later this month). 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  Continued strength in competitive grants for systems research,
critical component research, and monitoring innovative producers
(see p.6) 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  Release of informational and educational materials including
a 372-page comprehensive analysis of the biological, economic
and social consequences of two dairy technologies (bovine growth
hormone and rotational grazing); practical booklets on organic
soil amendments and on citrus production; and videos on soil management,
weed management, and cover crop management in annual and perennial
crops (see <I>Resources</I> p. 14). 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  Leadership in the development of the Sustainable Agriculture
Network, a national system for sharing printed and computerized
information. (see p.4) 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
At the time of this writing, we are planning for the next meeting
of our public and technical advisory committees, who will help
us set priorities for next year's competitive grants, and shape
other program priorities. We are also looking ahead to the return
of director <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B> from his sabbatical leave. His
experiences teaching extension agents in Vermont, observing agricultural
policies in New Zealand, and studying the systems approach used
at Hawkesbury College in Australia will give us many creative
ideas for our own future. Please order a copy of our free <I>Progress
Report</I>, let us know what you think about our past efforts,
and share with us your own creative ideas and vision for sustainable
agriculture in California.-<I><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>, associate director,

<H1>A New Look: SAREP Newsletters Will Merge</H1>
<P>
Beginning with the Fall 1992 issue, <I>Sustainable Agriculture
News, </I>SAREP's general newsletter will merge with <I>Components,
</I>the program's journal of technical notes and reviews.  The
new publication will be called
<P>
<CENTER><B>Sustainable Agriculture<BR>
<B>News and Technical Reviews from the<BR>
<B>University of California Sustainable Agriculture<BR>
<B>Research and Education Program<BR>
</B></B></B></B></CENTER>
<P>
It will feature news and announcements related to sustainable
agriculture in California, practical information for farmers and
ranchers, as well as technical/research summaries formerly featured
in <I>Components.<BR>
</I>
<P>
We believe this change will allow us to reduce publishing costs,
present a mix of articles to relieve reader fatigue, alleviate
redundancy of some articles, and eliminate readers' confusion
over two newsletters.<BR>
<P>
Subscriptions will automatically be transferred to the new quarterly
starting with the fall issue, Volume 5, No, 1.  There will be
five issues the first &quot;year,&quot; then four issues per year
starting with Volume 6, No.1 in January 1994.  For questions or
comments about this change, please contact one of our editors,

<H1>Birds of Prey Assist Farmers</H1>
<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Farmers seeking to reduce or eliminate are often frustrated inability
to control vertebrate pests.  Preventive strategies, such controlling
vegetation around orchard tree trunks and field borders, can help
with meadow mice and gopher control.  Common non-chemical methods
include shooting, trapping, and flooding.  While these methods
can be very effective, they are not without limitations; flooding
is not always possible, and trapping and shooting can be very
time-consuming and impractical where large areas are infested.
<BR>
<P>
Birds of prey can contribute to vertebrate pest management, especially
in fields located near riparian areas.  While raptors are seldom
relied upon as the primary means of vertebrate control, they can,
with a little help, be more effective than many people think.
 This article explores the effectiveness of owls and hawks in
vertebrate pest management and techniques for enhancing their
populations.<BR>
<H3><B>Barn Owls</B></H3>
<P>
There are many different species of owls, but the barn owl (<I>Tyto
alba</I>)<I> </I>is the most helpful to farmers.  It is often
called &quot;the most beneficial bird in the world&quot; because
of its hearty appetite for gophers, ground squirrels, and meadow
mice.  Farmers who have learned of the barn owl's virtues strive
to keep this &quot;cat with wings&quot; in close proximity to
crops.  One nest of six young barn owls and two adults may consume
more than 1,000 small mammals during the nesting season.<BR>
<P>
Because of their high first-year mortality, short life-span (four
years maximum), and dependence upon the fluctuating nature of
rodent populations, barn owls have developed a tremendous reproductive
capability in order to survive.  They are often referred to as
&quot;reproductive machines.&quot;  This capability functions
in response to availability of prey; they can quickly colonize
an area if suitable habitat (prey and nest sites) is available.
<BR>
<P>
Barn owls are strictly nocturnal hunters, having the remarkable
ability to see their prey in complete darkness.  They hunt from
perched or flying positions, and have been known to spot prey
from a distance of several hundred feet.  Barn owls routinely
fly one mile from their nests to hunt, and may venture up to three
miles or more.  Their preferred hunting sites are grassland and
wet meadow habitats, either with a few trees or in wooded areas.
<BR>
<P>
Barn owls do not build nests.  They lay eggs in hollow trees,
crevices in cliffs, and holes in sandbanks, and also find home
sites in abandoned buildings, granaries, or barns.  According
to many researchers and farmers, it is fairly easy to attract
barn owls to fields, orchards, or vineyards by constructing nest
boxes.<BR>
<H3><B>Grower Success</B></H3>
<P>
Merced County farm advisor <B>Lonnie Hendricks</B> reported that
several almond growers have drastically reduced gopher populations
in orchards by installing barn owl nest boxes.  One such grower,
<B>Bill Genn</B> of Hilmar, had orchards so badly infested with
gophers that his flood irrigation water often spilled onto neighbor's
land from gopher holes at the edge of  the orchard. Genn was advised
to install nesting boxes for owls in trees and on poles near the
orchard.  Owls now live in the boxes and Genn's gopher problems
have disappeared; rodent bones litter the ground under the boxes.
<BR>
<H3><B>Hawks</B></H3>
<P>
Hawks can also aid in vertebrate pest management.  Important species
include the red-tailed hawk <I>(Buteo jamaicensis), </I>and the
American Kestrel <I>(Falco sparverius), </I>also known as a small
falcon, sparrow hawk or kitty hawk.  Hawks eat meadow mice, small
birds, grasshoppers and other insects.  To encourage hawks, whose
presence also frightens starlings and other pest bird species,
some farmers install perches and nest boxes near their crops.
 Perches may be especially important in winter and early spring
to aid hawks in spotting food sources before the rodents' breeding
season, and when many crops are either absent or provide little
cover.<BR>
<H3><B>Kestrel Houses</B></H3>
<P>
Kestrels prefer to nest in dead trees and other crevices, but
also use secluded buildings and wood raptor houses.  Open fields,
meadows and fence rows are good locations for kestrel houses.
Houses can be mounted on utility poles, buildings, lone trees
or posts.  According to a Soil Conservation Service (SCS) bulletin,
the house can be made of long-lasting redwood or cedar, and should
be mounted 10 to 15 feet from the ground with the entrance clear
of branches. Because the house needs to be checked and cleaned
periodically, it should be erected where it can be reached.  Complete
kestrel house plans are available from SCS.  November through
January is the best time to build a kestrel house.  Houses should
be checked weekly in the spring to make sure starlings and other
pest birds are not using the box.  Kestrels bring no nesting material
into the house, so any material found in the box is from pest
birds and should be removed.  Kestrel eggs are white/cinnamon
colored with spots of brown and hatch in about 28 days.  Starling
eggs are pale blue. Screech owls, which may also use the boxes
and are desirable birds, have white eggs.  Kestrel houses should
face south or east, and should be located within 200 yards of
a tall tree or pole because the raptors like high perches nearby.
<BR>
<H3><B>Davis Survey</B></H3>
<P>
How effective are perches and nest boxes, and how effective are
hawks in vertebrate pest management?  The data is mixed; many
growers report success, yet others contend that avian predators
alone cannot keep populations of meadow mice low for extended
periods of time because predators leave the area when prey abundance
is low.  Surveys show mixed results of perch and box effectiveness.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Shawn Smallwood</B>, a researcher in the agronomy and range
science department at UC Davis, recently completed a two-year
survey of the use of perches by hawks.  His survey covered 200
miles in the Sacramento Valley, and included farms of all major
crops grown in the region.  He studied artificial perches, trees,
telephone poles, and fenceposts.<BR>
<P>
Smallwood found that most hawks avoid the smaller perches installed
by farmers (horizontal dowels or boards supported by posts or
metal pipes); only occasionally did he find a small hawk using
one of them.  Most hawks were found using telephone poles or vertically-oriented
&quot;snags&quot; on trees.  Hawks prefer large perches which
can comfortably hold their whole body, according to Smallwood.
 He also found that the height of a perch was not as important
to the raptors as the fact that it provided a broad view of the
surrounding land.  Large trees are ideal roosts, Smallwood reported,
but they function best as perches if the canopy is opened so raptors
can get a clear view.  Dead limbs sticking up above leaves are
used more than branches within the canopy.<BR>
<H3><B>Washington Study</B></H3>
<P>
Researchers in Washington state conducted a study examining the
use and effectiveness of artificial perches and nest boxes.  Three
orchards in the Wenatchee area were used in the study. Researchers
made direct observations and examined predator pellets.<BR>
<P>
In this study, none of the barn owl boxes and only 13 percent
of the kestrel boxes were inhabited. However, more birds were
attracted to the orchards where perches were placed than those
without perches.  The biomass and height of the understory vegetation
had no bearing on the use of perches in this study.  The effect
of raptors on meadow mice populations was unclear; populations
were reduced in one orchard only.  However, the level of human
activity may have played a major role.  Where houses and roads
were most heavily used, few birds visited the perches. Human activity
was minimal near the orchard in which raptor use of perches was
high and the mice population was reduced.<BR>
<H3><B>Other Studies</B></H3>
<P>
In an Oregon study, American kestrels and great-horned owls showed
a preference for 5-meter perches over 2.5-meter perches, but the
raptors accepted the shorter perches in the absence of taller
ones.  Barn owls did not show a height preference.<BR>
<P>
Pest bird activity in vineyards was not affected by the presence
of artificial perches, according to a Napa study.  Although four
hawk species were observed in the area, none was seen using the
artificial perches.  Pest birds were not deterred by hawk models
on some of the perches.

<H1>New Book Takes a Hard Look at Controversial Dairy Technology
</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, SAREP <BR>
</I>
<P>
A<I> </I>new book published by UC SAREP critically examines bovine
growth hormone (bGH), a controversial technology proposed for
use in the nation's dairy industry, and compares it to an alternative
technology for milk production called rotational grazing, a flexible
system of pasture management. <I>THE DAIRY DEBATE: Consequences
of Bovine Growth Hormone and Rotational Grazing Technologies </I>examines
the issues from the perspectives of veterinary, soil, agronomy,
forage and nutrition scientists, as well as economists and public
policy analysts. The 372-page book is edited by <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B>,
SAREP director. Individual chapters were written by two SAREP
analysts, two UC agricultural economists, an independent writer,
and four scientists from universities in Virginia, West Virginia
and Vermont.<BR>

<P>
 BGH is a synthetically produced version of a naturally occurring
cow hormone also called bovine somatotropin (bST). Injecting it
into lactating dairy cows increases milk production. It was developed
by four major pharmaceutical companies to help dairy farmers increase
milk output. Three of the four formulations of the synthetically
produced bGH are different from the structure of the naturally
occurring bovine growth hormone.  The Food and Drug Administration
has been reviewing bGH for eight years and is expected to make
a ruling soon. The Clinton administration recently agreed to a
90-day moratorium on the hormone if the FDA approves it.<BR>

<P>
&quot;The FDA is only looking at whether cows injected with the
hormone are healthy and whether bGH affects human safety,&quot;
Liebhardt said. &quot;I believe bGH would hurt smaller and mid-sized
dairy farms and, as a result, the economic vitality of rural communities.
Our study of the issue also shows clearly that a majority of consumers
will not accept milk from bGH-treated dairy cows.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In 1990 Liebhardt organized the multidisciplinary team of researchers
to compare how bGH and rotational grazing affect a range of factors
- individual cows, farms, farmers, farm families, rural communities
and consumers. &quot;Traditionally, scientists take a narrowly
focused approach to research,&quot; Liebhardt added. &quot;But
the consequences of this new technology are so far-reaching that
I felt compelled to take a broader look at bGH and compare it
to rotational grazing, which in my view offers dairy farmers a
profitable alternative, rural communities the assurance that more
small and mid-sized farms will stay in business, and consumers
the assurance that their milk is a safe, wholesome, untainted
product.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Rotational grazing decreases or eliminates confinement feeding
and shifts the work of harvesting and maintaining soil fertility
back to the animal, Liebhardt said. He noted that rotational grazing
improves herd health in comparison to confinement feeding systems.
Properly managed pasture feeding minimizes mastitis-caused bacterial
infections that contaminate milk and results in economic losses
for dairies, he added. According to the numerous case studies
used in Liebhardt's research, pasture-grazed cows also tend to
have higher reproductive performance, reduced lameness from leg
or hoof problems and few metabolic and digestive orders.<BR>

<P>
<B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A></B>, SAREP nutritionist and food system analyst,
wrote a chapter on consumer and food safety concerns about bGH.
She found that numerous studies from throughout the country indicate
that many consumers are concerned with both short-term milk safety,
and the unknown, long-term health effects bGH may cause for both
humans and animals. Furthermore, surveys cited in the book show
that if farmers use bGH, many consumers will buy less of that
milk and seek alternatives. In all the studies consumers overwhelmingly
indicated that they want bGH milk labeled. <BR>

<P>
Feenstra also discusses concerns that bGH may increase dairy cows'
susceptibility to mastitis, an udder infection that results in
increased treatment with antibiotics. Although milk is tested
for antibiotics, some residues enter the milk supply, she says.
Antibiotic residues in milk can affect humans who are allergic
to even trace amounts of residues. Excessive use of antibiotics
can promote the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <BR>

<P>
The book also addresses the economics of dairy management under
both bGH and rotational grazing management systems. BGH would
increase dairy farmers' profits by increasing the cows' milk production.
Rotational grazing's system of pasture grazing, on the other hand,
increases dairy profits by cutting feed costs, and shifts much
of the work of harvesting and maintaining soil fertility back
to the animal, according to<B> Leslie &quot;Bees&quot; Butler</B>,
a<B> </B>contributing author and a marketing economist in the
UC Davis Department of Agricultural Economics. <BR>

<P>
Butler identifies a key problem associated with adopting any new
technology: &quot;If one dairy farmer adopts the bGH technology
and increases milk production, he or she will benefit,&quot; he
said. &quot;If, however, a significant number of other producers
adopt the technology, then milk production will increase at the
national level. If milk production increases nationwide, it is
likely that milk prices will eventually adjust to a point where
producers are not better off financially than they were prior
to the availability of the bGH technology. This is called the
technology 'treadmill effect,' and is common in agriculture.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A>, SAREP economic and public policy analyst and author
of a chapter on the social and economic consequences of bGH on
rural communities, said that the major issues about bGH are &quot;not
new and technical, but old and essentially political. They have
less to do with determining whether milk is safe and cows are
healthy than with deciding the proper role of government in regulating
economic affairs or the amount of control ordinary citizens can
have in government research and economic policies.&quot; Seven
studies Campbell reviewed show that bGH would accelerate the trend
toward a concentration of larger farms and hasten the demise of
smaller and mid-size dairy operations. &quot;Today 5 percent of
the nation's farms produce half the total agricultural output,&quot;
he said. &quot;If this trend continues, in 10 years one percent
of all U.S. farms will produce most of our food.&quot; As a result,
Campbell adds, the collapse of the small and midsize dairies is
likely to have a harmful effect on the communities and regions
they support. <BR>

<P>
Co-author<B> William M. Murphy</B>, professor of agronomy at the
University of Vermont, noted that case studies show rotational
grazing improves the quality of life for farmers. &quot;The flexibility
of a rotational grazing system allows farmers to accommodate personal
goals and spend more time with family and in community activities,&quot;
he said. &quot;It also supports the continued existence of a thriving,
diversified rural landscape, a less tangible but equally significant
benefit of rural living.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<B>Edward Rayburn</B>, an Extension forage agronomist at West
Virginia Extension Service, said that rotational grazing would
increase pasture acreage and decrease grain crop acreage. He noted
that pastures have about double the organic matter content of
land devoted to grain crops. Soil organic matter is a reservoir
for carbon (carbon dioxide) and nitrogen (nitrates). He concluded
that land devoted to pastures indirectly contributes to improved
soil, air and water quality. &quot;Rotational grazing would reduce
farm-related environmental problems, resulting in 24 to 31 percent
less soil erosion and 23 to 26 percent less fuel use in crop production,&quot;
he said. <BR>

<H1>On-Farm Conversion Studies at UCSC<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's note: Sustainable Agriculture News</B> <I>features
occasional articles from other UC programs which have similar
goals. The following article is by </I><B>Martha Brown</B>, <I>publications
coordinator, UCSC Agroecology Program.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Research efforts at the UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program include
a focus on production farm systems in transition from conventional,
high-input management to sustainable, low-input management.  Program
researchers monitor a wide variety of factors including nutrient
levels, populations of pest and beneficial insects, economic inputs,
yield, and income to develop an overall picture of the agroecosystem
during the conversion process. They hope to identify major challenges
to growers who want to reduce or eliminate synthetic chemical
inputs, and suggest ways to mitigate yield losses. With funding
from the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program
and other sources, on-farm studies of strawberries, apples and
artichokes are underway. It is hoped that work will expand this
fall to include lettuce and cole crops.<BR>
<P>
Now reaching the close of its second season, the strawberry conversion
study has revealed several factors which can limit yield during
the transition process. Nutrient availability, soil temperature,
and the presence of beneficial insects appear to be key factors
affecting yield. Researchers will continue to work with Davenport
grower <B>Jim Cochran</B> to boost yields in the organic plots
by planting cover crops, increasing soil organic matter, and augmenting
beneficial insect populations.<BR>
<P>
Faculty, staff, and students from the Agroecology Program have
worked for one season with apple growers <B>Robert Stephens</B>
of Soquel and <B>Jim Rider</B> of Watsonville in studies of plots
undergoing conversion to certified organic management. These studies
have focused on codling moth infestations; they will be expanded
soon to examine changes in soil fertility in response to cover
crops and other amendments, weed growth, and vegetative growth
and yield in the two systems.<BR>
<P>
Artichoke grower <B>Ed Boutonet</B> and agronomist <B>Pete Puck</B>
of Castroville are cooperating with Agroecology Program members
in a study of artichoke acreage undergoing conversion to certified
organic management. Key factors being monitored include the response
of artichoke plume moth populations to microbial controls and
cultural management, soil fertility response to cover crops, and
the effects of organic soil amendments. The project will provide
data on crop responses as harvests begin in the fall.<BR>
<P>
The Agroecology Program hopes to document obstacles to alternative
management by working with growers. Overcoming these obstacles
will play a key part in reducing synthetic chemical use and ensuring
long-term economic and ecological sustainability. <BR>

<H1>FIRST ALMONDS . . . New Walnut BIOS Open to Farmers <BR>
</H1>

<P>
It's working for Almonds growers in Merced County, the Clinton
administration ration likes it, and now there's money for walnut
farmers in Yolo and Solano counties to participate in a new Biologically
Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program. More than $200,000
n grower incentives and technical support is now available for
farmers who wish to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals from
the walnut BIOS program,; <BR>

<P>
<B>Chuck Ingels,</B> SAREP perennial cropping systems analyst
and a member of the BIOS management team, notes that the program
is open t o 20 walnut growers, each of whom will enroll approximately
30 acres n the program.; With the help of the management team/
farmers and 0 their pest control advisors will develop a farm
plan, participate in on farm workshops, cover crop management,
innovative equipment use, beneficial insect releases, and earthworm
management, according to Ingels. <BR>

<P>
 USDA undersecretary of agriculture <B>Richard Rominger</B>, a
Winters farmer, recently visited almond BIOS program participants
and noted that &quot;These are the kinds of projects the Clinton
administration wants to see taking place all across the country.&quot;
Funding and services for BIOS are provided by Community Alliance
with Family Farmers Foundation and the USDA's Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, and by 0 grants from the Pew Charitable
Trust and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. For more information

</FONT>
<P>
It is well known that aerobic composting of animal manures results
in the loss of a portion of the nitrogen originally contained
in the manure. This loss can be ecologically significant if nitrate
leaches to groundwater or if large quantities of nitrogen gases
volatilize into the atmosphere. This paper quantifies these nitrogen
losses through research conducted under &quot;semi-technical conditions.&quot;
<BR>

<H3><B>Methods</B></H3>

<P>
The experiment utilized liquid manures from two pig sources, three
cattle sources and three poultry sources. Each type of manure
was mixed separately with chopped straw to form a homogeneous
mixture; a blend of all manure types was also used. The mixtures
were placed into individual composting tents in triangular heaps
about 2.5 feet tall. The composters had drain pipes to collect
the leachate and air sampling tubes to measure gaseous emissions.
The heaps were turned when average temperatures fell below 30
C (86 F), which was three to six times during the composting period.
After analysis, the collected leachate was sprayed back on the
outer edges of the heaps to prevent drying and to recycle leachate.
<BR>

<H3><B>Results</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Leaching.</B> During the composting period, about 10 to 20
percent of the initial nitrogen was recovered as leachate. Over
70 percent of the total nitrogen that was leached occurred within
the first ten days (before the first rewetting). As the composting
period progressed, leaching generally occurred only after the
heap was turned. The total nitrogen concentration of the leachate,
and to a large extent the amount of nitrogen carried with it,
was determined by the nitrogen content in the initial material.
The majority of the nitrogen leached was ammonium-nitrogen; much
less organic nitrogen and only minute quantities of nitrate (0.1-2.2%)
were recovered. The author implies that this small amount of nitrate
does not pose a significant threat to groundwater quality. <I>(Reviewer's
note: In soils, ammonium is usually quickly converted to nitrite
and then to nitrate through the process of nitrification. Therefore,
leachate from composting operations, if allowed to drain into
the soil, may indeed pollute groundwater.)<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Gaseous losses</B>. Fifty to 75 percent of the nitrogen in
the original mixture was lost to volatilization during the composting
process. The gases consisted primarily of ammonia, with very small
quantities of oxides of nitrogen. The most important factors that
increased ammonia losses were high nitrogen concentration of the
initial material, high compost temperature, and more frequent
turning.<BR>

<P>
Since the leachate was returned to the compost heap, the nitrogen
lost during the composting process was solely due to volatilization.
Although over half the nitrogen was lost by this means, total
nitrogen concentration actually increased. This apparent nutrient
enrichment was a result of about a 75 percent reduction in mass,
which was presumed to be caused by water loss.<BR>

<H3><B>Recommendations</B></H3>

<P>
The author notes that some loss can be prevented by capturing
the leachate and either using it to rewet the heap (when it is
protected from rain) or using it as a liquid fertilizer. Emissions
of ammonia and nitrous oxides are considered to be a more serious
ecological hazard from an air quality standpoint. Among the preventive
strategies for reducing gaseous losses are the appropriate use
of raw manure and composting at lower temperatures, although the
latter practice may allow weed seeds and pathogens to survive.
The use of natural materials with large adsorptive surfaces (e.g.,
bentonite) may also be useful. Finally, reducing the use of protein-rich
animal feeds could reduce the amount of ammonia released. Other
methods of reducing ammonia from waste gases in central facilities
are currently under investigation.<BR>

<H1>SAREP Coordinates Statewide Planning</H1>

<P>
As part of the new Chapter 3 program of the 1990 Farm Bill (authorized
in 1994), funding has been made liable for each state to develop
a statewide strategic plan for professional training in sustainable
agriculture, SAREP Director and State Extension Sustainable Agriculture
Leader<B> Bill Liebbardt</B>, and <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff6.html">David Chaney</A></B>, SAREP information
analyst, are coordinating this effort in California.  
<P>
As mentioned in the 1990 Farm Bill legislation, the target audiences
for this &quot;train the trainers&quot; program are Cooperative
Extension advisors, Natural Resources Conservation Service field
staff, and others involved in extending sustainable agriculture
information to farmers and ranchers.
<P>
To launch the planning effort in California, three focus groups
were held this past November and December in Merced, Riverside
and Davis to explore various options for training. Attending the
focus groups were representatives from the target groups mentioned
above, plus farmers and non-profit organizations involved in sustainable
agriculture.  A planning committee will be meeting over the next
few months to sift through the feedback obtained at these focus
group sessions, and to draft a prospectus for professional, in-service
training for California.  For more information contact Liebhardt
at (916) 752-2379

<H3>Cover Crop Fights Nematodes In Wyoming Sugarbeets</H3>

<P>
Researchers in Wyoming are finding that a cover crop of nematode-resistant
European fodder radish is an effective control for cyst nematodes
in sugarbeets.  Nematodes were down 57 percent compared to an
untreated control, and the following sugarbeets yielded over 30
percent more than in plots treated with aldicarb.  The five-ton
yield increase more than paid for the cost of the radish cover
crop.  The cover crop also helps protect the soil from wind erosion.
 Researchers plan to test whether the economics of the system
can be further improved by letting sheep graze the radish cover
in fall and then test to see if nematodes are still controlled
the following season.  For a copy of <I>SARE/ACE 1994 Project
Highlights, </I>which briefly describes this and other projects,
contact Kristen Kelleher, SARE/ACE Communications, University
of California, Davis, CA 95616.<BR>

<H3>Vaya con BIOS!</H3>

<P>
Three Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) projects
have been funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
and a fourth is now underway with no outside support.  In BIOS
growers and their pest control advisers work closely with an experienced
management team to implement practices that reduce their use of
pesticides and/or synthetic fertilizers.  BIOS is a project of
the.  Community Alliance with Family Farmers in collaboration
with SAREP, UC farm advisors, the Soil Conservation Service and
others.  BIOS projects currently funded by EPA include almonds
in Merced County (second year; 26 growers), almonds in Stanislaus
County (first year; 2030 growers), and walnuts in Yolo and Solano
Counties (first year; 15-20 growers).  <B>Ben Faber</B>, farm
advisor in Ventura County, has initiated a citrus BIOS project
with no outside funding; it has received overwhelming support
from growers.<BR>

<H3>Pesticide Use Increases by 20 Percent in 1992</H3>

<P>
After declining 12 percent between 1990 and 1991, agricultural
pesticide use in California rose sharply during 1992, according
to figures from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.
 Pesticides used in agriculture totaled 170.2 million pounds in
1992, up from 142.2 million pounds reported in 199 1. In 1990,
the first year for which records were available, pesticide use
was 163.1 million pounds.  Large fluctuations in pesticide use
from year to year are not unusual, due to variations in climate
and pest invasions.  As they had been in 199 1, the top five crops
by amount of pesticide use were table grapes, processed grapes,
almonds, cotton, and sugar beets.  Sulfur, used on both conventional
and organic farms, is the most widely used chemical in the state
(61.8 million pounds).  Following sulfur in order of total reported
use are methyl bromide (1 9 million pounds), petroleum oil (19
million pounds), metam-sodium (8.6 million pounds), and sodium
chlorate (4 million pounds).  The 1992 <I>Summary of Pesticide
Use Report Data </I>is available in two volumes, indexed by chemical
or by commodity.  To receive a copy send $25 for each volume to:
Cashier, California Department of Pesticide Regulation, 1020 N
Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.<BR>

<H3>Mevinphos Withdrawn from U.S. Market</H3>

<P>
In June 1994, the Amvac Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles voluntarily
withdrew the pesticide mevinphos (brand name Phosdrin) from the
U.S. market.  The company's action was prompted by planned state
and federal EPA actions to ban the product due to repeated incidents
of farmworker poisonings.  Mevinphos is a broadspectrum organophosphate
used on 22 crops such as strawberries, lemons, broccoli, spinach
and lettuce.  Because U.S. law does not prohibit pesticides banned
in this country from being sold overseas, Amvac plans to continue
production of Mevinphos for export.  For more information, contact:

<H3>Kellogg Foundation Expands Integrated Farming Systems Initiative
</H3>

<P>
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation has announced a second round of nine
demonstration projects aimed at encouraging more integrated and
resource-efficient farming systems.  These projects join nine
others funded during 1993, including the California Alliance for
Sustainable Agriculture (CASA).  Each of the 18 funded projects
represents a unique collaboration among non-profit organizations
and university programs.  Organizations in the Western Region
funded during the second phase of the initiative include: Marketing
and Production Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture, Oregon State
University (Corvallis, Oregon); and Washington State University
(Pullman, Washington).  For more information on Kellogg projects
contact Jon Miller, (616) 968-161 1. Information on CASA can be
obtained from Project Coordinator Kerstin Ohlander,(408)459-4786.

Soil Use and Management 6(4):168-173. 1990<BR>
<P>
This review paper summarizes the influence of crop nutrition and
fertilizers on soil-borne diseases in annual cropping systems.
Effects of nutrients have been confirmed by: 1) evidence of how
different fertilizer practices affect disease severity; 2) comparisons
of the mineral concentrations in resistant and susceptible cultivars;
and 3) correlation of other practices (organic matter additions,
crop rotations, etc...) and conditions that influence mineral
availability with disease incidence or severity. The influence
of fertilizers has been directly attributed to effects on survival
and germination of the pathogen, and/or effects on its penetration
and virulence. As plant nutrition is improved, other benefits
accrue including: enhanced disease resistance, disease escape
from rapid growth rates, and root exudates that support a beneficial
soil microflora. Numerous examples are cited with references.
<BR>
<P>
Take-all of cereals <I>(Gaeumannomyces graminis) </I>has been
extensively studied in this respect. A table of different soil
conditions which increase or decrease this disease is provided.
In general, take-all is more prevalent in alkaline, low-fertility
soils <FONT SIZE=4>and </FONT>under conditions which increase
nitrification such as nitrate application and liming. In contrast,
eyespot<I> (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides) </I>and sharp
eyespot <I>(Rhizoctonia cerealis) </I>are increased<B> </B>through
top-dressing<I><B> </B></I>with ammonium.<BR>
<P>
Adjustment of pH is another important means of preventing plant
disease mainly through its effect on nutrient availability and
uptake. Maintaining a high soil pH through liming (and in some
cases through application of calcium and/or nitrate) is recommended
for management of:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>club root of crucifers
<LI>fusarium wilt diseases
<LI>root and hypocotyl rots (<I>F. solani, R. solani</I>)
<LI>rot and damping off caused by <I>Pythium</I> spp.
<LI><I>Sclerotium rolfsii</I>
<LI>aflatoxin in peanuts
<LI>soft rot of potatoes, carrot, bean (<I>Erwinia </I>spp.) 
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Lowering soil pH through application of ammonium and manganese
has been shown to decrease take-all of cereals, stalk rot of maize,
common scab of potato, phymatotrichum root rot of cotton, verticillium
wilt of various crops and various other diseases.<BR>

<H1>Worldwide Long-Term Research</H1>
<P>
Why study farmland for hundreds of years?  Historically, societies
that did not manage their natural resources have failed.  The
Babylonians salted themselves out of the Fertile Crescent with
poor water management.  Inappropriate management of slash-and-burn
agriculture in Central America has gradually destroyed communities.
 These societies raise questions concerning the processes that
influence the sustainability of agricultural resources.  To understand
these processes, it is necessary to gather information over long
periods of time.<BR>
<P>
The idea of long-term farmland research sites is not new.  Europe,
North America, the Middle East and Australia are homes to long-term
research.  The &quot;Mecca&quot; of long-term farmland research
is the Rothamsted Classical Experiments in Southern England. 
The plots are examples of temperate, humid sites where data on
continuous cropping have been collected since 1843.  An unirrigated
Mediterranean climate long-term farmland research experiment began
in 1880 at the Kybybolite Experimental Farm in South Australia.
<BR>
<P>
Numerous long-term research sites in North America have been monitored
since the late 19th century - 25 for more than 25 years.  Of those,
12 have been monitored for more than 50 years. One hundred fifteen
years of data on continuous cropping have been collected at the
temperate humid Morrow Plots on the Urbana campus of the University
of Illinois.  The University of Missouri at Columbia's Sanborn
Field was established in 1888.  The Magruder Plots on the Stillwater
campus of Oklahoma State University began in 1892, while The University
of Nebraska at Scotts Bluff established a continuous study in
1912.<BR>
<P>
Other sites include six locations of the Auburn University in
Alabama, the Breton Plots at the University of Alberta in Edmonton,
Canada, and a crop residue study at the USDA-ARS in Pendleton,
Oregon.  New York, North Dakota, North Carolina, Minnesota, Kansas,
Michigan and Wisconsin are the homes of other long-term research.
<BR>
<P>
In California, 80 years of intensive agricultural management has
imposed a whole new environment onto the land.  The microclimates
in huge sections of the state have been transformed from dry hot
summers to more humid, irrigated environments.  Researchers and
farmers alike recognize that this creates a great potential for
the destabilization of natural resources.  The UCD site will demonstrate
the effects of long-term farming practices in California's hot
dry Mediterranean climate on an irrigated site.  (UCD was the
home of a 25-year irrigated covercrop trial;  initiated in 1924
on the site of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital, it compared
the use of cover crops with clean-cultivated orchards through
1948.)<BR>
<P>
Long-term farmland research sites are field laboratories for on-going
studies of fundamental mechanisms that influence the sustainability
of agricultural systems.  While the emphasis of long-term studies
is on research and data collection over a long period, it is not
necessary to wait 50 years for the results to be useful;  information
can be gathered and distributed continuously. Education is a critical
product of long-term farmland research. <I>-<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A><BR>

<P>
<B>Jim Grieshop</B> of the UC Davis Department of Applied Behavioral
Sciences, and graduate students <B>Arnaz Raj</B>, <B>Maureen Plas</B>,
and <B>Andy Karas</B>, worked with SAREP and the UC Small Farm
Center to survey participants at seven farm conferences last fall
and winter, including the 1990 annual Farm Conference in Visalia,
four conferences oriented toward farmers making a transition to
more sustainable methods, and two general conferences sponsored
by the California Farm Bureau.<BR>
<P>
The survey asked questions about growers' concerns and practices,
and asked them to mark where they believe they are on a continuum
from &quot;High Ecological&quot; (high concern for the environment;
very judicious use of inputs; minimal reliance on man-made resources;
reduced use of chemicals; increased conservation of soil, water,
and energy) to &quot;High Conventional&quot; (effective use of
new and traditional technologies and practices, chemicals, and
natural resources; centralized arrangements and agricultural practices
for effective management and production; primary reliance on resources
and practices that maintain desired level of production). Farmers'
ratings in three five-year intervals show a pronounced shift toward
a more ecological orientation (see Figure, page 1). While just
under half rate themselves on the ecological end of the scale
today (categories 1-3), and less than one-third considered themselves
to be in those categories in 1985,<I> </I>more than 75 percent
expect to be using more ecological production practices in 1995.
<BR>
<P>
Grieshop and Raj are analyzing the survey data to compare these
overall self-ratings with responses to questions on specific concerns
and production practices. More results from the survey will be
made public in the next few months. In a similar study conducted
for the American Farmland Trust in 1989 <I>(Agriculture and the
Environment: A Study of Farmers' Practices and Perceptions,</I>
J. Dixon Esseks, editor) very little relationship was found between
farmers' self-identification as &quot;low-input,&quot; &quot;sustainable,&quot;
&quot;organic,&quot; or &quot;conventional,&quot; and the production
methods they reported using. Will the same be true of California
growers in this survey? Or do growers who describe themselves
as more ecological adopt different farming practices? <BR>

<H1>New Directions in Almond Pest Management?</H1>
<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Recent developments in the management of two key almond insect
pests show promise in allowing growers to greatly reduce or eliminate
the use of synthetic insecticides.  The pests, navel orangeworm
<I>(Amyelois transitella) </I>and peach twig borer <I>(Anarsia
lineatella) </I>have for years plagued growers, although effective
integrated pest management techniques have been developed to minimize
their damage.  Current and potential management strategies differ
greatly for the two insects; however, the potential ability to
control peach twig borer without disruptive chemicals may have
important impacts on navel orangeworm control.
<H3>B.t. Research</H3>
<P>
<I>Peach Twig Borer.  </I>University of California researchers,
funded by the Almond Board of California, are conducting alternative
pest management field trials (Zalom, 1990).  Investigators have
been testing the efficacy of Javelin&reg;, a formulation of <I>Bacillus
thuringiensis </I>(B.t.) for control of peach twig borer and navel
orangeworm.  B.t. is a bacterial insecticide with no toxic effect
on mammals.  Tests for the control of peach twig borer (PTB) were
conducted in Colusa County in 1990.  &quot;Although results must
be considered preliminary, it appeared that two treatments of
Javelin&reg; bracketing bloom....gave up to 80% control,&quot;
according to the report.<BR>
<P>
<B>John Edstrom</B>, Colusa County farm advisor, discussed the
1990 results of B.t. studies at the Regional Almond Growers Meeting
in Woodland last February.  According to Edstrom, four Javelin&reg;
sprays applied from bud swell to early leaf were nearly as effective
in reducing twig strikes as Supracide&reg;, a conventional insecticide
treatment.  Spraying at any other time, including late spring
or in the dormant season, is far less effective.  He said that
two sprays, one at the 'popcorn' stage of bloom and one during
late bloom is probably adequate.  He added that there may be little
difference in cost between the two control methods.<BR>
<P>
According to Edstrom, results from this year's trial look encouraging.
 But he noted that the best time to apply B.t. may change from
year to year.  &quot;So far, we have just related the timing to
the crop, but this may not be the correct approach- it's the phenology
(development) of the insect that matters.  We don't know if the
phenology of the pest is in synchrony with that of the tree. 
If so, then the timing of sprays at bloom development is convenient.&quot;
  The researchers will be evaluating nut damage this season. 
Edstrom cautioned that at this time, growers should<B> not</B>
substitute standard dormant<I> </I>season sprays with B.t. alone.
 He said results are only preliminary; additionally, standard
PTB sprays are effective on mite and scale pests while B.t. is
not.  (<B>Frank Zalom</B>, UC Statewide Integrated Pest Management
Project director at Davis, said that dormant sprays of oil alone
can effectively control mite eggs and offer some degree of control
for scale insects as well.)  Scale buildup over a period of several
years is also being evaluated in the B.t. experiments.<BR>
<P>
There are several concerns with the use of B.t., including rain
at bloom washing off the spray or preventing spraying, and the
need for more sprays in the case of an extended leafout period,
according to Edstrom.  Field resistance to 15 sprays per season
of B.t. has been reported (Tabashnik, 1990), but two to four sprays
on almonds are not expected to induce resistance.<BR>
<P>
<I>Navel Orangeworm.</I>  Two years of field research on navel
orangeworm (NOW) control with B.t. have given mixed results which
are not as promising as PTB control.  The experiments have been
carried out in Butte and Kern Counties using Guthion&reg; and
Javelin&reg;, alone and in combination, and at different rates
and timings.  The results of these studies &quot;confirm the observations
of many individuals that no currently registered insecticide provides
adequate control of NOW.  The only true effective control we can
recommend is good sanitation (mummy removal) and early harvest,&quot;
according to the report.  The latter two practices, as detailed
by the UC Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project Almond
Manual (1985), have been very effective of controlling NOW and
in many cases have eliminated the need for in-season insecticide
sprays. <BR>
<H3>Navel Orangeworm Parasites</H3>
<P>
Another approach to NOW control is beginning to attract the attention
of growers and researchers alike.  In the 1970's, <B>Fred Legner</B>,
entomology professor at UC Riverside, found the insect parasite
<I>Goniozus legneri</I> attacking NOW larvae in the southern Uruguay
and Argentina (Legner et al., 1982).  In 1979 he began releasing
hundreds of thousands of the parasites into unsprayed almond orchards
throughout California.  In spite of these releases <I>Goniozus</I>
did not become established in sprayed orchards until recently,
probably as a result of dormant and in-season insecticide sprays.
 According to <B>Bill Barnett</B>, area IPM advisor for the central
San Joaquin Valley, at least two Reedly and Kingsburg orchards
were found to have very large parasite populations in the fall
of 1989.  Large populations of the parasite were also found in
1990, but not as many as the previous year.  &quot;It seems that
<I>Goniozus</I> is either becoming better distributed or maybe
it's adapting to the San Joaquin Valley, because it is more common
than it was a few years ago,&quot; according to Barnett.  The
parasite has not yet become well established in the Sacramento
Valley, he said.<BR>
<P>
Another NOW parasite, <I>Pentalitomastix plethoricus</I>, was
introduced from Mexico by current UC Berkeley Biological Control
Division Chair Leo Caltagirone in the 1960s and is now present
in many California almond orchards, including those in the Sacramento
Valley.  In many cases the two species work together to control
NOW more effectively than either parasite alone.  According to
Barnett, however, one of the problems with<I> Pentalitomastix</I>
is that it does not build up in large numbers until May, after
the over-wintering generation of NOW has emerged and laid its
eggs.  Part of the preliminary work with this parasite was to
bring parasitized larvae into the orchard early in the hope that
they could emerge earlier, but this method proved to be unsuccessful,
Barnett said.<BR>
<H3>Standard Control Methods</H3>
<P>
As noted, the two most important management strategies for NOW
in almonds are sanitation and early harvest.  Sanitation involves
mechanically shaking or hand poling the trees until no more than
two mummy nuts remain on the trees of soft-shelled cultivars in
January.  The fallen mummy nuts then are blown off weed-free berms
and shredded or tilled in by March.  For orchards in which sanitation
is not carried out or where neighboring orchards provide a source
of NOW, in-season insecticide treatments are recommended.  These
sprays usually kill beneficial insects and can result in mite
or other pest flare-ups.  Therefore, the importance of sanitation
cannot be overstated.<BR>
<P>
The conventional method for controlling PTB has been to annually
apply a dormant spray of oil and organophosphate insecticide,
such as parathion.  Then spring sprays would only be required
if the orchard has a history of PTB damage.  Dormant spraying
has the advantage of controlling other pests like San Jose scale
and mites; also, fewer beneficial insects are killed at this time.
 However, dormant season organophosphate sprays, which are also
used on most stone fruits, may be lost as a result of several
environmental factors:  They pose danger to protected wildlife
such as Red-tailed hawks, they have been found in high levels
in fog, and they have drifted onto neighboring sites, including
vegetable farms.<BR>
<H3>PTB - NOW Connection?</H3>
<P>
Preliminary data indicates B.t. <B>may</B> be an effective substitute
for in-season and dormant sprays for PTB.  If so, it may be possible
to use NOW parasites with greater reliability.  According to Frank
Zalom, the parasites may be killed even by the dormant season
organophosphate sprays. He said that <I>Goniozus </I>spends at
least part of the winter between the hull and the nut, so the
parasites are more exposed to the fuming action of the insecticide.
 &quot;We're assuming that these sprays are hurting the parasites
but we really don't know,&quot; he said.  The preliminary success
of B.t. for PTB control, along with the uncertain future of dormant
season organophosphate applications, point to increased potential
for NOW control with parasites.<BR>
<P>
Little research has been done on the number of parasites required
for adequate control of NOW. Furthermore, the recommended practice
of leaving a maximum of two mummy nuts per tree does not take
into account the presence of parasites.  According to Zalom, orchards
in some areas now have up to 60 to 70 percent parasitism in the
winter.  In these orchards, a large number of emerging parasites
will seek out the next generation of NOW.  If a sufficient parasite
population is present, it may be possible to allow far more mummy
nuts (and unparasitized larvae) to remain in the trees in the
winter.  The result may be an equivalent of the maximum two mummy
nuts per tree, Zalom said.<BR>
<P>
If no parasites have been found in an orchard, it may be necessary
to release them into the orchard in order to establish a sufficient
population.  It seems likely that ensuring the establishment of
a parasite population by the fall would aid in substantial parasitism
of overwintering mummy nuts.<BR>
<H3>Potential Risks and Problems</H3>
<P>
What are the risks of not removing overwintering mummy nuts? 
While virtually no one is yet willing to recommend leaving these
nuts, the recent buildup of parasites is causing researchers and
farm advisors to think about reconsidering strategies.  The primary
risk is ending up with severe NOW outbreaks if the parasites are
not present or are ineffective.  &quot;I'd want to make sure that
the grower knows that they have a lot of parasites out there,&quot;
Zalom cautioned.  &quot;One of the main problems is that a dirty
orchard becomes a source of NOW for neighbors as well.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>Lonnie Hendricks</B>, Merced County farm advisor, also urges
caution and said in a January newsletter (Hendricks, 1991) that
&quot;the transition could be rocky, but the payoff could be a
successful insect management program without the cost of either
insecticides or winter cleanup.&quot;  He noted that there are
several conditions that are required to establish such a biocontrol
program:  &quot;1) a grower willing, able, and determined to take
the risk and manage the parasite/prey complex; 2) a pest control
consultant to help establish <I>Goniozus </I>and to advise with
pest management; 3) an orchard already in good balance with minimal
sprays and no major existing pest problems; and 4) a good cover
crop program to encourage general beneficials.&quot;   Hendricks
(1989) noted that general parasites, such as <I>Trichogramma </I>and
other wasps, and general predators, such as spiders, lacewings,
ladybugs can be very effective in suppressing NOW and PTB.  Hendricks
has been involved in a SAREP-funded project comparing orchards
using six different management systems.  In the organic orchard,
in which a vetch cover crop is allowed to grow through spring,
beneficial insect populations are high while NOW,  PTB and other
pest insects levels are extremely low.  Nut reject levels have
been well below industry averages.<BR>
<P>
While NOW control using parasites may require leaving some mummies
in the trees, there could be cost savings if parasites became
established and mummy removal became unnecessary.  This is especially
true in dry winters, in which mummy nuts are more difficult and
expensive to remove (moisture-laden nuts fall off more easily).
 A potential problem is that severe storms may knock most of the
mummy nuts off trees, possibly reducing the reservoir of host
NOW larvae. However, Barnett noted that those that land on the
weed-free strip on the orchard floor remain intact and can still
support the parasites.  Virtually all nuts that fall onto cover
crops disintegrate over the winter (Barnett et al., 1989).  Another
potential problem is a severe freeze like that in December 1990,
which may reduce overwintering parasite populations, according
to Barnett.<BR>
<H3>Grower Successes</H3>
<P>
The use of parasites alone for NOW control in almonds has been
successful for several California growers.  <B>Hans Bucher</B>,
a grower in Hilmar, Merced County, had almond reject levels of
up to 12 percent using conventional practices.  <I>Goniozus </I>was
released into his orchard in the early 1980s.  He now intentionally
leaves mummy nuts in the trees to the harbor the parasites.  He
uses <B>no</B> insecticides and his NOW rejects run about one
to 1.5 percent while his total rejects are about 2.5 percent to
five percent.  <B>Duane Jardine</B>, owner of Jardine Organic
Ranch in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, had up to 30 percent
NOW damage without insecticide sprays or sanitation before parasites
were released into his 60 acre orchard in 1982.  He still uses
no sprays and reject levels are consistently only one-half to
one percent.<BR>
<P>
Because parasite levels in many orchards are usually low, releases
may be required to get them established. <B> Larry Brown</B>,
president of Bo-Biotrol, Inc. in Merced, said that reject levels
from orchards into which several releases are made each year have
consistently been at or below the huller average, and sometimes
below one percent.  Few of these growers use in-season insecticide
sprays.  <I>Goniozus</I> parasites have also been released into
walnut orchards, which also suffer severe NOW damage, but they
have not become established to date.<BR>
<P>
The expanding interest in environmentally sensitive crop production
has sparked creative solutions by growers and researchers.  Recent
advancements in the non-disruptive control of key pests may hold
the key to sustainable production in many crops.<BR>

<P>
<I>Sims, G.K.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Advances in Soil Science 11:289-330.  1990<BR>
<P>
This extensive review (197 references) concerns the role of soil
microbiota in nutrient cycling, waste and residue decomposition,
and detoxification of environmental pollutants. If these processes
are disrupted, human health can ultimately be harmed. Not all
topics addressed pertain directly to agriculture, but the overall
treatment may help in understanding issues of soil health and
regeneration.<BR>
<H3>The Cast of Characters</H3>
<P>
Soil microbial communities are typically diverse. In addition,
the roles of the various species are inextricably interconnected,
so that, in experiments, direct and indirect treatment effects
may be indistinguishable. This article considers mainly the bacteria
and fungi.<BR>
<P>
<B>Soil bacteria</B> are mostly saprophytes or parasites. Their
single-celled structure gives them access to resources and refugia
unavailable to larger organisms, but it may be a disadvantage
in accessing nutrients that are contained in relatively large
particles (e.g., plant residues) that may contain valuable carbon,
but be deficient in other nutrients. Even motile bacterial types,
however, can occur in colonies in the soil, and this habit may
confer advantages such as improved nutrient mobilization and absorption,
and protection from drying, toxins, or ultraviolet radiation.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mycelial fungi and actinomycetes</B> have filamentous (threadlike
and branching) growth habits that may make them better suited
as early exploiters of relatively large fragments of lignified
plant residue, because they can transport various nutrients among
zones of enrichment. The filamentous habit also enables exploration
of large soil volumes, provides protection against being washed
through the soil profile, and permits specialization of cells
to fulfill various functions more efficiently.<BR>
<H3>Microbial Metabolism and Soil Processes</H3>
<P>
Microbial energetics (and all forms of metabolism) are driven
by the Gibbs free-energy yield derived from the chemical adenosine
5'-triphosphate (ATP). ATP can be generated by fermentation or
respiration. The latter requires terminal electron acceptors (e.g.,
nitrate, sulfate, carbon dioxide, ferric iron, or molecular hydrogen),
and producs greater amounts of  ATP per unit of substrate. Fermentation
is less feasible in the presence of either highly oxidized or
highly reduced substrates, and results in accumulation of toxic
products (simple organic acids) that can eventually impede the
process.<BR>
<P>
Oxygenases are enzymes involved in the breakdown of aromatic and
aliphatic compounds (e.g., lignins, hydrocarbons, various pesticides),
and the dehalogenation of xenobiotic compounds. These processes,
important in nutrient cycling and in detoxification of soils,
can only occur in the presence of oxygen. (Reviewer's note: dehalogenation
by <I>oxygenases </I>can only occur in the presence of oxygen,
but dehalogenation <I>per se </I>may be more rapid under anaerobic
conditions.) The pH of the soil solution is another factor that
governs enzymatic activity. Particular enzymes (even if membrane
bound) are only active over a narrow pH range.<BR>
<H3>Microbially-Mediated Soil Processes</H3>
<P>
<B>Carbon</B> entering the soil from plant sources (e.g., as cellulose)
usually leaves as carbon dioxide or methane. At first glance,
impairment of soil carbon cycling would seem to require severe
environmental insult, because many species of soil fungi and bacteria
can degrade cellulose. Nonetheless, such impairment has been observed
in the field.<BR>
<P>
<B>Nitrogen</B> cycling includes mineralization, immobilization,
nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation.  N-fixation
and nitrification are most easily disrupted. Nitrifying bacteria
(e.g., <I>Nitrosomonas </I>and <I>Nitrobacter) </I>are sensitive
to acidity and require aerobic conditions. Waterlogged soils can
become anoxic and may not support nitrification. Symbiotic nitrogen
fixation is a delicate and complicated phenomenon. Nodulation
of legumes could be impeded by some kinds of pollutant molecules.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Phosphorus</B> cycling could conceivably be impeded by anything
that interferes with mycorrhizal fungi. Cycles involving sulfur,
iron, manganese and other elements depend to varying degrees on
microorganisms. These processes are not discussed in detail in
the article.<BR>
<H3>Indicators of Biological Degradation</H3>
<P>
Sims identifies four general approaches to measuring biological
degradation.<BR>
<P>
<B>Community diversity</B> can<FONT SIZE=4> </FONT>be used to
assess perturbation of soil biology. Bacteria and fungi can be
evaluated by &quot;viable count&quot; methods, most involve plating
on nutrient-rich agar. These methods are controversial, as are
their alternatives.  Biodiversity of soil microbial communities
can be measured by various mathematical indices that emphasize
richness (number of species), equitability (evenness of allocation
of individuals among the various species), or combinations of
these two. There is no clear indication that more diverse soil
communities are more resistant to pertrbation.<BR>
<P>
<B>Nutrient cycling</B> can be indexed by measurement of soil
enzymes, various components of the N cycle, cellulose or wood
degradation, and of respiration.<BR>
<P>
<B>Accumulation of pollutants.</B> Toxins may accumulate if soil
microbial life is degraded. The soil's ability to dechlorinate
organic compounds can be impaired, especially in sulfate-rich
anaerobic environments. Heavy application of animal wastes to
low- pH soils can lead to buildup of ammonium and a concomitant
reduced functioning of <I>Nitrobacter. </I>This effect can result
in nitrite accumulation.<BR>
<P>
<B>Redox status.</B> Anaerobic conditions can arise as a result
of compaction or waterlogging. Oxygen diffusion is only 1/10,000
as fast through water-filled soil pores as it is through air-filled
pores.  Production of large amounts of methane would indicate
the strongly reducing conditions associated with anoxia.<BR>
<P>
<B>Effects of Toxic Substances on Microorganisms</B>
<P>
Generally speaking, organic compounds are readily degraded in
warm climates, and less so in cold. Toxic metals, on the other
hand, can remain in soils and cause long-term damage to soil microbial
communities regardless of temperature. Sims discusses the effects
of pesticides and organic and inorganic pollutants.<BR>
<P>
<B>Pesticides.</B> Pesticides can influence soil microbial activity,
at times paradoxically. Application of paraquat led to buildup
of fungi and bacteria, but reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB>  production,
cellulose degradation, and nitrogenase activity. Sometimes selective
destruction of predators and the resultant buildup of their microbial
prey can occur. For example, glyphosate or diquat + paraquat application
led to the buildup of <I>Gaeumannomyces graminis </I>var. <I>tritici,
</I>the causal agent of take-all disease of wheat. Inoculation
with untreated soil led to suppression of the pathogen in the
treated soil, suggesting the possible role of microbial antagonists.
<BR>
<P>
Nitrification and symbiotic nitrogen fixation are especially sensitive
to disruption by pesticides, probably in part due to the small
numbers of species involved in these processes. At normal application
rates, Amitrole, 2,4-DB, and diallate can inhibit nitrification
for at least 8 weeks, whereas atrazine, bromacil, picloram, and
simazine can do so for shorter periods. Some degradation products
of these substances may also be inhibitory. There are also examples
of no effect and (paradoxically) even stimulation of nitrification
for some of the pesticides mentioned above. For symbiotic nitrogen
fixation, denitrification, and ammonification, there are also
cases of inhibition, no effect, and stimulation, but no specifics
are recounted. Soil respiration is relatively in-sensitive to
pesticide application, but antimicrobials, e.g., fungicides, can
suppress it. (Reviewer's note: soil respiration is frequently
increased upon addition of pollutants because they kill sensitive
species which are then digested by survivors.)<BR>
<P>
<B>Toxic organic and inorganic pollutants.</B> These compounds
can result from chemical synthesis, coal mining, and petroleum
processing. Organic pesticides show less dramatic effects on soil
microbiology than do other classes of toxic organics, probably
because the former are screened to avoid such effects.<BR>
<P>
Oil spills in cold regions cause long-term damage to soil microbiology,
including adverse effects on carbon (e.g., cellulose degradation)
and nitrogen cycling (especially nitrification and nitrogen fixation).
Some alleviation and enhanced degradation of n-alkanes occurred
through fertilization with urea and phosphate. Addition of oil-degrading
bacteria showed little promise. Addition of retorted oil shale
(that from which oil has been extracted) can reduce soil fungal
growth and bacterial species diversity, which is also adversely
affected by pyridine contained in the retort water. Revegetation
lessened the effect of oil shale, apparently because bacteria
are insulated in the rhizospheres of the range plants employed.
<BR>
<P>
Contamination by heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) can cause
long-term suppression of carbon cycling, microbial biomass, nitrogen
fixation, nitrification, dehydrogenase activity, and mycorrhizal
incidence. Toxic metals can be abundant in some sewage sludges.
Microbes can mobilize and increase the toxicity of cadmium, perhaps
by producing water-soluble ligands or otherwise changing soil
properties.<BR>
<H3>Effects of Mining Operations on Soil Biology</H3>
<P>
Acidification can occur when excavation of ores containing iron
sulfides leads to oxidative production of sulfates. Discharge
waters from mine spoils may have pH values of 1-2, and can cause
severe problems off site. Waters draining from coal mines and
associated spoils can be high in Zn, Cu, Ni, or Mn, all potentially
toxic. Reclamation of strip-mined sites does not arrest such discharges
immediately.<BR>
<H3>Effects of Land Management on Soil Biology</H3>
<P>
In addition to the effects of pesticides and other toxic materials,
soil biology may also be affected through various land management
practices, including forest management and crop production.<BR>
<P>
<B>Forest management.</B>   Prescribed burning in forests can
lead to increased pH and availability of Ca and Mg. On the other
hand, hot fires can lead to loss of S, P, and B, and destruction
of surface structure leading to lowered infiltration and increased
runoff and erosion. Cool fires can lead to formation of hydrophobic
surface layers that decrease infiltration and consequent soil
moisture. On the other hand, fires can also inhibit certain fungi
whose mycelia previously imparted a hydrophobic character to the
soil surface. Under these conditions, infiltration can be increased.
If fire darkens the soil surface and increases insolation by opening
the forest canopy, soil temperatures can be increased. Effects
of fire on soil microbiology are usually transitory, and mainly
involve the surface strata. There can be increased nitrogen fixation
following burns and either long-term increase or decrease in nitrification.
<BR>
<P>
Clearcutting of hardwood deciduous or conifer forests leads to
a reduction of litter inputs, increased microbial breakdown of
litter, and a consequent reduction in forest-floor biomass, decreased
shading, and increased soil temperature and pH. The latter two
phenomena lead to increased nitrification, which can in turn lead
to nitrate-rich runoff and pollution of nearby streams. In-creased
release of nitrous oxide, a significant greenhouse gas, may also
occur.<BR>
<P>
<B>Cropping Practices.</B> Studies on farming practices, including
the long-term studies at Broadbalk Field, England, illustrate
the constancy of some soil biological processes under continuous
cropping and fertilization regimes. One plot received no nitrogen
fertilizer, but P, K, Na, and Mg were added. Annual biological
nitrogen fixation was estimated to be 40-60 kg N/ha, and soil
N content remained between 0.107 percent and 0.105 percent. These
values have remained virtually the same for over 100 years. Several
studies of rice culture have yielded analogous results, and have
also shown that the addition of N fertilizer arrests fixation
by cyanobacteria in sediment and water, and by heterotrophic bacteria
in the rhizosphere.<BR>
<P>
Microbial communities appear to be tolerant of normal farming
practices, but are at best barely able to meet the nitrogen requirements
of crops. Fallowing may lead to reduced microbial biomass, mainly
through reduction of fungi. The addition of manures may raise
carbon and nitrogen levels in soils without affecting numbers
of bacteria, fungi, or protozoa. There is no clear evidence that
<P>
pesticides or fertilizers cause long-term degeneration of soil
microbial diversity or biochemical potential.<BR>
<P>
Soil erosion is particularly deleterious to organic matter, which
is less dense than other soil solids and at times less so than
water itself. The clay fraction of soil, to which organic matter
is often adsorbed, is particularly vulnerable to erosion. Vesicular-arbuscular
mycorrhizae (VAM) can be adversely affected even by mild soil
erosion. Survival of rhizobia in eroded soils may depend on their
tolerances to pH of deeper soil horizons; soil pH, of course,
is amenable to correction. Soil resistance to erosion is itself
dictated in part by microbial activity, including the binding
of water-stable aggregates through polysaccharidic exudates or
VAM hyphae. Under tillage, carbohydrates associated with clay
are relatively stable, but 27-43 percent of the total polysaccharides
are contained in the light fraction, and these are subject to
rapid loss. Carbohydrates as a class appear no more unstable than
other classes of soil carbon taken together. Cultivation can lead
to decreases in aggregate stability and increased susceptibility
to soil erosion. In one study, soil under virgin prairie showed
greater aggregate stability than soil cultivated for 14 years.
Soil carbon associated with macroaggregates declined under cultivation.
 On the other hand, a study concerning a waterlogged meadow frequently
fertilized with ammonium sulfate showed deteriorating soil structure
while organic matter increased. This may have been due to acidification
and the consequent adverse effects on bridges formed by divalent
cations, which are important (along with polysaccharides and hyphae)
in maintaining aggregate stability. The chronic waterlogging probably
also interfered with organic matter cycling and aggregate formation.
<BR>
<P>
Tillage, particularly of virgin lands, can lead to immediate and
short-term increases in microbial biomass and metabolism. On the
other hand, soil mesofauna may decline. Earthworms are often adversely
affected, but not always. Incorporation of crop residues disperses
microbial activity to a greater depth than is seen in reduced-tillage
systems. The latter show aerobes, facultative anaerobes, and nitrifiers
concentrated in the surface strata. Tillage also affects the composition
of bacterial communities. Agricultural burning leads to loss of
organic matter and the liberation of P and other cations. Soil
pH increases, and there are often increases in soil microbes,
N mineralization, and nitrification, although nitrifiers and N
availability can be reduced. Burning is often accompanied by tillage,
so effects are often compounded, or confounded, in practice.<BR>
<P>
Tillage of virgin lands causes slow decline in soil organic matter.
In studies at Rothamsted Experiment Station, England, tillage
of &quot;prairie&quot; led to a decline in soil C for 27 years,
then a stabilization for the subsequent 100 years. The scientists
postulated the existence of a persistent and a labile fraction
of the total soil carbon. The former was believed to persist for
1,000 years or more, whereas the latter was believed to have a
half-life of about 10-15 years. Soil N and C are both contained
in organic matter; hence the close relationship observed between
their concentrations. Tillage, in prompting the accelerated breakdown
of soil organic matter, can liberate N in excess of that assimilable
by the soil microbes. This excess is then lost through plant uptake,
leaching, or volatilization.<BR>
<P>
Reduced-tillage (RT) typically supplies less N than does conventional
tillage.  Several explanatory hypotheses have been advanced:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Under RT, denitrification potential of the microbial community
is greater (some results have contradicted this idea; also, greater
water content may be responsible rather than tillage per se);
<LI>Concentration of residues at the surface under RT may lead
to a greater immobilization of N relative to nitrification;
<LI>Possible higher leaching losses under RT;
<LI>Impairment of root metabolism due to impaired oxygen availability
in soils under RT; and
<LI>RT systems may require several years to reach equilibrium
(as organic matter accumulates), at which point nitrification
may be much greater than that observed earlier. Such a trend has
been shown in a study of a 16-year old RT system.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
(Reviewer's note: Sims makes no mention of increased volatilization
of ammonia under RT, to which many researchers now ascribe the
reduced N availability.)<BR>
<P>
Long-term changes under tillage appear related to gradual decline
in soil organic matter, rather than to cultural practices per
se. Tillage of virgin soils results in accelerated degradation
of organic matter and consequent deterioration of soil structure
with the increased threat of erosion. Erosion can lead to decreased
microbial activity through further loss of organic matter and
exposure of inhospitable deeper horizons. Under a given farming
system, stabilization may occur with time, but reversal of the
initial degradation is unlikely. Restoration of soil microbial
communities may occur after cultivation ceases, but the recovery
time is unknown.<BR>
<H3>Microorganisms as Pollutants</H3>
<P>
Microorganisms can themselves become pollutants; particularly
hazardous are pathogens associated with livestock and waste-management
operations. Dispersal of livestock (to avoid excessive concentration),
application to lands only of treated sewage sludge, and the avoidance
of below-ground septic systems in risky areas have all proven
to be useful strategies in avoiding these problems.<BR>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
Strip mining and metal contamination are much more serious perturbations
to soil microbial communities than are the applications of pesticides.
Communities in colder regions are much more prone to long-term
disruption than those in warmer climates. Remediation of damage
may require long periods of time, and damaged sites that return
to relatively healthy status may not return to their pristine
states. Remediation usually begins with ceasing the perturbation.
long-term studies are required to test any proposed safe alternatives
to current practices.<BR>

<H1><U><I>From the Director</I> </U><I>- </I>Hungry In California
</H1>
<P>
We often see on television or read in newspapers and magazines
of the plight of hungry children in countries other than the United
States.  We pride ourselves on being the best fed nation on Earth.
 Yet, recent reports indicate that there are many hungry children
in the Central Valley of California.  (See Resources, p.7.)  There
are probably also hungry children in most California cities.<BR>
<P>
How is it that the most productive agricultural state in the nation
has hungry people, particularly in areas where the food is produced?
 How can farmworkers and their children go to bed hungry?  I do
not know the answers to these questions, but the fact that they
exist indicates that the issue of hunger needs to be addressed
if our society wants children to have a chance to develop to their
potential.   Individual farmers and citizen groups in the agricultural
community have taken steps to distribute crop gleanings, which
is commendable.  The rest of us in agriculture must help solve
the problem on a larger scale, to eliminate the very idea of hunger
in a state where agriculture is still the largest industry.  In
both the short-and the long-run it is humane and it makes good
business sense to have well-fed children.  By addressing the problem
of hunger, we will be following Governor <B>Pete Wilson's</B>
philosophy of preventive strategies to solve society's problems.
 By helping children grow and thrive, we are increasing our own
agricultural markets in a positive way, and living in a truly
sustainable agricultural community.  If we address the issue of
hunger, everyone wins.  If we do not, everyone loses.  <I>-Bill

<H1>SAREP Funds 22 New Projects for $350,000<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Twenty-two projects focusing on sustainable agriculture - ranging
from post-harvest fungicide alternatives to labor comparisons
of agricultural production systems - have been awarded $350,000<I>
</I>in grant money from the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program (SAREP), according to <B>Bill  Liebhardt</B>,
extension specialist and director of the program.<BR>
<P>
The statewide sustainable agriculture program was created by the
California Legislature in 1986 to address issues facing California
agriculture: increasing environmental concerns, food and worker
safety, and fluctuating producer profitability. The program funds
research and distributes information on sustainable farming practices.
<BR>
<P>
UC SAREP has spent $1.2 million dollars on 51 sustainable agriculture
research and education projects since 1987.<BR>
<P>
Projects funded this month include: <BR>

<LI>a method for estimating the rate of inorganic nitrogen release
from organic fertilizers. A frequent feature of sustainable agriculture
systems is the use of animal manures or other organic nitrogen-containing
materials in place of petroleum-derived nitrogen fertilizers.
But currently only the crudest methods  exist for calculating
nitrogen fertilizer value of organic materials. The objective
of this project is to develop and test a practical method for
predicting the rate at which nitrogen found in manures or composts
is converted to usable forms for plant growth. Investigators:
Stuart Pettygrove, land, air and water resources, UC Davis; Ken
Cassman, agronomy and range science, UC Davis; Richard Smith,

<UL>
<LI>case studies of controlled grazing systems. Traditional, &quot;eat-it-all-today&quot;
grazing practices are inefficient energy and production systems
that also have adverse environmental impacts, including soil erosion,
habitat destruction and weed invasions. This project will evaluate
and document operational efficiency and profitability of controlled
grazing systems on six family ranches and on University of California
field stations. This information will be useful to the 38 million
acres of range and pasture lands in California, one-third of the
state's land area. SAREP funding will be used to add an additional

<LI>nematode control in carrots using microbial and natural materials.
California's vegetable industry is mainly dependent on one pre-plant
fumigant (Telone) for nematode control, and would suffer major
losses in yield and quality if it is taken off the market or severely
restricted.  This project will evaluate the use of biologically-derived
and naturally occurring products to manage nematodes in summer
planted carrots on both conventional and organic farming operations
to determine possible alternatives to Telone. Investigators: John
Guerard, farm advisor, Kern County; John Radewald, nematology,
UC Riverside; Pete Goodell, UC Integrated Pest Management (1PM)

<UL>
<LI>effect of rice straw incorporation and green manure cropping
on rice nitrogen nutrition, stem rot incidence and soil tilth.
Most California rice growers depend on commercial nitrogen fertilizer,
and dispose of rice straw by burning. Restrictions on field burning,
fertilizer price increases, and farmer interest in soil improvement
and organic rice production methods have raised questions about
green manures (crops grown to be incorporated into cash crop for
soil enhancement) and straw incorporation and the interaction
of these two practices. This project will continue a 15-acre experiment
to determine nitrogen nutrition and soil tilth effects of green
manuring with purple vetch. Investigators: Stuart Pettygrove,
land, air and water resources, UC Davis; Jim Hill, agronomy and
range science, UC Davis; Shrinivasa Upadhyaya, agricultural engineering,

<UL>
<LI>comparison of conventional, integrated pest management, and
organic apple production systems. Low returns in apple production
caused by consumer response to reports of Alar residue in apple
products has motivated a search for production alternatives. This
project will compare conventional, organic and IPM systems in
apples for economic performance, horticultural characteristics,
biological and chemical nitrogen supply systems, and levels of
beneficial insects and pest damage. Investigators: Paul Vossen,
farm advisor, Sonoma County; Desmond Jolly, agricultural economics,
UC Davis; Roland Meyer, land, air, water resources, UC Davis;
Kate Burroughs, pest control consultant, Sonoma County; Sue Blodgett,

used in almond orchards. Nitrate pollution in groundwater is of
increasing concern in California, particularly in nitrate-sensitive
areas including Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties. This project
will establish research plots in mature almond orchards with differing
soil texture and compare nitrate movement below the root zone
for different fertilization practices. Management guidelines will
be developed to reduce the potential for nitrate pollution. Investigators:
Steven Weinbaum, Robert Carlson, Patrick Brown, and Warren Micke,
pomology, UC Davis; David Goldhamer, land, air and water resources,
UC Davis. Farmer cooperators in Stanislaus County will be identified.
$25,000<I> </I>for first year.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the feasibility of using manure and other selected practices
in organic and conventional cropping systems. Use of manure as
fertilizer for most cultivated agriculture has been avoided due
to concerns that quantities required would be huge and costly.
But there is now evidence that California has a net surplus of
cow manure. The first part of this project will look at the costs
and benefits of manure fertilizer. The second part will calculate
the costs of production and economic analysis of other practices
in whole farm production systems. Investigators for part one:
Karen Klonsky, agricultural economics, UC Davis; Richard Smith,
farm advisor, San Benito County; Stuart Pettygrove, land, air,
water resources, UC Davis. For part two: Karen Klonsky; Roberta
Cook, agricultural economics, UC Davis. Farmer cooperators will

<H1>ORGANIC FARMERS' METHODS AND PRACTICES</H1>
<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, UC SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Every year California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF), one of
the largest organic certification organizations in North America,
collects information about its members.  The annual documentation
and inspection of every farm in the program includes listing and
verifying all methods and materials used in the production and
handling of crops and livestock produced.  SAREP funded a project
that is analyzing CCOF's storehouse of information in order to
produce a profile of California organic farmers.  One of the main
goals of the project, &quot;Organic Farmers' Methods and Practices:
 A Profile of Organic Farming Systems in California,&quot; is
to identify production problems and their organic solutions. 
The information will be useful for both farmers and researchers.
 Principal investigators <B>Brian Baker, Mark Lipson</B>, and<B>
Susanne Altermann</B> are also evaluating the CCOF certification
database as a research tool.<BR>
<P>
The project was funded by SAREP for $11,350 from May 1988 through
June 1990, and was extended through June 1991 with an additional
$5,363<I> </I>grant.  Additional support was provided by the Strong
Foundation, the Organic Farming Research Foundation and CCOF.
<H3>Highlights</H3>
<P>
Investigators can make only a few generalizations about organic
farm management as a whole based on 1989 data analyzed so far.
 Data show that cover cropping is widely used as a primary technique
of soil fertility management.  The relative absence of insect
and disease problems stands out for both apples and tomatoes,
crops that were profiled in detail.<BR>
<P>
Researchers concluded that the CCOF certification database represents
a valuable storehouse of raw data.  &quot;It is a significant
descriptive tool which can provide the basis for formulating and
testing hypotheses about the efficacy and profitability of specific
farming practices,&quot; they wrote.
<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
Data on organic farming practices was collected on 476 farms during
the 1989 CCOF certification process.  The data includes specific
management practices or materials used by each farm, and relates
each practice or material to a pest problem or &quot;management
objective&quot; like soil fertility.  General statistics were
compiled for the grower population as a whole, including farm
size, location and basic soil fertility management.  Fertility
inputs were further characterized by source.  Apples and tomatoes
were selected for detailed profiles of production practices and
problems.  More than 7,200 entries were made to the growing practices
database in 1989.  Data from 1990 is now being entered.
<H3>Profile of Organic Farming in California</H3>
<P>
CCOF's membership of 522<I> </I>farms in 1989 was estimated to
represent 50 to 60 percent of the state's organic farming operations
in both numbers and acreage.  Average farm size was 83.29 acres.
 Figure 1 shows the breakdown of acreage by crop.<BR>
<H3>Profile of Soil Fertility Management Practices</H3>
<P>
One interesting fact the project revealed was the number of farmers
who use cover crops, Baker said.  &quot;There's some debate about
the value of cover crops,&quot; he noted, &quot;But better than
half of the farmers are using them.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Cover crops are used by 56 percent of all CCOF farms, 51 percent
of apple growers, and 62 percent of tomato growers.<BR>
<P>
Soil management practices reported varied according to crop and
local condition.  Three main sources of basic fertility management
available to organic farmers are compost, cover crops and manure.
 Figure 2 shows the frequency with which these practices were
reported.<BR>
<P>
Many farms use more than one method.  Of the growers reporting
for 1989, 226 reported the use of compost, while 195 used manure
for the fertility management.  An additional 270 used cover crops.
 There were 91 growers who used none of the three methods, many
because they were in transition and had not yet developed a soil
management program.  Some relied on rock minerals, drip or foliar
feeds.  The researchers note that the remainder could be classified
as &quot;organic by neglect.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<I>Compost</I>.  Sources of compost varied widely.  Most compost
was produced &quot;on-farm&quot; with products obtained &quot;off-farm.&quot;
 About one-quarter of all CCOF growers made compost.  Commonly
listed ingredients include manure, crop residues and vegetative
matter.  A number of farms used biodynamic or microbiological
inoculents for their compost piles.  Rock phosphate, gypsum and
limestone were also used  in compost.  Approximately sixty off-farm
suppliers provide compost to CCOF growers.  Most suppliers are
livestock producers who make compost as a sideline.  Some are
trucking companies or retailers who broker products composted
by other operations.<BR>
<P>
<I>Manure.</I>  Manure was listed as a soil amendment by 195 farms.
 This included the use of raw, aged, sheet-composted or partially
decomposed manure.  Chicken manure was the primary category. 
Most manure was obtained off-farm; much of it was mixed with other
material or partially composted before being used (see Figure
3).  A number of growers said that they were cutting down or eliminating
the use of raw manure due to its salinity, weed seeds, variability,
and difficulty in handling.  (CCOF standards restrict the use
of raw manure.)<BR>
<P>
<I>Cover Crops.</I>  Cover Crops were used by 270 CCOF farms.
 Data from 1989 show cover crops are used by 56 percent of all
CCOF farms, 51 percent of apple growers, and 62 percent of tomato
growers.  The use and reporting of cover crops varied widely,
as some growers were experimenting with several types and listed
up to six different cover crops and seed mixes.  Others used cover
crops for specific situations, for example, different cover crops
for orchard, summer open ground and winter open ground.  Some
gave specific varieties, while others provided only generic information.
<BR>
<P>
Table 1 is a summary of the most widely used cover crops.  Vetch
 is the number one choice, with purple vetch the most commonly
cited variety.  Vetch is often used in a mix, most frequently
with barley, bell beans, clover, oats, peas and/or rye.  The most
popular mix used by CCOF growers includes bell beans, Austrian
winter peas and vetch, followed by bell beans, clover and vetch.
<BR>
<P>
Growers on 38 farms also referred to various forms of resident
vegetation, or weeds, as a 'cover.'  Resident vegetation most
frequently listed as beneficial included bur clover, lupine, mustard
and native grasses.  Most established long-term organic producers
had planned rotations that included cover crops.<BR>
<P>
Cover crop varied widely.  Table 1 shows that variation.<BR>

Investigators noted that perennial crop producers showed less
variation in their selection and management of cover crops.  Selection
depended less on the season and more on whether the cover competed
with weeds, and not the crop.  Permanent covers and reseeding
varieties were also popular.  Once a cover crop has been established,
the amount of management time declines, investigators noted.
<H3>Apples, Tomatoes Profiled</H3>
<P>
Apple and tomato production problems and practices were profiled
in detail.  Investigators reviewed soil management practices,
insect pests, preventive practices, diseases, and weed control
for the two crops.  Extensive information and more than 20 tables
of information were compiled from the CCOF database and are available
from the addresses noted at the end of this article.  Of special
note: 31 percent of apple growers reported no insect problems
and 64 percent reported no disease problems; 53 percent of tomato
reported no insect problems, while 47 percent reported no disease
problems.  (Most of the operations that reported no insect problems
were mixed fruit and vegetable operations where apples were not
the predominant crop grown.  Operations that were monoculture
apples were the hardest hit by insect problems.)
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
Baker noted that in addition to continuing data entry and analysis,
the project will continue to grow and include more in-depth analyses
of specific issues.<BR>
<P>
&quot;There are regional barriers to the adoption of organic practices,&quot;
he said.  &quot;It's hard to tease them out of the data.&quot;
 For example, in the regions with little animal production, manure
is limited.  Growers in those regions may use more cover crops
rather than compost.  &quot;Conversely, some areas might have
a terrible water shortage and very little ability to irrigate
a cover crop.  We can break that out regionally or by practices,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<P>
Baker said farmers will find systems analysis of the data even
more helpful than individual crop analysis because very few organic
farmers grow just one crop.<BR>
<P>
&quot;But we need to develop some protocol for looking at these
systems and the interactions between crops, &quot;he said.  &quot;We
haven't done any real statistics with this data.  We've got rough
sketches of what's going on the farm, but we haven't been able
to go in depth, given our limited time and budget.&quot;<BR>
<P>
He said another goal of the project is to study the transition
to organic farming practices.  &quot;We'd like to look at growers'
practices over time.  In the next phase of the study we might
look at growers who were in their first year of organic production
in 1989 and compare that data to their growing practices in 1990.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
Baker said the project is &quot;identifying the production problems
and some of the solutions to those problems that have historically
prevented farmers from adopting organic techniques.&quot;  As
the data analysis continues, he noted, farmers and researchers
will receive more useful information.<BR>

<P>
Thirty-six research and education projects have been granted a
total of $203,430 by UC SAREP in the 1995/96 funding cycle, according
to <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B>, SAREP director. New projects were chosen
in four different areas: community development and public policy,
production, educational events, and graduate student awards. A
brief description of the projects, principal investigators and
amounts awarded for the first year follows.<BR>

<A NAME="community"></A><H3>Community Development and Public Policy Projects<BR>
(6 Projects; $51,699)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Patricia Allen</B> and <B>Jackelyn Lundy</B>, Center for
Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UC Santa Cruz, &quot;Food
Security in Santa Cruz, California: Building a Foundation for
Community Action&quot;: $8,560. This project will focus on the
city of Santa Cruz and its issues of food security, which means
the ability of community members to have a secure, culturally
acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through local non-emergency
sources within a viable, environmentally sound agricultural system.
This will be addressed by research, policy analysis, community
networking and publications to support the development of a local
food policy council. Guided by an advisory committee of local
stakeholders and food policy experts, the investigators will prepare
a report on food security in Santa Cruz, including who is most
at risk nutritionally and why.
<P><LI><B>Joyce M. Ewen</B>, Pomona-Inland Valley Council of Churches,
&quot;PIVCC's Food Security Project&quot;: $5,000. This project
will increase food security by building the capacity of a low-income
neighborhood to produce its own food, increase knowledge and practice
of good nutrition, and expand accessibility of fresh, locally
grown food. The collaborative project will link several key organizations
to create solutions for hunger issues and long-term food security.
<P><LI><B>Santos Gomez</B>, Pacific Institute for Studies in Development,
Environment and Security, &quot;Using Water Transfers to Promote
Sustainable Rural Development&quot;: $11,000. This project will
determine the conditions under which water transfers can promote
the health and sustainability of rural communities. Working collaboratively
with farmer and farmworker organizations, rural community leaders,
and other researchers, the investigators will determine where
water transfers could generate significant positive or negative
impacts and identify policy alternatives for water transfers that
encourage sustainable rural development.
<P><LI><B>Robert Gottlieb</B>, Urban Planning, UCLA, &quot;Expanding
Direct Marketing Opportunities for Community Development and to
Reduce Pesticide Use&quot;: $10,139. This continuing project will
complete a feasibility study of a &quot;Market Basket&quot; program
in which farmers who sell at farmers' markets use a new marketing
arrangement resembling community supported agriculture. Demonstration
projects will be launched in two low- and middle- income communities
with large minority populations, one in Southwest and one in East
Los Angeles.
<P><LI><B>Sharon Junge</B>, Placer County Cooperative Extension Office,
&quot;Impacts of Local Food Systems on Communities and Agriculture/Reason
for the Seasons...Increasing Sustainable Practices Among Consumers&quot;:
$10,000. This continuing project is encouraging greater purchasing
and production of local agricultural products to create a more
stable and sustainable community. The investigators are working
with a grassroots agricultural marketing association, PlacerGROWN,
to educate consumers on the benefits of purchasing locally produced,
processed and distributed food that is geared to seasonal availability.
<P><LI><B>Sibella Kraus</B>, Center for Urban Education about Sustainable
Agriculture, &quot;Market Cooking for Kids: Developing Children's
Consciousness of Regional Sustainable Agriculture&quot;: $7,000.
This project is an innovative cooking and science program for
children in Bay Area public schools which combines hands-on education
about the biology and production of local seasonal foods with
basic cooking instruction about how to appreciate and prepare
these foods. The program will reach almost 500 children, primarily
from low-income backgrounds and will be a year-long collaborative
effort among the school district, restaurants, produce businesses,
farmers' markets, and regional farms.

<A NAME="production"></A><H3>Production Projects<BR>
(11 projects; $128,481)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Roger Ingram</B>, Placer-Nevada counties farm advisor,
&quot;Controlled Grazing on Foothill Rangelands&quot;: $21,500.
This project will address the expressed needs of Northern California
livestock producers for research-based information on controlled
grazing and sustainable livestock production practices. It will
also demonstrate how land owners and ranchers can monitor the
effects of these practices so they can decide for themselves whether
controlled grazing is appropriate for their business. The project
will also address public concerns about the environmental impacts
of grazing.
<P><LI><B>Rob Atwill</B>, UC Davis Veterinary Medicine Teaching and
Research Center, Tulare CA, &quot;Assessing the Environmental
Risk from Rangeland Cattle Shedding Cryptosporidium parvum in
their Feces&quot;: $7,966. Large municipal water-borne outbreaks
of Cryptosporidium-induced gastroenteritis in humans has raised
questions among ranchers, government regulators and watershed
managers as to whether cattle grazing is a leading source of this
pathogen and how best to equitably minimize its possible impacts.
This project will determine whether and under what conditions
eggs of the pathogen shed in the feces of rangeland beef cattle
can survive the ambient temperatures typical of California rangeland
from spring through fall.
<IMG SRC = "IMG00001.GIF" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5>
<P><LI><B>Larry Forero</B>, Shasta-Trinity counties farm advisor,
&quot;History of Livestock Grazing on the Shasta-Trinity Forest:
Implications for the Future&quot;: $5,000. Historical documents
indicate that livestock grazing in Shasta, Siskiyou, and Trinity
counties has decreased from 90,000 animal unit months (aum: amount
one cow with a calf eats per month) during the 1930s to about
9,400 currently. This study will reconstruct the history of grazing
in the Shasta Trinity National Forest and determine the causes
for this reduction of grazing activity. The data could be used
to demonstrate how reduction in livestock grazing on public land
translates to private land use decisions.
<P><LI><B>Bruce Jaffee</B>, Nematology, UC Davis, &quot;Suppression
of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes in Conventional and Organic Farming
Systems&quot;: $9,000. This is the second year of a study in which
soils from conventional and organic farming systems are being
examined for their suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes.
The project will be conducted at the Sustainable Agriculture Farming
Systems project at UC Davis.
<P><LI><B>Steve Temple</B>, Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;A Comparison of Conventional, Low Input and Organic Farming
Systems: The Transition Phase and Long-Term Viability&quot;: $37,500.
The <A HREF="http://agronomy.ucdavis.edu/safs/">Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems</A>
 project at UC Davis,
now in its eighth year, compares four farming systems with varying
levels of dependence on external resources over a 12-year period.
<P><LI><B>Ford Denison</B>, Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;Rotation Length and Organic Transitions&quot;: $7,000. An
additional four-year organic rotation was added last year to the
Long Term Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) project at
UC Davis. SAREP provided the start-up money for this 100-year
long-term farmland research experiment in 1990. This part of the
LTRAS project will continue to evaluate two-year and four-year
rotation length and will assess the contributions of soil quality
and human factors in the transition to organic farming.
<P><LI><B>Steven Koike</B>, Monterey County farm advisor, &quot;Determination
of the Effect of Cover Crops on Lettuce Drop Disease&quot;: $3,540.
This is the second year of a study that will determine the ability
of cover crop residues to reduce lettuce drop disease. Another
objective of the study is to determine the effects of compost
on populations of the lettuce drop pathogen.
<P><LI><B>Krishna Subbarao</B>, Plant Pathology Specialist, U.S.
Agricultural Research Station, Salinas, &quot;Subsurface Drip
Irrigation for Soilborne Disease Management in Lettuce&quot;:
$8,000. In the first year of this study, the use of subsurface
drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation was shown to reduce
the incidence of lettuce drop and the severity of corky root,
two serious diseases of lettuce in the Salinas Valley. Also, yields
were higher under drip irrigation. The second year of the study
will continue with the same objectives to verify the results and
will include fungicide-sprayed vs. unsprayed subplots.
<P><LI><B>Jay Rosenheim</B>, Entomology, UC Davis, &quot;Ecology
of a Group of Generalist Predators, the Green Lacewings, and their
Contribution to Biological Control in Almonds and Walnuts&quot;:
$8,000. This project seeks to develop an improved understanding
of the ecology of green lacewings, one of the dominant groups

evaluate whether releases have the potential to substantially
augment natural populations, and will determine the optimum timing

Postharvest Treatments for Decay and Insect Control&quot;: $13,000.
Consumer demand for pesticide-free produce is increasing while
consumers also continue to expect insect-free and decay-free products.
This project will evaluate the two important benign postharvest
treatments, high carbon dioxide atmospheres and heat therapy,
for their effects on decay and insect control on grapes, pears,
leafy greens, tomatoes, and peppers.

applied pesticide for Pacific mite on grapes is effective, it
has a 30-day reentry period and is scheduled for cancellation
due to regulatory changes. This project will evaluate the effects
of narrow range summer oil, which has a 12-hour reentry period,
on Pacific mite and predator mite populations in comparison with
the standard mite treatment.

<P>
Tremendous strides this century in agricultural science and technology
have not made traditional, small, family farms obsolete. In fact,
60,000 small farms in California produce crops valued at roughly
$1 billion using sophisticated production and marketing systems.
<P>
These innovations are the hallmark of the annual California Farm
Conference, which this year brings farmers, farmers' market managers,
ag consultants and other members of the ag industry from all over
the state to the Radisson Hotel and Convention Center in Visalia.
Three days of workshops, tours, speakers and special events at
the conference all focus on sustaining farm profitability.
<P>
&quot;Operating a successful farm requires many special skills
and abilities,&quot; says conference coordinator <B>David Visher</B>,
program representative for the University of California's Small
Farm Program. &quot;These talents-including an intimate understanding
of land and crops, market intuition and familiarity with new ag
technology-are nowhere more important than on small, family farms.&quot;
<P>
The conference begins Sunday, Feb. 18, 1996 with optional tours
and short courses, and formally opens that evening with a reception
featuring California wine, food grown by local farmers and dishes
prepared by local restaurant chefs.
<P>
&quot;The tasting offers participants the chance to taste some
of the best food in the region, and perhaps more importantly,
it helps connect the produce harvested on farms with the food
on consumers' tables,&quot; Visher says. The agenda Monday and
Tuesday, Feb. 19 and 20, features nationally known keynote speakers
and nearly 40 workshops. The workshops focus on four themes: marketing,
production, sustainability and farm management.
<P>
 &quot;The workshops offer a wide variety of information, everything
from improving soil fertility and using cover crop systems, to
selling produce to restaurants and wholesale distributors,&quot;
Visher says. &quot;Participants can tailor the conference to their
needs by selecting the workshops of their choice.&quot;
<P>
Keynote speakers include <B>Mas Masumoto</B>, a Dinuba farmer
and the celebrated author of <I>Epitaph for a Peach</I>, and <B>Marty
Strange</B>, program director and co-founder of the Center for
Rural Affairs in Walthill, Nebraska. The Center is devoted to
the economic, social and environmental well being of rural America.
<P>
Basic conference registration is $95. For more information, call
the California Federation of Certified Farmers' Markets at (818)
449-0179 to request a registration packet. <FONT FACE="ZapfDingbats">n</FONT>

Adapted from Plant Protection Quarterly 3(3,4): 13. 1993<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I>Editor's Note: A summary of this research, along with 18 other
abstracts, appears in the recently published Cover Crops Workgroup
Report. This report was compiled for the recent Workgroup meeting.
For information on obtaining this report see page 15 of this newsletter.
As noted above, the article originally appeared in the Plant Protection
Quarterly, a publication by UC pest management specialists and
advisors. <BR>
</I>
<P>
For the past 50 years farmers have been able to use synthetic
chemical fumigants to disinfest soil of pest and disease organisms.
These materials have been effective and easy to apply. The cost
of fumigant treatments has usually been recouped through dramatically
higher yield and quality of produce, healthier and longer-lived
permanent crops, certification of pathogen-free nursery stock,
and reduced costs of other production practices such as weed control
(Chen et al., 1991). <BR>

<P>
In the current climate of strict environmental and human safety
regulations, however, it appears that the era of widespread disinfestation
of agricultural soils by synthetic chemical fumigants is coming
to a close. Alternative methods of soil disinfestation must be
developed and implemented if current levels of crop production,
quality, and phytosanitary certification are to be maintained.
One such method is soil solarization. Heat accumulation in solarized
soil causes physical, biological, and chemical changes which normally
result in greatly reduced pest and pathogen numbers and increased
yield in subsequent crops. Disadvantages of solarization include
dependence on favorable climatic and weather conditions, treating
soil for several weeks during the growing season, lack of control
of certain heat tolerant pests, and generally, decreased efficacy
with increasing soil depth (Chen et al., 1991). <BR>

<P>
Another alternative for disinfesting soil is to incorporate into
the soil fertilizers and plant residues that have pesticidal properties.
This practice has received renewed attention, and numerous studies
have shown that amending soil with various cover crops, plant
residues and extracts, animal manures and composts, and inorganic
fertilizers can provide some degree of pesticidal activity (Rodriguez-Kabana,
1986). Studies in which soil sealing and/or heating with plastic
mulches was combined with soil amendments generally concluded
that, like fumigants, levels of soil disinfestation were better
than with either method alone (Brown et al., 1989; Gamliel and
Stapleton, 1993a; Gamliel and Stapleton, 1993b; Ramirez-Villapudua
and Munnecke, 1988; Stapleton et al., 1991). <BR>

<P>
This article summarizes recent experiments done with combinations
of composts, inorganic fertilizers, or cruciferous residues and
solarization with polyethylene film or liquid spray mulch to test
improved pathogen control, and to determine relationships of soil
heating and sealing on concentrations of biotoxic volatile compounds
emanating from treated soil. <BR>

<H3>Recent Research</H3>

<P>
<B>Solarization and fertilizers</B>. Laboratory and field experiments
in different soil types were done in 1991 and 1992 near Fresno,
California, to determine the effects of organic and inorganic
nitrogen sources. Commercially-composted chicken manure and inorganic
ammonium-nitrogen were applied at rates equivalent to 80 kg NH4-N
per hectare with and without soil solarization with clear polyethylene
film. The length of the treatment was four weeks during August
1991. Measurements were taken on fungal (<I>Pythium ultimum</I>)
and nematode (<I>Meloidogyne incognita</I>) pathogens in the rhizosphere
and roots of lettuce (<I>Lactuca sativa</I> cv. Parris Island).
<BR>

<P>
<B>Solarization and crop residues or fertilizers.</B> Another
replicated field experiment was done in sandy loam soil near Fresno,
in 1993 to compare the effects of amending soil with composted
chicken manure (40 kg NH4-N per ha) or dried cabbage harvest residues
(500 kg per ha), with and without a four-week period of soil solarization.
Solarized soils were treated in July 1992, with either clear polyethylene
film or black spray mulch; data were collected on the survival
of <I>P. ultimum</I>. <BR>

<P>
<B>Evolution of volatile compounds from amended and heated soil</B>.
Additional experiments were conducted in the laboratory to analyze
evolution of volatile compounds by gas chromatography from soil
amended with cabbage residues under various levels of soil heating,
and to correlate the presence of these compounds with pathogen
control.<BR>

<H3>Results and Discussion</H3>

<P>
<B>Solarization and fertilizers</B>. Preplant incorporation of
ammonium phosphate fertilizer or composted chicken manure slightly
reduced galling of lettuce roots by M. incognita (3-24%); solarization
was more effective (74% reduction). Ammonium phosphate combined
with solarization was no better than solarization alone, but compost
plus solarization reduced nematode galling to undetectable levels
(figure 1). With regard to <I>P. ultimum</I>, incorporating fertilizer
or compost alone reduced propagule numbers in lettuce rhizosphere
by 0 to 25 percent; solarization alone reduced their number by
80 to 100 percent. Due to the high activity of solarization, combination
with soil amendments did not give increased control (figure 1).
<BR>

<P>
<B>Solarization and crop residues or fertilizers</B>. In this
experiment, neither soil amendment had a fungicidal effect when
used alone. Solarization with polyethylene film or spray mulch,
on the other hand, was very effective, resulting in reduction
of fungal propagules ranging from 82 to 100 percent. No interaction
was found between soil amendments and solarization. <BR>

<P>
<B>Evolution of volatile compounds from amended and heated soil</B>.
Relative concentrations of several volatile compounds emanating
from cabbage-amended soil were increased by soil heating. These
compounds included various alcohols, aldehydes, isothiocyanates,
and sulfides. Others (e.g., CO<SUB>2</SUB>) were generally higher
in nonheated soil. The levels of isothiocyanates and aldehydes
generated in heated soil were significantly correlated with reduced
propagule numbers of <I>P. ultimum</I>. Both soil heating and
amendment with cabbage residue and chicken compost increased the
lethal effect on <I>P. ultimum</I>. <BR>

<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>
Results of these experiments indicate that sealing animal and
plant residues containing biotoxic volatile compounds into soil
and using materials such as polyethylene film and spray mulch
can provide at least partial soil disinfestation, especially when
combined with soil heating. Under present laws, use of these soil
amendments, even when intended for pesticidal activity, do not
carry regulatory requirements when the materials are produced
on-farm. However, additional research will be necessary to develop
guidelines for optimal usage. As interest and experimental results
increase, it may be possible to develop &quot;customized&quot;
soil amendments. which will have greater activity on specific
pest organisms found in particular fields. Crop managers will
require more intensive soil sampling to identify and enumerate
threshold levels of soilborne pests as the broad spectrum fumigants
become unavailable. <BR>

<H1>Should the Food System be Decentralized?</H1>
<P>
<I>by Gail Feenstra, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I> (Editor's Note: <B>Gail Feenstra</B>, SAREP writer and nutritionist,
was a speaker at the Fourth National Conference on Organic Sustainable
Agriculture Policies sponsored by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest and the Institute for Alternative Agriculture
in Washington, DC in February 1992.  The following article is
adapted from her speech.)<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
I have spent a good deal of time thinking about the topic of decentralizing
the food system, both as a nutritionist and in my work at the
University of California's Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program.  I would like to share with you some of my
ideas about why I think it is essential that we begin working
toward a more decentralized food system.<BR>
<P>
Let me start by describing a couple of scenarios.  In the first,
agricultural production has become more and more centralized,
with land and capital concentrated into the hands of fewer, larger
landholders.  Many of these farms are highly specialized, growing
mainly one crop.  Small family farms are quietly disappearing,
replaced by quickly expanding suburban developments, or in some
regions, impoverished rural towns.  These towns are the first
to notice that toxic agricultural chemicals have begun to infiltrate
their water supply, or that leukemia begins to strike some of
their children.  Yet, they are told not to worry because their
agriculture and food systems are the safest, the most productive
and efficient in the world.  All kinds of produce are now available
year-round and food is relatively cheap at the supermarkets. 
Some people complain that the food doesn't have much flavor. 
Eventually, they begin to forget what produce used to taste like
or how it was grown.<BR>
<P>
In the second scenario, the food system is more decentralized.
 There are many more family farms on the landscape, particularly
in certain farming regions of the country.  These farms would
be closely linked with nearby rural communities, supporting the
economic, educational, and cultural vitality within those communities.
 Food distribution networks and food processing industries would
be closely connected to nearby food production so that consumers
in local communities and cities would benefit from the freshest,
locally produced foods in season.  Food producing resources- 
  land, water, technologies, marketing, processing and distribution
networks-are much more democratically controlled and equitably
distributed among many individuals.<BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the trends in our present food system are much
more similar to the first scenario than the second.  Do we want
to continue in this direction?  I would like to suggest that we
do not and that we can go a lot further toward making our food
system more localized, more democratic, and more accountable.
<BR>
<P>
Now that I have given you a few preliminary ideas of what I think
a more decentralized food system might look like, I want to put
it into perspective by identifying a premise or goal that undergirds
this vision of a more decentralized food system.  That goal is
the creation of a more sustainable food system.  By sustainable,
I mean, one that is environmentally sound, economically profitable
and socially just and humane.  Moving toward a more decentralized
food system is absolutely necessary to achieving that goal of
sustainability because a more decentralized system provides the
necessary environment for a sustainable food system to flourish.
 Let me describe why.<BR>
<P>
First, our current, more centralized system is highly dependent
on fossil fuel inputs for machinery, fertilizers, pesticides,
irrigation, food processing and distribution.  Fossil fuel inputs
have increased dramatically over the last several decades so that
today, we put 9.8 kilocalories of fossil fuel energy into our
food system for every one kilocalorie of food energy we get out.
<BR>
<P>
In a more decentralized food system, production sites would be
closer to communities where foods will be consumed, thus, transportation
is reduced considerably.  A 1985 study of potential local markets
for fresh California produce found, using a computer model, that
distribution of produce in a decentralized model could save one-third
of the transportation cost ($13- $16 million annually) and one-fourth
of the fuel compared to the centralized distribution network that
we now have. Others have pointed out that shorter transportation
in a more decentralized food system may also allow growers to
reduce insecticides, fungicides or other post-harvest chemicals
(derived from fossil fuels).  This may be possible if we also
rethink the cosmetic quality standards that are now in place such
that they begin to reflect local markets as the endpoint of produce
sales.<BR>
<P>
Second, our present centralized and concentrated food system has
eroded the democratic public participation and decision-making
about how our food is grown and distributed and by whom.  This
has had serious implications for the long-term sustainability
of our natural resources, for the viability of rural communities
and for our connection to the food supply.  Let me elaborate on
each of these implications.<BR>
<P>
As the food system has gotten more centralized, fewer landowners
actually live on and work their land, so they lose the intimate
contact that is necessary to care for the land, water and other
resources sustainably.  According to the Rural Realignment Project,
in 1982, only six percent of the farms in California took in almost
three-quarters of the state's total farm cash receipts.  Insurance
companies are one example of these concentrated holdings in agricultural
land.  The value of farm real estate held by life insurance companies
rose from $281.4 million in 1984 to $432.3 million in 1986.  Also,
tax shelters and other incentives from earlier tax laws have encouraged
absentee ownership of farmland in California.  The increasing
concentration of &quot;operating enterprises&quot; rather than
simply of &quot;ownership patterns&quot; is of particular significance.
 This trend allows and even encourages a short-term focus on resource
use.  As one small farmer recently told me, &quot;the land simply
cannot support the maximum level of production required to maintain
this corporate profit.&quot;<BR>
<P>
A more decentralized food system would encourage many small farmers
to own and live on the land, giving them the opportunity to observe
and experience the rhythm and capacity of the land and natural
resources <I>over the long term.  </I>The possibility of this
long-term focus on the stewardship of land and resources then,
encourages more environmentally sound production.<BR>
<P>
Another consequence of a centralized food system is the undemocratic
nature of water distribution in the western states.  Current water
policies have historically benefited large farm businesses to
the detriment of rural communities and the environment.  Today,
there are farm operations with more than 20,000 acres of irrigated
cropland receiving unlimited irrigation water from the Central
Valley Project at much less than the true cost.  A 1986 study
by the California Institute for Rural Studies found that the largest
13% of farms operating in ten California districts receiving subsidized
federal water, operated 62% of the acres.  Some of the largest
farms have taken advantage of loopholes in the reclamation law,
dividing up their farms on paper into many pieces, each 960 acres
(which qualify for subsidized water), yet they are all managed
as one unit.  Not only are smaller farmers disadvantaged by these
actions, but rural communities suffer.<BR>
<P>
Initially, one might suppose that the influx of capital and profits
from large-scale farming operations would eventually find its
way to the pockets of local residents, improving their economic
well-being.  Yet, research beginning in the 1940s with <B>Walter
Goldschmidt's </B>classic study of Arvin and Dinuba, to more recent
studies by Professor <B>Dean MacCannell </B>at UC Davis<B> </B>and
<B>Trudy Wischemann </B>at the California Institute for Rural
Studies, find that the advanced, industrial-type agriculture in
the sunbelt states is associated with substantial deterioration
of human living conditions in nearby rural communities.  Although
industrialization has brought benefits in terms of better technology
and economic profitability to farm owners, it is associated with
poverty for the workers and the community.  On the other hand,
in rural communities surrounded by small family farms, i.e., a
more decentralized model, economic and social conditions improve.
<BR>
<P>
The end result of our ever more centralized food system is that
people have become separated from the source of their sustenance.
 Most people have no idea where their food comes from or how it
grows or what the implications are for the sustainability of the
resource base, other humans or other living creatures.  In the
centralized model, food has been reduced to a mere commodity with
its value measured solely by market prices.  One of the most compelling
reasons then, for moving toward a decentralized food system is
to put people back in touch with their food supply by connecting
them with those that grow and harvest their food.  This will allow
people to begin to understand some of the broader environmental
and social implications of their purchasing decisions.  Only then
can we all participate in building a more sustainable food system.

<H1>Citrus Groundwater Publication Available<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Citrus growers and anyone concerned with groundwater issues will
be interested in a new SAREP publication, <I>Protecting Groundwater
Quality in Citrus Production.</I> The 40-page book was written
by <B>Chuck Ingels</B> and published by UC ANR Publications. 
<BR>

<P>
Preventing groundwater contamination from pesticides and nitrate
has become one of the most pressing environmental problems in
agriculture. The three main herbicides used in citrus production
have been found in hundreds of wells in the San Joaquin Valley.
As a result, the use of these herbicides is restricted in many
areas. Fertilizers used in citrus production can lead to nitrate
leaching, especially on the sandy soils where many citrus orchards
are located. This book offers practical and economical methods
for reducing the movement of agricultural chemicals to groundwater.
<BR>

<P>
The book details the seriousness of the groundwater contamination
problem in California, how chemicals move from farms to groundwater,
and the history of nitrogen and weed management in the state's
citrus industry. It presents diverse management strategies for
both protecting groundwater and maintaining yields and fruit quality.
Practices discussed include wellhead protection and creative techniques
for managing nitrogen, weeds, and irrigation. The book also provides
the most thorough coverage available about cover cropping in citrus.
It examines the limitations of cover cropping and suggests strategies
that can be used to overcome these drawbacks. <BR>

<P>
<I>Protecting Groundwater in citrus Production</I> can be ordered
from ANR Publications, University of California, 6701 San Pablo
Avenue, Oakland, CA 94608-1239; (510) 642-2431. The price is $5.00.

<H1>Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) for Merced
County Almond Growers<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Robert L. Bugg, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Almond growers in Merced County are needed for a new project being
developed for growers who wish to reduce the use of pesticides
and/or fertilizers. The project, known as &quot;Biologically Integrated
Orchard Systems&quot; or &quot;BIOS,&quot; is being coordinated
by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers Foundation (CAFF
Foundation) with funding provided by grants from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pew Charitable Trust. Full participation
in the project is limited to 30 farmers, many of whom will be
eligible for financial incentives. However, there will also be
field days, focus sessions, seminars and workshops open to all
interested farmers and agricultural consultants. <BR>

<P>
Many almond growers in Merced County rely on heavy applications
of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers. Ground and surface waters
may be at risk due to these practices, and increasing governmental
regulation is likely. Several growers and specialists have experiences
with BIOS that rely less on agrichemicals and more on ecological
cycles and naturally occurring feedback loops. For example, an
ongoing comparison of organic and conventional almond orchards
by Merced County farm advisor <B>Lonnie Hendricks</B> confirms
that cover crops can be an important tool in managing arthropod
pests and their natural enemies. BIOS appear to be on the cutting
edge of agricultural technology; growers can use this approach
to reduce the threat of pollution while maintaining high productivity.
<BR>

<H3>Who Qualifies, What is Required? </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Merced County almond growers who rely primarily on agrichemicals
but wish to reduce usage qualify.
<LI>Twenty to 30 acres per farm will be committed to the program
for three years as transitional parcels. 
<LI>The farmer or pest control adviser (PCA) must be willing to
monitor insects and to collect and share data on pest and beneficial
2 organisms, cover crops, soil and tree nutrient status, and yields.
The target is 20 to a maximum of 30 farms in the project.  
</UL>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></B>
<H3>Technical Support </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Farmers and their PCAs will work with a team of experienced
BIOS farmers and specialists to develop customized plans for the
transitional parcels. 
<LI>A program of pest monitoring will be developed for individual
orchards. 
<LI>A newsletter summarizing the results of the monitoring and
current field conditions will be sent weekly to participating
farmers and PCAs. 
<LI>Farmers and PCAs with experience in bio-control will be available
throughout the season to answer questions concerning the transitional
process. 
<LI>Monthly problem solving meetings will be held with farmers,
PCAs and researchers. 
<LI>On-farm workshops, seminars, and facilitated focus sessions
will be held every two months. Topics will include pest and disease
identification, cover crop management for beneficial insects,
orchard floor management, and bird management.  
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Financial Incentives </H3>

<UL>
<LI>Subsidies of up to $14 per acre for pest monitoring by pest
control advisers will be available from the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, through the Merced County Resource Conservation
District. An additional $8 per acre will be available for these
purposes through the EPA.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cost-sharing will be available through corporate sponsors
for cover crop seed, beneficial insects and mites, and insectary
shrubs and trees. Corporate sponsors include Beneficial Insectary
(Oak Run), Biotactics, Inc. (Riverside), Bo-Biotrol, Inc. (Merced),
Cornflower Farms (Elk Grove), Lohse Mill, Inc. (Artois), Germain
Seeds (Fresno), Clyde Robin Seed Company (Hayward), and Ramsey
Seed, Inc. (Manteca). 
</UL>

<H1>Fine-tuning Agricultural Systems</H1>

<P>
In the past I have discussed the need for more system-level research,
because farmers manage complex systems; I think that this need
still exists.  However, there is also a clear need for investigations
into key components of these complex production systems. This
sort of investigation may be the key to solving many of our production
related problems in California. There are numerous production
systems where component research is the key to solving particular
problems.  
<P>
For example, <B>Russell Lesteris</B> a walnut grower in Winters,
California, who like many other orchardists in the state is relying
mainly on no-till management of cover crops to meet his trees'
nitrogen needs. This general approach is seeing increasing use
in California orchards, and both plant tissue analyses and production
from most of these orchards suggest adequate nitrogen. Yet we
know few particulars about nitrogen cycling in such systems. There
have been no studies conducted to evaluate the possible benefits
from cover crop-derived nitrogen in California almond or walnut
orchards. Component research in such orchard systems could address
how cover crop species selection, soil type, irrigation system,
moving technique, and decomposer organisms influence nitrogen
dynamics. Thus, critical component research could help Russell
Lester and many other orchardists fine-tune and optimize their
management. Component and systems research methods are potentially
complementary, and whether one or the other is more appropriate
depends on the question at hand.  In both cases systems thinking
will be involved, but in the case of component research the focus
of the work is on the component.
<P>
Ecological orchardists have identified many other key research
priorities, issues that they perceive as representing limiting
factors in production.  Last winter in Ventura, at the California
Farm Conference, orchardists <B>Glenn Anderson</B>, <B>Ray Eck</B>
and<B> Fred Smeds</B> sat down and discussed some of these issues
with <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Bob Bugg</A></B> of the UC SAREP staff.  The priorities in
critical component research that they came up with included biological
and cultural control of key almond and stone fruit pathogens,
such as brown rot; issues of soil health and nutrient cycling;
management of wild solitary bees that pollinate almonds; effects
of ecological management on bloom date, nutritive value and flavor
of almonds; management of California gray field ant <I>(Formica
aerata) </I>and the wasp <I>Goniozus legneri </I>as natural enemies
of pests; alternative post-harvest sterilization techniques (e.g.
freezing or CO, treatment); and selective (soft) control measures
for the pest ants, including southern fire ant <I>(Solenopis xyloni)
</I>and pavement ant <I>(Tetramorium caespitum).</I>
<P>
In fact, many issues in sustainable production cut across commodity
boundaries, pointing up the possibility of cooperative funding
of critical component research by several commodity organizations.
 Perhaps commodity boards and public funding agencies (such as
UC SAREP) should explore joint funding approaches to get these
issues addressed.
<P>
Our public and technical advisory committees have discussed the
merit of having SAREP and commodity groups jointly sponsor such
work.  Such an approach would support commodity programs that
are attempting to move forward on some of their tough production
problems.  This work would also give us new insights into how
components can change the way systems function.  We at UC SAREP
are now exploring opportunities for these sorts of collaboration.

<I>By Luanne Warnock, SAREP</I>
<P>
Standing at the edge of a field looking far across an expanse
of corn to the horizon, the question of ownership arises: Can
what is mortal &quot;own&quot; that which is perpetual?  Many
believe that the responsibility of stewardship outweighs the power
of ownership. While ownership confers the right to do as one pleases
with what one owns, stewardship suggests that despite ownership
rights there is an incumbent duty to temper one's pleasure with
a consideration for others-both those present and those yet to
come.
<P>
In 1994 SAREP funded a project based on ideas such as these, designed
by a group in Covelo, Mendocino County. which want-ed to create
a model for conserving and protecting agricultural land. Specific
issues the project aimed to address were: <BR>
1) the preservation of farmland from conversion to non-agricultural
development and housing uses; 2) the promotion of biological/sustainable
farming practices that would enhance biological life and the integrity
of agricultural soils; and 3) eliminating the speculative value
of farmland so that it becomes and remains affordable for farming.
The model that emerged was an innovative arrangement where the
farmer owns the productive agricultural value of the land while
a nonprofit organization owns all the land's additional speculative
or market value.
<P>
<IMG SRC="woman&child.gif" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=171 ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
<P>

Although not the first open space conservation easement plan,
this new model, based on the concept of shared-equity, was developed
to more fully address agricultural issues in the preservation
of land. In fact, unique to this approach are the legally binding
deed restrictions that ensure the land will be kept in active
farming use; that it will be farmed with either organic or biodynamic
methods; and that the resale value is based solely on the land's
agricultural value.  Steve and Gloria Decater<B> </B>of Live Power
Community Farm and members of their community, notably the Live
Power Community Farm CSA (community supported agriculture project
or subscription farm), worked for four years to turn these concepts
into a reality that would secure the integrity and agricultural
future of their farm. Through donations, $81,000 was raised for
the land trust's equity, while the Decaters purchased the agricultural
value of the land and the building improvements for $69,000. 
The progressive public and private partnership in Live Power Community
Farm became official in the summer of 1995 when the sale was completed.
<P>
SAREP's involvement with the project began in October 1994.  A
$5,000 grant was awarded to the proposal Sharing the Costs of
Land Tenure and Stewardship, which outlined the preparation of
a manual on shared-equity. 
<P>
&quot;It is critical that the process as experienced by the Decaters
be documented in order to establish precedent, enabling other
communities and farmers to pursue similar actions,&quot; says
<B>Jered Lawson</B>, principal investigator of the project.  
<P>
The manual is intended to be a tool of empowerment and introduction
to shared-equity, with particular emphasis on the elements developed
by the people of Live Power Community Farm. Specifics such as
where to find a nonprofit partner, how to go about raising necessary
funds, and drafting the Easement or Option are covered in practical
&quot;how to&quot; instructions. With enough information to allow
the methods to be adapted to individual needs, the manual is a
handbook for farmers, landowners and investors who have at heart
a concern for the future existence of family farms and the promotion
of farming methods that will sustain the integrity and productivity
of the land. 
<P>
A draft of the manual will be available at a workshop on the legal
and financial mechanics of land tenure options for community supported
projects May 3-5 at the Headlands Institute in Sausalito, Calif.

<H1>Agriculture and the Community</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>, SAREP</I>
<P>
One of the most critical issues facing California agriculture
is its interaction with nearby communities and cities. Regions
across the state are being forced to come to terms with how agriculture
can be preserved in the face of increasing market, development
and population pressures.  Realizing that addressing these issues
would need to be a community process, a coalition was formed in
Santa Cruz County in the fall of 1991 with funding from SAREP.
 The goal of the Agriculture and Community Project (Ag Comm) coalition
was to examine &quot;the historical, existing and future status
of agriculture in Santa Cruz County... &quot; and to &quot;collaborate
with the Santa Cruz Community to identify and explore critical
issues to ensure the long-term viability of agriculture.&quot;
<P>
Principal investigators <B>Steve Gliessman </B>of UC Santa Cruz's
Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and <B>Jim</B>
<B>Pepper, </B>Environmental Studies Program at the same campus,
organized and directed the initial nine-member planning committee
representing community interests including agriculture/production,
agriculture/food processing, nutrition/food safety, development,
environment/land use, health/housing, and government.  After meeting
for a year (May 1992-May 1993), the planning committee had defined
topics which provided the foundation for specific areas of research
and became the basis of the agenda for a community wide forum
held November 20, 1993 in Aptos.  At this forum, participants
examined ways in which the entire community is connected to agriculture
and explored strategies to broaden and strengthen this connection.
 Local residents were particularly interested in community education,
encouraging the community to buy locally grown foods and finding
common ground between urban and agricultural interests.
<H3>General Plan Law</H3>

<P>
Concurrently, the planning committee's work led to directed research
by the Ag Comm staff about land use, farmland preservation and
farmworker housing.  Additional information was provided by student
thesis research reviewing farmworker housing and farmland preservation
policies in Santa Cruz County.  Exploration of policy options
included research on agriculture elements that have been drafted
or approved under General Plan law in 11 different counties in
California.  When agriculture is elevated to &quot;element&quot;
status under a county's General Plan, it gains equity with other
recognized elements such as land use, open space, and housing
when planning decisions are made.  As a result of their work on
land preservation, the Agricultural Policy Advisory Commission
to the Board of Supervisors asked the Ag Comm group to advise
them on issues such as agriculture at the urban edge.  Should
the Board of Supervisors and the County Planning Department decide
to pursue an agricultural element, work on General Plan elements
will be compiled along with recommendations for proceeding.
<P>
In the fall of 1994, the continuing interest in land preservation
policies led the Ag Comm group to conduct a &quot;mobile workshop'
or bus tour for local agriculture leaders, planning officials
and policy makers on &quot;Preserving Agricultural Land on the
Edge: Ag Land Preservation Techniques.  &quot; Tour participants
visited selected sites and heard speakers in Marin and Sonoma
counties, both of which have innovative agriculture preservation
policies.  Participants learned about particular tools designed
to preserve ag land and which might be applied in Santa Cruz County.
 A workbook with articles describing the tools and techniques
for preserving ag land produced for this mobile workshop and is
available for purchase from the Ag Comm Project (contact project
assistant <B>Kerstin Ohlander, </B>40,8/459-3524).
<H3>Land Forum</H3>

<P>
A second public forum took place in November 1994, and focused
on land preservation issues in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito
counties.  This forum, &quot;Community and Agriculture: Understanding
the Concerns of a Changing Region, &quot; assessed resource and
land use conflicts at the urban edge.  Keynote speaker was <B>Elizabeth
Scott Graham </B>from American Farmland Trust.  A panel of farmers
discussed their concerns about urban growth and farmland preservation.
 A &quot;tools and techniques&quot; workshop addressed policy,
education and housing issues and their connection with agriculture
at the urban edge.  Finally, participants were able to explore
concerns and potential solutions in county workshops.
<P>
In addition to land use issues, the Ag Comm project also received
a grant from the California Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture
(CASA) to profile Central Coast farmers and understand their contributions
to the local economy and regional food system.  The project's
objective is to understand the similarities among farms involved
in the Lighthouse Farm Campaign, and organic and conventional
growers in terms of their concerns, where they go for assistance
and what their information needs are.  The data gathered from
approximately 60 interviews is being analyzed.  Results will be
available in the spring of 1995.  For more information about this
project, contact <B>Rachel Bornfeld</B> at (408) 459-3524.
<P>
The Ag Comm project is an example of how a small amount of seed
money can initiate a process that continues the discussion, research
and exploration of solutions to the agricultural issues most important
to that community.  According to Kerstin Ohlander, however, this
process takes a lot of time, patience and listening.  This project's
success has been due in part to working with all elements of the
agricultural community and cooperating in areas where there is
common agreement.  Instead of competing for scarce resources,
Ag Comm has focused on ways to form linkages.  Further cooperation
with local agricultural organizations, government agencies, farmers
and citizens will strengthen these links within the county and
provide an opportunity for the community to work together.

More than 125 people, most of them small family farmers, packed
a UC Davis meeting hall in December 1993 ~ for a workshop on community
supported agriculture (CSA) or &quot;subscription&quot; farming.
The conference detailed the CSA concept, in which consumers purchase
subscriptions from nearby farms, allowing farmers to plan ahead
to meet the needs of prepaid customers. Co-sponsored by SAREP,
UC Small Farm Center, Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF),
UC Cooperative Extension and Fiddlers' Green Farm, the one-day
workshop reflected the growing interest of farmers who are seeking
more markets for their produce, and consumers who are pursuing
local fruits and vegetables. <BR>

<P>
<B>Andrew Lorand,</B> a longtime CSA consultant and agriculture
teacher at the Sacramento Waldorf School, began the day's events
with an overview of CSAs in the United States, their history and
some fundamental principles. Subscription farming began in Western
Europe and Japan in the mid-1960s, first appeared in the U.S.
in the mid-1980s, and has recently been gathering momentum in
California. <BR>

<H3>Consumer Contact</H3>

<P>
Lorand said all CSAs have the same fundamental idea Farmers sell
directly to a group of consumers who agree to buy &quot;shares&quot;
in the farmer's harvest in advance. Both farmers and consumers
share in the risk and the bounty of the harvest. Consumers receive
weekly boxes of fresh, seasonal, local produce, often produced
organically. Farmers have a guaranteed market and income for working
capital. According to Lorand, besides the concept of shared risk,
one of the most appealing things about a subscription farm is
that there is direct, personal contact between growers and consumers.
It is a socioeconomic model that can be adapted for any community.
He noted that today, there are more than 400 CSAs around the country
and the number is growing rapidly. <BR>

<P>
The program continued with talks by three CSA farmers including
<B>Sue Temple</B> of Fiddlers' Green Farm, Capay Valley; <B>Judith
Redmond</B> of Full Belly Farm, Capay Valley and CAFF executive
director; and <B>Steve</B> and <B>Gloria Decater</B> of Live Power
Farm in Covelo. They discussed the differences in their CSAs,
their reasons for beginning subscription farming, marketing strategies
for different clientele, farm production organization, the preparation
of produce boxes, educational and communication strategies they
have developed with their shareholders, and the challenges of
CSAs. <BR>

<P>
Each CSA representative described a different method of dealing
with shareholders depending upon the type and number of members,
the percentage contribution the CSA income makes to their entire
farming operation and other factors. Full Belly Farm finds the
presence of an organizer at one of its distribution sites to be
invaluable. Full Belly farmers have developed creative ideas to
determine the right mix of vegetables to plant to fill their 175
weekly boxes; Redmond described the contents of typical boxes
for each season. In addition to a diverse farming operation of
their own, Full Belly farmers sometimes trade vegetables for fruit
or different vegetables from other organic farmers in their neighborhood.
They have also learned how to combine their farmers' market operation
with their CSA business, allowing them to shift items back and
forth as necessary. <BR>

<H3>Farm Diversity Key</H3>

<P>
Redmond noted that not only is diversity important on the farm
and in the CSA boxes, but biological and economic diversity is
a crucial element for the survival of agriculture in California.
<BR>

<P>
She said the concept of community supported agriculture &quot;allows
us to put our vision and hopes for California agriculture into
practice. CSA works against short-term concentration of resources.
It improves California agriculture by  giving consumers a choice
in the future.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&quot;We're creating an economic partnership  between farmers
and consumers by establishing a direct, stable market,&quot; she
said. &quot;This also allows us to exchange ideas with subscribers
about our food system and California agriculture.&quot; <BR>

<P>
The Decaters, who are developing a solar power-based farming system
and plow with draft horses, sell 100 percent of their produce
through the CSA. They have developed a loyal group of shareholders
in San Francisco and are building their rural membership in Covelo
and Willits. Their San Francisco shareholders insisted that they
increase their share price by 45 percent when they had to raise
money to make major farm improvements. They said that at first
they were reluctant to raise prices, but now feel it was the right
decision. The Decaters spend a lot of time marketing their CSA
to potential Customers. They said it is important to explain to
people what they already pay for vegetables at the supermarket
over the course of a year and how par. participating in a CSA
can be better for them. The Decaters emphasized the importance
of freshness, quality, variety, support for the local community
and the connection subscribers will have with the farm. <BR>

<H3>Identify Goals<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Sue Temple discussed the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of starting
and operating a CSA from her perspective at Fiddlers' Green. Before
the Temples started their CSA, they identified the short- and
long-term goals of doing a CSA and thoroughly researched organizational
production and marketing issues. Temple suggested that before
beginning a CSA, it is important to know the individual farm.
Then the farmer can decide if a CSA would complement the existing
operation or how the operation might shift to accommodate a CSA.
Temple noted that it is essential to know the consumer base, including
the family size, ages, buying and eating habits and financial
capabilities. Finally, she suggested that CSA farmers make a commitment
to a relationship with their land <I>and</I> with their consumers.
Temple said that education and communication are essential elements
in building community among shareholders. In addition to communicating
with customers through a newsletter, the Temples make opportunities
available for their members to visit the farm for work days and
potlucks. Members and their families can see the seasonal rhythms
for themselves as they help with planting, harvesting or simply
enjoy the beauty of the farm. The Temples believe in the CSA approach
because it helps people understand where their food comes from,
connects them with the earth and with each other. <BR>

<P>
After a panel discussion and question-and answer period, more
than 50 participants drove to Fiddlers' Green Farm for a farm
tour and more personal discussions with Temple, co-owner<B> Jim</B>
<B>Eldon</B>, and harvest manager <B>Liz Milazzo.</B> <BR>

<P>
Workshop participants' enthusiasm led to a second CSA conference
in March in Escondido in Southern California co-sponsored by UC
Cooperative Extension and the Small Farm center For more information

<H1>BGH, Rotational Grazing &amp; Land Grants<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Recently I participated in The Joint Economic Committee of Congress'
hearing on <I>Agricultural Industrialization and Family Farms:
The Role of Federal Policy.  </I>I was asked to discuss a multidisciplinary
project I have been coordinating that compares bovine growth hormone
(bGH) and rotational grazing, a pasture management technology.
<B> Suzanne Smalley</B> of Michigan State University Extension
was among those panel members who responded to my presentation.
 She noted that in Michigan many farmers have asked the university
for information about how rotational grazing has been used by
other farmers.  Unfortunately, although the scientists at MSU
have information on bGH, they have very little on rotational grazing,
she said.<BR>
<P>
If Land Grant universities' mission is to serve the citizens of
the states, how is it that we have such a dichotomy between information
people apparently want from universities and what many scientists
are prepared to deliver?  This issue may go to the heart of the
questions that are important to Land Grant universities.  Almost
across the board, American universities are suffering severe budget
cuts.  University scientists feel forced to seek industry grants
to continue their research.  This is the case with bGH.  Biotechnology
companies provide research money to help develop this product.
 Taxpayers' money (faculty salaries, laboratories, research farms)
is used for private product development.  That means industry
grants can set the research agenda. Rotational grazing is a management
approach that produces few products that can be sold, and it therefore
does not attract large industrial development grants.<BR>
<P>
I also suspect that most scientists are looked upon more favorably
by their peers if they work on bGH rather than on rotational grazing
because the growth hormone appears to be more &quot;scientific.&quot;
 All of this suggests that for some Land Grant university scientists,
their clients are other scientists rather than the people they
are meant to serve.  It also raises practical and ethical questions
about how research agendas are determined and how the public's
money is spent.<BR>
<P>
Who makes the decisions about where agriculture is headed?  How
can the public interest be safeguarded?  These are very difficult
ethical and pragmatic questions, but support of and good will
toward public Land Grant universities in the 1990s may well depend
upon how well we answer them. Let's use the dairy industry as
a case study, and avoid shaping its future by default: &quot;The
money was there for research and we developed a product&quot;
is not acceptable.  An agricultural research agenda attuned to
the public's needs is developed through an open process involving
the people of the <I>state. -<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, director UC Sustainable

<H1>Organic Growers Must Register<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A new California law that took effect in October 1991 requires
all organic growers to register with their county departments
of agriculture.  Assembly Bill 645<I>, </I>which implements the
California Organic Foods Act of 1990, provides protection for
producers, handlers, processors, retailers, and consumers of organic
foods marketed in California.  Standards for organic food will
be enforced by the California Department of Food and Agriculture
and the county agricultural departments.<BR>

<H1>Lessons from Down Under<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Twenty-five years ago astronauts were able to land on the moon
because the lunar mission had become a national vision.  Society
has not had a vision of a most important human activity-agriculture.
 As a society, we need to consider how we would like agriculture
to be practiced and the rural landscape to look in the future.
<BR>

<P>
On my recent sabbatical leave to Australia , I drove and flew
over the Northern Territory, an area one-sixth of Australia's
land mass, but with only 180,000 people. The Northern Territory
has 26 cattle stations or large cattle ranches. There are about
three or four major towns in total. The rest of the land area
is mostly unpopulated &quot;bush land.&quot;<BR>

<P>
As I looked out at the Northern Territory, I couldn't help noticing
the contrast with much of the farmland in the United States. In
the Midwest, Northeast and many places in California, the landscape
is dotted with rural communities and surrounded by many small
to medium-sized family farms.  I wondered if the industrialization
of agriculture might lead to the demise of this rural landscape.
 Industrialization tends to lead toward fewer and larger farms
and fewer rural communities-a landscape more similar to that of
the Northern Territory.  Is this what we want?<BR>

<P>
Society needs to address the issue of where agriculture is headed,
and how the landscape might look, based on different scenarios.
 During the last century, many new agricultural technologies and
policies led to increased production but also resulted in depleting
the rural landscape and moving people off of farms.  Some think
this should continue in the name of &quot;progress,&quot; and
others think this may not be in our best interest.<BR>

<P>
The future of agriculture and its effect on the rural landscape
is a major question, not just for people in agriculture, but for
society as a whole.  It is also a major question that land grant
universities need to address.  While we have become very adept
at looking at the small pieces, we need to consider the effects
of our research on the larger picture as well.  In this issue
of <I>Sustainable Agriculture, </I>we include several articles
that do look at the big picture.  <B>Monica Moore's</B> article
(see page 4) describes the Pesticide Action Network's study of
pesticide use reduction plans in several European countries and
how they might contribute to the transition to more sustainable
agricultural practices in California.  Input was gathered from
a broad range of people in agriculture to develop a draft pesticide
use reduction program for the state of California.  Further work
is now being done to assess incentives and funding mechanisms
associated with the plan.  The development of a pesticide use
reduction plan as an explicit policy goal is one way of contributing
to a vision of sustainable agriculture in California.<BR>

<P>
<B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A>'s</B> article (see page 12) reviews two recent
government reports that describe the potential picture of California's
future agriculture.  One describes the rapid population growth
and loss of prime farmland expected over the next several decades.
 The other predicts the effects of the resulting urban development
on total water resources and their distribution.  According to
these reports, agriculture, one of California's largest industries,
will likely get smaller share.  In response to these reports,
a vision of a more sustainable, resource-conserving agriculture
that is connected with nearby communities looks promising, as
Campbell points out.<BR>

<P>
We in the land grant universities need to solicit input from a
broad cross-section of society to inform our research and education
priorities.  By doing so, we are articulating a vision of where
we do want to be regarding the future of California agriculture.-Bill
<I>Liebhardt, director, UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program.<BR>

<H1>Ventura Food Safety Group<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>SAREP funded the Ventura County Food
Safety/Agricultural Sustainability Policy Project in February
1990 to continue its networking system of representatives of often
opposed points of view (producers, consumers, retailers, environmentalists).
The project will document the group's work as a model of the integration
of sustainable agriculture with food safety policy. Member </I><B>Larry
Yee</B>, <I>UC Cooperative Extension director, Ventura County,
writes about the Ventura County Food Safety Study Group's purpose.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Food safety is one of the most vexing issues facing agriculture
today. A variety of constituencies and interests are involved,
each with a different viewpoint on the tough questions that have
been raised, and each equally passionate about its position. What's
interesting is that everyone seems to agree on what we want -
good health, safe food, a protected environment, economic viability,
and social justice. But when you start to talk about priorities,
time frames, a definition of &quot;what is safe,&quot; who and
what to protect, &quot;hackles&quot; go up, the positions become
entrenched, and the swords start to rattle and clash. Then the
media jumps in and whips up public hysteria.<BR>
<P>
There's hardly a more exciting public policy arena today. In food
safety and other complex and critical issues, the University can
and should play an important role. In the past, applied research
and extension education have been the primary functions of Cooperative
Extension. Now, the difficult role of facilitation is of equal,
if not more, importance.<BR>
<P>
With a small grant from the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program, the Ventura County Food Safety Study Group
was funded for one year to establish an effective process for
addressing food safety concerns and problem resolution. The assumption
underlying this process is that food safety and sustainable agriculture
are inextricably linked. They should be considered together in
the policy arena. The Ventura County effort to address these issues
is unique in that all of the special interest groups are a part
of the process. Our hope is that this coalition-building will
improve the development of a more sustainable agriculture.<BR>
<P>
Imagine a group meeting in which representatives from production
agriculture, consumer groups, environmental organizations, farm
labor, retail produce and an independent testing lab are all seated
around the same table. Imagine the president of the Farm Bureau
sitting next to the president of Mothers and Others for Safe Food.
Toss in the Green's Party, California Rural Legal
<P>
Assistance, a few others, and you have the Ventura County Food
Safety Study Group - 18 different people trying to find some common
ground.<BR>
<P>
Two months after the use of Alar on apples drew widespread interest,
the Cooperative Extension office in Ventura County decided to
try to become more proactive. With the assistance of UC Berkeley
Agricultural Economist<B> L. Tim Wallace</B>, I concluded that
a new forum was needed in which strategies for improving food
safety could be explored, discussed, and debated in a non-threatening
and constructive way. After some hesitation, people from several
organizations met and the Ventura County Food Safety Study Group
was launched. The goals were to rebuild trust and respect between
the different groups, and to open new lines of communication.
The model used for problem resolution is a process that was developed
by the Extension public policy workgroup.<BR>
<P>
Over the last fourteen months participants have learned a great
deal.  Progress has been slow but steady. Through three-hour meetings
once a month and several field trips, misconceptions and myths
have been dispelled, people are listening to each other and there
is better understanding and communication among the participants.
Discussions have not always been easy, but they've been lively
and generally positive and constructive.<BR>
<P>
A big breakthrough came this summer when the group went on tours
to actually see and experience some of the things we had been
discussing. The group visited various members' production, processing,
and retail food operations.  These visits provided a broader perspective
and understanding of the actual food system at work. In hindsight,
this &quot;reality check&quot; should have been done earlier in
the process. It will be interesting to see how the tours change
the flavor of the discussions and the proposals being discussed.
<BR>
<P>
While no policy recommendations on food safety have been developed,
many alternatives aimed at improving the existing system have
been identified and discussed. Each alternative is reviewed and
evaluated against a list of criteria including environmental costs,
enforceability, and improved credibility. Each is also considered
from the perspective of each member of the food system (i.e.,
the farmer, retailer, processor). One of the more tangible alternatives,
for example, is a special label that would be affixed to produce
grown in Ventura county that meets all the requirements of the
system developed by the study group.<BR>
<P>
Because the process is probably more important than the product,

<H1>Forestry Workshops Succeed With Diverse Players</H1>
<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A>, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
A series of three, SAREP-funded workshops on sustainable forestry
management options for non-industrial landowners has resulted
in proposed regulations now being considered by the California
Board of Forestry.  The new regulations would provide important
incentives to encourage small landowners to manage their forests
in a way that balances economic viability and environmental sustainability.
<BR>
<P>
The workshops, which took place in Briceland, Eureka, and Dunsmuir,
were coordinated by <B>Kim Rodrigues</B>, Cooperative Extension
forest advisor for Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. Rodrigues
brought together small landowners, professional foresters, environmentalists,
and regulators to discuss the implementation of recent legislation
in the California Forest Practices Act.  The legislation allows
non-industrial forest landowners with fewer than 2,500 acres of
timberland to file non-industrial timber management plans (NTMPs)
rather than the traditional timber harvesting plans (THPs).  The
NTMP is a long-term plan providing for sustainable forest growth
and uneven-aged management practices.  (Uneven-aged provides for
at least three distinct age or size classes distributed throughout
the forest.)  The THP has a shorter-term of three to five years
and does not require uneven-aged management.<BR>
<P>
There is widespread agreement in the agroforestry community that
past laws and regulations have often encouraged poor management
decisions, resulting in many forest lands badly in need of restoration,
according to Rodrigues.   Massive erosion problems, poor regeneration
of desired species, and forest conversion from predominantly conifer
to hardwood stands are just some of the problems that threaten
fish and wildlife habitat, soil fertility, tree health, and forest
productivity.<BR>
<P>
But there remain important disputes about how best to achieve
sustainable forestry.  The workshops provided an open forum for
discussion and dialogue, resulting in greater clarity about issues
at dispute, and a slow building of trust among the parties.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Often the biggest obstacles we face are not the limits of
natural resources, but conflict between individuals with economic
and social differences,&quot; Rodrigues said.  &quot;The workshops
succeeded in bringing together a core group that is having a significant
impact in changing the existing regulations.  It's not a long-term
solution, but it is an important step in the right direction.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
Among the changes being sought is a way to help landowners reduce
the high cost of hiring a Registered Professional Forester (RPF)
to complete the NTMP.  The new proposal would decrease these costs
by facilitating a more active role for landowners and the Department
of Forestry in developing the plans, limiting the need for the
relatively costly services of the RPF. Without these and other
proposed incentives, landowners seeking to be good stewards of
their forest would find it economically difficult or impossible
to do so.<BR>
<P>
Each of the workshops included a field day to allow participants
to learn more about specific forest management techniques.<BR>
<P>
&quot;On the ground you get at people's real concerns in a way
you can't in a classroom setting,&quot; said Rodrigues.  &quot;I
think we really began to foster a greater sense of stewardship
among the landowners.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Rodrigues anticipates that forestry regulations and restrictions
will continue to change rapidly, with an increasing emphasis on
long-term sustainability.  She fears that unless those regulations
are accompanied by incentives for small landowners, they will
be asked to shoulder too much of the cost of reversing past abuses.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;It is time we quit imposing further legislative restrictions
and start fostering a sense of stewardship by providing education,
incentives, and benefits to non-industrial timberland owners,&quot;
Rodrigues said. <BR>

<H1>Grasses/Legumes:  Dream Team</H1>
<P>
<I>by Robert L. Bugg, UC SAREP and Rick Miller, UC Davis agronomy
&amp; range science department<BR>
</I>
<P>
What would Gilbert have been without Sullivan?  Laurel without
Hardy?  In the most highly-accomplished and acclaimed duos, it
is difficult to define one collaborator apart from the other.
 Somehow, synergy can make the whole greater than the sum of the
parts.  An outstanding example is the grass-legume collaboration.
 Grasses and legumes have key roles to play in agriculture, and
they often function best in tandem.<BR>
<P>
As vegetarians know, grains derived from grasses (barley, corn,
millet, oats, rice, rye, wheat) and legumes (beans, lentil, peas)
complement one another.   Alone, neither group provides the balance
of amino acids optimal for the human diet;  together, they provide
a high quality source of protein.   It is no coincidence that
for millennia, native peoples of the Americas have grown corn
and beans side by side, as Africans and Asians have grown cowpeas
or hyacinth bean in polycultures with sorghum or millet.  But
there is more basis to such combinations than human dietary needs
alone would indicate.<BR>
<P>
In conjunction with other key collaborators (Rhizobia bacteria
that are housed in root nodules), many types of legumes can convert
atmospheric nitrogen into protein.  Few other plant families fix
significant amounts of nitrogen, so legumes are a key component
in sustainable farming systems.  Leguminous cash crops (beans,
cowpeas, lentils, peanuts, pigeonpeas, garden peas) or forages
(clovers, medics, vetches) require little or nothing in the way
of added nitrogen fertilizer.  Sometimes the residues of these
crops can contribute substantial nitrogen to following crops.
 Leguminous cover crops plowed down as green manures can provide
nitrogen to associated non-leguminous crops.<BR>
<H3>Root Systems</H3>
<P>
Legumes often have relatively simple root systems, dominated by
a central taproot and often heavily nodulated.  Many legumes have
symbiotic relationships with fungi that produce mycorrhizae (literally
&quot;fungus roots&quot;) that ramify through the soil and can
help the plant obtain scarce nutrients (e.g., phosphorus).  Grasses
may have mycorrhizae as well, but typically rely on dense masses
of fibrous roots.  These improve soil structure by exuding polysaccharides
that stimulate soil microorganisms which in turn exude gums that
aggregate soil particles.  The fine roots of grasses also bind
soil crumbs directly.  The formation of waterstable soil aggregates
leads to increased water infiltration and retention, reduced run-off
and erosion, and retention of nutrients.  Grasses can make efficient
use of nitrogen already in the soil, because their roots are adept
at scavenging nitrogen that might otherwise leach from the soil
as nitrate and perhaps contaminate ground or surface waters.<BR>
<H3>Expensive Metabolism  </H3>
<P>
Nitrogen fixation is metabolically expensive; left to their own
devices, legumes assimilate preexisting soil nitrogen before symbiotic
fixation occurs in the nodules.  But because grasses are typically
more efficient at competing for soil nitrogen, legumes grown in
mixtures with grasses are forced to obtain higher proportions
of nitrogen by fixation.  Total  amount of  nitrogen fixed by
legumes may be increased by the inclusion of grasses.  Grasses
can sometimes obtain nitrogen through mycorrhizal links to the
nitrogen-fixing nodules of legume roots.  Grasses contribute carbohydrates
to the mycorrhizal association and in return receive fixed nitrogen,
phosphorus, or other nutrients accumulated by adjacent legumes,
again reducing the need for fertilizers.  Grasses (barley, oats)
are commonly interseeded as &quot;nurse crops&quot; with certain
legumes (alfalfa, sour clover, sweet clovers), because they aid
in weed control.  Oats can even help suppress weeds when seeded
into established alfalfa strands.<BR>
<P>
The use of grass-legume mixtures also enables a cover crop to
respond to spatial variation in soils and perhaps in time to reduce
their heterogeneity.  In nitrogen-poor areas, legumes will tend
to dominate, whereas grasses will do relatively well in areas
rich in nitrogen.  This points up the importance of feedback loops
in sustainable agriculture.  Nitrogen fertilizer is an important
input in the simplified, &quot;leaky&quot; systems that are more
common in conventional agriculture.  Such inputs are much less
important to tighter, more complex agroecosystems.<BR>
<H3>Seasonal Specialties</H3>
<P>
Grasses and legumes may divide a resource temporally as well as
spatially.  In the southern United States, warm-season perennial
forage grasses (Bahia grass, Bermuda grass) can be grown in conjunction
with cool-season annual forage legumes (arrowleaf clover, crimson
clover, subterranean clovers).  The warm-season perennial grasses
make use of the Hatch-Slack process, an alternative photosynthetic
pathway that is advantageous under hot, dry conditions.  No legumes
share this pathway.  By contrast, the legumes mentioned grow well
during cold, cloudy weather.  This permits year-round forage production,
and a reduced need for nitrogen fertilizers. As a counterpart
to the foregoing example, the alfalfa-oats combination mentioned
earlier matches a cool-season annual grass with a warm-season
perennial legume.<BR>
<P>
Above-ground structural differences can also lead to complementarity.
 For example, hairy vetch is often grown in combination with cereal
rye or with oats, because these grasses provide structural support
to the vining vetch.<BR>
<H3>Green Manures</H3>
<P>
When grown as green manures, legumes typically have a lower carbon-to-nitrogen
ratio than do grasses, and grasses often contain higher proportions
of lignin, which is resistant  to  decay.     Moreover, leguminous
residues are often more palatable to earthworms than are those
of grasses.  Together, these factors can lead to quicker disappearance
of leguminous residues, the quick liberation of nutrients, and
their prompt availability to associated cash crops.  By contrast,
the slower breakdown of lignin-rich grass residues may lead to
the formation of humus, which contributes to  improved  cation
 exchange capacity  and  better  long-term nutrient availability.
<BR>
<P>
There is much interest among California growers in using cover
crops to provide habitat for beneficial arthropods.  Grasses are
typically wind pollinated, and produce large amounts of windblown
pollen, mainly   during   the   spring.  Windblown pollen can
be an early-season food source to predatory mites (e.g., <I>Euseius
</I>spp.) that are important in the control of citrus and avocado
pests, and it is also used by certain parasitic wasps.  By contrast,
legumes are often insect pollinated, and can provide pollen and
nectar to flower-visiting insects (bees, wasps, and flies).  Several
legumes (clovers, sweetclovers) are important honey plants, and
some (bell  bean,   common  vetch, sweetclovers) provide nectar
to predatory and parasitic insects important in biological control
of pests.<BR>
<P>
Studies in southern Georgia indicate that during late winter and
early spring, cereal rye hosts bird-cherry oat aphid, whereas
hairy vetch later harbors abundant pea aphid.  Populations of
lady beetles were observed to build up early on the cereal rye,
and later move to the hairy vetch.<BR>
<H3>Not All Compatible</H3>
<P>
Based on this glittering panegyric to grass-legume mutualism,
one might be tempted to infer that all grasses are eminently compatible
with all legumes.  Such is not the case:  In interactions  between
 groups  as diverse as the grasses (Poaceae: 8,000  species  worldwide)
 and legumes (Fabaceae: 18,000 species), many combinations are
simply non-starters.  This is not surprising in light of the wide
range of environmental optima and tolerances within each family.
 Sometimes the associations require fine tuning through management.
 Varieties that harmonize best with one another should be selected
to maximize the value  of microbial  and  plant coevolution, with
application to sustainable farming systems.<BR>

<H1>Atmospheric emissions from agricultural burning in California:
Determination of burn fractions, distribution factors, and crop-specific
contributions.</H1>
<P>
<I>Jenkins, B.M., S.Q. Turn and R.B. Williams</I>
<P>
Agric. Ecosystems Environ. 38:313-330. 1992<BR>
<P>
State legislation enacted in 1983 stipulates that new energy producing
facilities that rely on biomass fuels should not result in an
increase in the total pollutant emissions for the district in
which the facility is constructed.  The legislation requires that
new facilities reduce or offset pollution levels elsewhere in
the region.  Since the burning of agricultural wastes in power
plants reduces certain types of air pollutants compared to field
burning, crop residues could be considered offset fuels.  This
allowance establishes an economic incentive for using agricultural
wastes as fuels.<BR>
<P>
In 1984, the California Air Resources Board, which has primary
responsibility for regulating atmospheric emissions, developed
a procedure to determine the magnitude of the offset credits,
that is, the incremental emissions permitted in a given period
of time because facilities use offset fuels.  The offset credit
for a particular pollutant (in kg per day) takes into account:
1) the quantity of biomass used by the facility, 2) the mass of
pollutant emitted per mass of biomass burned, and 3) the fraction
of the total crop residue that is burned in the field during a
specified period (winter, spring, summer, fall).<BR>
<P>
The purpose of this study was to determine with greater accuracy
the third factor listed, i.e., the proportion of the crop residue
burned in a given season of the year.  This information would
be used to refine the procedure for calculating allowable atmospheric
emissions from power-generating facilities using fuel that would
otherwise be burned in the field.
<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
The authors attempted to use two sources for their study: 1) a
compilation of agricultural burn reports, and 2) direct survey
(interviews) of growers.   Because the burn reports were shown
to be highly inaccurate, only the interview method was used. 
Interviews were conducted with 609 growers in Fresno, Kern, Merced,
and Stanislaus Counties.  Sixteen crops were represented, including
6 field crops and 10 orchard and vine crops.  In addition to the
survey results, existing information on emission factors and crop
residue yields statewide were used.
<H3>Results</H3>
<P>
The proportion of crop residue burned in the San Joaquin Valley
was high for almonds, apricots, cherries, walnuts, and rice (table
1).<BR>

The total emissions from agricultural burning were highest for
almonds, walnuts, rice, and wheat. Statewide, orchard and vine
crops account for 27 percent of the agricultural biomass that
is burned; for the San Joaquin Valley alone, this figure increases
to 75 percent of the total biomass burned.  The difference between
the statewide percentage and that for the San Joaquin Valley alone
is due primarily to rice straw burning in the Sacramento Valley.
 Statewide, rice and almonds together make up 82 percent of the
agricultural biomass that is burned (table 2).<BR>
<P>
Emissions of particulate matter into the atmosphere from agricultural
burning are over 3.5 million tons annually in California. This
figure, however, represents less than 1 percent of the total particulate
matter emissions from various sources.  The contribution of<I>
</I>agricultural burning to emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,
oxides of nitrogen, and sulfur is also quite low, both statewide
and in the San Joaquin Valley.<BR>
<P>
While the authors found some inconsistencies in the quarterly
distribution of emissions, the very high value obtained by the
survey for the fall season was consistent with rice straw burning
in the Sacramento Valley.  On an annual basis, power plants would
have full emission offsets available. On a quarterly basis, however,
they are likely to lose offsets in the spring and summer when
power plant emissions exceed field burning emissions.  To protect
ambient air quality, therefore, the facilities will be required
to: 1) install additional pollution control equipment, 2) reduce
non-agricultural source emissions to obtain sufficient offset
credits, or 3) defer the burning of some fuel sources to different
seasons than would have been the case if field burned.<BR>

<H1>Farmers Reveal Transition Motivations</H1>
<P>
<I>by Ann Drescher Mayse, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B>  <I>The following article is from a SAREP
publication on making the transition to more sustainable farming
practices, scheduled for release in 1991.<BR>
</I>
<P>
According to interviews with 12 California growers from February
through May 1990, growers have many motivations for changing their
production systems.  The motivations can be organized into the
broad categories of  <B>economics, solutions to farming problems,
public policy</B>, and <B>grower attitudes</B>.
<H3>Economics</H3>
<P>
<I>Lowering Inputs<BR>
</I>The changing economics of production were often cited by growers
as an important motivation.  The benefits of high input/high yield
agriculture have been enjoyed for more than 40 years.  During
the last ten years the cost of fuel, fertilizers, and pesticides
has risen dramatically in relation to prices received for products.
 As one grower summarized, &quot;There appears to be less room
for error in farming today, with financing harder, more regulation,
and profit margin lower because expenses are higher and the price
received for products hasn't increased with the cost of production.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
One effective strategy for reducing production costs is through
careful monitoring and reduction of inputs.  The exact strategy
differs among farms and communities, but monitoring and input
reduction have been successful in cases ranging from reduced tillage
for fuel conservation, to incorporation of green manures and crop
rotation for fertility, to the use of integrated pest management
techniques.  Economic trade-offs are clearly involved, and most
growers said they tend to use more intense and creative management.
<H3>Solutions to Current Farming Problems</H3>
<P>
Many growers are making changes because of their concerns about
important production problems including pest resistance, dependence
upon non-renewable energy, and adverse environmental impacts of
their farming systems.<BR>
<P>
<I>Biological Factors<BR>
</I>A tree fruit grower noted that if two or three major pests
in each of his crops could be controlled through non-disruptive
methods, he would not use pesticides, which cause secondary pest
outbreaks and other problems.  The same grower is also exploring
ways to reduce cultivation to preserve a surface mulch and active
biological layer.<BR>
<P>
A rice and row crop grower developed a different strategy.  He
reported finding rotations and cultural practices that actually
use some weeds to an advantage to provide biomass and organic
matter.  His techniques came after several years of experimentation
with crops and rotations, and involved a desire to modify his
farming practices.<BR>
<P>
<I>Environmental Degradation<BR>
</I>Agriculture's impact on the surrounding environment also affects
farmers, their families, and their land.  The need to address
problems of soil erosion, ground and surface water pollution,
and air quality are clearly important for the  well-being of the
agricultural community.<BR>
<P>
A coastal grape grower reported that her objective was to reduce
both soil erosion and dust.  She planted a fescue cover, converted
to drip irrigation, and didn't &quot;try to have the most beautiful,
weed-free vineyard&quot; anymore.  She said she has reduced erosion,
saved water, and reduced electrical energy use while preserving
yield and quality.<BR>
<P>
Although soil quality was seldom cited during interviews as a
primary motivation for changing production systems, it was a common
secondary benefit that later became extremely important.  A highly
successful Central Valley grape producer switched from commercial
fertilizer to legumes, compost, and other mineral soil amendments.
 He made these changes to increase vine health through what he
described as the proper balance of nutrients in the soil, including
trace elements.
<H3>Public Policy</H3>
<P>
While many farmers are reluctant to make changes because of real
and perceived risks, virtually all California farmers are feeling
pressures.  Many of the pressures come from outside the farm.
 Several interviewed growers felt they were actually reducing
economic risk by making limited changes in production practices
in order to gain experience.<BR>
<P>
<I>Increased Regulation<BR>
</I>Concerns about environmental quality continue to influence
agriculture.  Several growers said that regulations would soon
force them to find alternatives, and they would prefer to make
some changes now.  A rancher explained that making a transition
strictly motivated by compliance with regulations is very stressful.
<BR>
<P>
A Merced County grower saw the trend coming six years ago and
decided to experiment.  First attracted by the organic food premium,
his interest in new production systems was further fueled by restrictions
on pesticides.  He said if materials now under scrutiny are further
restricted, he believes his several years of experimentation have
given him the knowledge to succeed without these materials.  A
Glenn County rice grower has similar motivations as he experiments
with alternatives to rice burning.<BR>
<P>
<I>Consumer Pressure<BR>
</I>Although advances in food technology have provided high quality,
readily available and affordable food, many consumers are concerned
about the potential residues of fertilizers, pesticides, hormones,
antibiotics, and heavy metals.  Markets are often consumer-driven,
and while it is important to avoid passing fads, farmers may find
it profitable to use consumer preferences to their advantage.
<H3>Attitude Changes</H3>
<P>
Growers interested in modifying their farming practices often
start by reading scientific, technical and anecdotal information,
talking with other farmers, and attending meetings.  An agricultural
consultant said, &quot;Changing farming practices is by no means
a snap.  Sometimes it is difficult to figure out solutions, or
there may not be direct solutions.  But we know benign neglect
[is not a solution].&quot;<BR>
<P>
Observation reveals that fertility, diversity, and pest/predator
balances are all common to naturally occurring systems.  As suggested
by a couple who farm in the San Joaquin Valley, it is not the
farm that first changes, but rather the farmer who begins to see
fields differently.  Another grower pointed out that &quot;the
farm does not work like a factory, but instead as a living, breathing
and reproducing entity.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<I>Conclusions<BR>
</I>This brief summary of motivating influences in California
agriculture includes some situations that may be familiar, and
others that may simply raise interesting questions.  Factors that
stimulate change, like solutions to agricultural problems, vary
among individual growers.  While innovation is a time-honored
tradition in agriculture, a rapidly changing and complex set of
motivational factors are affecting California farming today.<BR>

<H1>Farming Systems Comparison Field Day<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Conventional, low-input or organic? Which farming system is most
appropriate? Which makes the most efficient use of resources?
What are the environmental effects of different production practices?
These are some of the questions addressed by a farming systems
comparison project at UC Davis. An August 29 field day at the
UCD agronomy farm offered the public a hands-on view of the project,
<I>Evaluating the Transition from Conventional to Low-Input and
Organic Farming Systems in the Sacramento Valley.  </I>The study
is funded by the UC SAREP, the USDA  Low-Input  Sustainable Agriculture
(LISA) program, the H.J. Heinz Foundation and the UC Davis College
of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.<BR>
<P>
Still in its first year, the project has not yet generated substantive
information for growers. Baseline data and yield data from the
first harvests are being collected. Over the next several years,
however, the 11-member interdisciplinary research team will identity
alternative farming practices that will help growers make the
transition from conventional to low-input and organic farming
systems while maintaining the long-term viability of their farm
businesses. Other research objectives are to conduct interdisciplinary
analyses of the processes that drive various crop rotation systems,
and to test existing and novel farming practices.
<H3>Four Farming Systems</H3>
<P>
To accomplish these objectives, four farming systems that differ
in their reliance on off-farm purchased resources are being compared.
These systems are: 1) a two year rotation of processing tomatoes
and wheat; 2) a four year rotation of processing tomatoes, field
corn, safflower and wheat-dry beans or lupines under conventional
production methods; 3) the same four-year rotation using low-input
practices; and 4) the same four-year rotation using organic production
methods. The low-input and organic rotations will attempt to reduce
the need for off-farm purchased inputs by using alternative practices
including cover crops, manures, biological control and reduced
tillage. Insecticides and other materials not used in organic
production may be used very selectively in the low-input plots.
<H3>Like a Farmer</H3>
<P>
The project is being conducted on 28 acres of UC Davis land with
researchers  having expertise in agronomy, entomology, soil science,
irrigation,  nematology,  weed science, agricultural economics,
environmental toxicology and plant pathology. UC farm advisors
and conventional and organic farmers are providing guidance and
suggestions for management. One of the most important priorities
of this project is to manage it as farmer would, according to
Mike Hoffman, a project entomologist. Because of this goal, management
of the different production systems will be evolving as the experiment
progresses, he said.<BR>

<BR>
</I>
<P>
Seasonal employment is considered a fact of life for California's
farmworkers, but a SAREP-sponsored project concludes that extended
and year-round employment for farmworkers can be both feasible
and profitable. The two-year study, headed by research agricultural
economist <B>Suzanne Vaupel</B> and San Joaquin County Cooperative
Extension director <B>Gary Johnston</B>, examines the benefits
and challenges for farmers who keep workers employed &quot;year-round&quot;
by leveling out the peaks and valleys of seasonal employment.
The results are available in a workbook, <I>Year-Round and Extended
Employment for Agricultural Workers: Why any How?</I> (available
for $8 from UC SAREP, 916/752-7556). <BR>

<P>
&quot;It turns out that strategies such as crop diversity, which
are introduced for agronomic reasons, can also improve labor conditions
for both farmers and farmworkers,&quot; says Vaupel. &quot;With
some imagination and planning, farmers can find diverse crops
and other strategies which spread out the work and avoid the problems
of layoffs and rehires, while workers can find stable employment
in a single location.&quot; <BR>

<P>
The researchers gathered their information from a variety of sources.
With the help of <B>Franz</B> <B>Kegel</B>, San Joaquin County
emeritus farm advisor, they interviewed 32 San Joaquin County
fruit, nut, field crop and vegetable farmers. They also conducted
in-depth case studies of three innovative growers, one each in
Riverside, Yolo, and Mendocino counties. Results from this work
were then presented to focus groups of farmers in the Fresno and
Stockton areas and at major farm conferences for comment and feedback.
<BR>

<P>
According to the study, the path to year-round worker employment
is different for each farmer. One began year-round employment
because he wanted to stay in the market with a constant supply
of fresh produce. Another started extending his farming/employment
sea son by growing winter crops because he had limited water to
irrigate summer crops. Still another saw profitable opportunities
for diversifying into alternative crops and practices. <BR>

<P>
Most of the strategies used to extend the season and employ workers
year-round fall into the following categories: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>Diversifying crops and crop varieties, as well as farm enterprises;

</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Pacing the work by staggering planting, spreading tasks over
a longer period of time, and saving work for the off-season; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Selective mechanization to avoid labor-saving technologies
that do not help to stabilize employment of workers or to avoid
labor peaks; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Use of new technologies such as plastic tunnels, hot caps,
and greenhouse starts to extend the Season
</UL>

<P>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Use of break-even or marginal return crops for both agronomic
reasons (crop rotation) and to fill in employment gaps; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Connecting with other farmers and local industries that offer
off-season employment.
</UL>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Farmers using these strategies experience immediate and tangible
benefits, including lower training costs, availability of workers
when they are needed, increased productivity and dependability,
lower unemployment and workers' compensation insurance rates,
less damage to equipment, and a year-round cash flow. These same
farmers report feelings of personal satisfaction from a closer
and more supportive relationship with their workers <BR>

<P>
&quot;One farmer went so far as to offer interest free new auto
loans to his workers because he was sick of seeing them pay 25
percent interest,&quot; says Johnston. <BR>

<P>
More than 90 percent of the farmers interviewed for the study
regularly provide interest-free short-term loans and advances
to their regular workers. <BR>

<P>
The workbook also notes the challenges for farmers who would like
to move toward year-round employment. While climate and soils
provide some limitations, the biggest challenges are human. One
farmer noted that some workers wanted the freedom to travel to
Mexico to visit family during peak season, and had to be told
they could not if they wanted the job. Another noted that a closer
relationship with workers meant a greater sense of responsibility
toward their problems, including the difficulties of finding housing
and negotiating bank loans.<BR>

<P>
Although farmers with year-round employees pay somewhat higher
wages and benefits than if they were using seasonal workers hired
through a farm labor contractor, they believe that their bottom-line
is higher. &quot;Profitability is the main answer farmers give
to why they hire workers for extended and year-round employment,&quot;
says Vaupel. Indeed, the creative strategies described in this
workbook are an excellent example of how an integrated approach
to farming operations can be, simultaneously, economically viable,
environmentally sound, and socially responsible. <BR>

<H1>Citrus Herbicides &amp; Groundwater Quality</H1>
<P>
<I>By Chuck Ingles, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>(Editor's Note: This is the second part of a two-part series
on citrus production and groundwater contamination. Part 1 appeared
in Sustainable Agriculture News, Vol.4, No.2, Winter 1992. Information
from this series will be included in a SAREP citrus publication
due out at the end of 1992.)<BR>
</I>
<P>
For citrus growers, prevention of nitrate leaching can be a far
more difficult task than that of herbicide leaching: farmers cannot
simply stop applying nitrogen (N).  The problem is a concern to
both conventional and organic growers, since nitrate can leach
below the root zone from organic and synthetic fertilizers.  Several
management practices exist to reduce the potential for nitrate
leaching.<BR>
<P>
<B>Determine N supply and demand. </B>Citrus trees typically require
about 100 to 150<I> </I>pounds of N/acre/year, however lemons
can require up to double this amount.  Annual leaf analyses can
indicate the need for less N; fertilizing on the basis of leaf
analysis can result in less nitrate leaching while maintaining
fruit quality and yield.  Equally important, and often overlooked,
is the need to sample irrigation water to determine nitrate content,
and to reduce N fertilizer use accordingly.<BR>
<P>
<B>Time of application. </B>The time of maximum N uptake is during
the summer.  Because flowering and fruit set require high levels
of N in the tree, however, N must be made available to the trees
shortly before flowering.  Fertilizer is usually applied in late
winter and early spring, with split soil applications frequently
made in February, March, and April.  Some growers, however, apply
N fertilizer in the fall.  This practice stems from the tradition
of applying raw manure in the fall so that winter rains can move
nitrate into the root zone.  A substantial portion of fall-applied
N will leach beyond the root zone as a result of winter rainfall,
water applied during frosts to warm the orchard, and reduced root
N uptake during the winter.<BR>
<P>
<B>Choice of materials. </B>The choice of N fertilizer can affect
the accumulation and<B> </B>leaching of nitrate.  Synthetic nitrogen
fertilizers supply N in the form of<B> </B>nitrate, ammonium,
and/or urea (which is rapidly converted to ammonium in the soil).
 Some ammonium is taken up by the plants directly and some is
adsorbed onto soil particles, thus delaying N loss through leaching.
However, most of the ammonium is converted to nitrate within a
relatively short period of time. How much nitrate leaches below
the root zone depends on the rate and frequency of application
as well as the depth to which irrigation water percolates.<BR>
<P>
Bulky organic materials such as manure and compost release N more
slowly as the organic matter decomposes.  However, excessive applications
of manure can also result in leaching losses.  Finished compost
supplies a more stable and slow-release form of N than conventional
fertilizers or manure.  Compost applications can therefore be
made at any time of the year without significant loss to leaching.
 Compost also provides the soil with humus, a stable form of organic
matter, which is invaluable in nutrient cycling.  Because of low
N content and expense, most growers who use compost also use supplements
of chemical fertilizers and/or cover crops. Slow-release synthetic
fertilizers are also available; these can reduce the nitrate pollution
potential.  A significant problem with slow-release fertilizers,
including organic materials, is that a continuous N supply can
cause fruit quality problems such as regreening.  A moderate application
of compost, together with spring applications of soluble materials,
may strike a balance between maintaining fruit quality and yields,
reducing nitrate leaching, and improving soil quality.<BR>
<P>
Cover crops can be useful in converting mobile soil nitrate into
immobile plant organic N. Winter annual cover crops can utilize
rainfall for growth and remove excess soil nitrate during winter,
when nitrate leaching potential is the greatest.  (For more information
on cover cropping in citrus, see UC SAREP's <I>Components, Vol.2,
No.3, Summer 199].)<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Foliar applications of urea </B>result in vastly reduced nitrate
pollution potential compared to soil-applied N, and yield and
fruit quality can be maintained or enhanced.  A practical fertilization
strategy might be to supply half the N to the foliage (two to
four sprays) and half through soil applications.  Foliar sprays
may be applied in the winter and early spring, but researchers
at UC Riverside have recently shown that January and February
applications may lead to the highest yields.  Organic materials
such as fish emulsion may be useful as foliar sprays, although
they contain less N and are far more expensive than urea.  The
practice of applying N to the foliage is not universally accepted.
 Some growers believe that the nutrient pathway is and should
be through the roots<B><FONT FACE="Arial">.<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>&quot;Fertigation.&quot; </B>The application of water-soluble
fertilizers through the irrigation system is called &quot;fertigation.&quot;
 If the depth of wetting can be limited as well, fertigation can
provide a &quot;steady state&quot; of N availability only when
N is needed by the tree, with greatly reduced potential for nitrate
leaching.  Fertigation can be used in small amounts up to 15 times
through the spring. (Often only three to five applications are
made.)<BR>
<P>
Growers of all crops are being challenged to produce safe, inexpensive
food without damaging the soil, the air, or the water.  They must
also maintain their economic stability.  In the long term, however,
economic stability is dependent on environmental and social well-being.
 Citrus growers are confronted with numerous obstacles to sustainability.
 Yet many practices have been developed to reduce the environmental
impacts.  Should we wait until regulations force us to be nonpolluting?

<H1>UC Research on Cover Cropping- Reports Available</H1>

<P>A report that includes more than 40 summaries of research projects relating
to cover cropping is now available in print and through SAREP's Cover Crop
Resource Page on the World Wide Web (<A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu</A>).
The summaries were compiled by former SAREP perennial cropping systems
analyst Chuck Ingels, chair of the UC Cover Crops Workgroup. The workgroup,
which includes 80 University of California personnel and several individuals
from outside the university, was formed in 1994. Its purpose is to bring
together UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors and specialists, DANR faculty
and others to share information on cover cropping, determine the highest
priority research and extension needs, and coordinate activities to fulfill
these needs. The third annual workgroup meeting took place at UC Davis
on March 21-22, 1996 in conjunction with the Sustainable Agriculture Farming
Systems project's spring meeting. The purpose of the workgroup meeting
was to train statewide UC and Natural Resources Conservation Service personnel.
</P>

<P>The report contains summaries compiled for the last three workgroup
meetings. (Summaries will be compiled every three years from now on.) Summaries
are organized into &quot;Annual Cropping Systems,&quot; &quot;Tree &amp;
Vine Cropping Systems,&quot; and &quot;Other Categories,&quot; which includes
education summaries and a review of cover crop biology. One of the summaries
is presented in the Technical Reviews section of this issue (see page 12).

<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>When used as a green manure, buckwheat is typically ploughed down after 7 to ten days of flowering (Bugg and Ellis, 1990), or before seed is set (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983.).  Residue breaks down rapidly after incorporation (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Buckwheat sown on May 7 entered flower on June 13 and was in full flower by June 20.  The second crop of buckwheat was sown July 7, began flowering by July 29, and attained full flower during the first week of August.  The third crop was sown August 5 and attained full flower during the last week of August (coastal Massachusetts) (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).  In southern Georgia, buckwheat sown on July 3 and 4 had begun flowering by August 1, was in full flower by August 10, and continued flowering until at least September 29 (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is fast growing (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is very frost sensitive (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983; Pears et al., 1989; Gubbels et al., 1990), so sowing is governed by frosts (Pears et al., 1989).  Seeding in Manitoba is delayed until early June (Gubbels et al., 1990).<P> <P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is a fast-growing, frost-sensitive dicotyledonous (broad-leafed) plant used as a summer green manure, and it is sometimes grown immediately after an area is cleared for agriculture (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983.). Fast-growing annuals such as buckwheat or oat may be used during the growing season to prepare for transplants or to protect soil during short periods when it would otherwise be bare (Gershuny and Smillie, 1986).<P> According to Shonbeck (1988), in the Northeast, buckwheat is commonly used for summer cover and weed control; buckwheat was used for weed control by 16 of 51 farms using cover crops in the Northeast.  Buckwheat can also be used to make P and other nutrients more available and to improve soil structure. Buckwheat crops or residues can inhibit weed germination, and several growers and researchers suspect that allelopathy may be involved. Decomposing buckwheat roots can inhibit weed germination, and a buckwheat intercrop can save weeding in squash.  Some growers have reported inadequate control of quackgrass and other stubborn weeds by buckwheat.  Buckwheat produces much less biomass than do other summer cover crops, such as sudangrass (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rate is 60 lb/acre (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983), presumably for the older varieties.  Gubbels and Campbell (1986) reported that seeding rates of 30-45 kg/ha for the new large-seeded varieties 'Mancan' and 'Manor' and semi-dwarf types of buckwheat led to near-maximum yields of seed.  This finding is discrepant with the usually-recommended seeding rate of 40-55 kg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>There is some evidence that buckwheat concentrates calcium and makes it more available to succeeding crops (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seed should be sown at a depth of about 0.5 inches (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Broadcast seed and incorporate with light disking, or use a grain drill. Seed should be sown at a depth of 0.5 inches (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Two crops of buckwheat can be grown successively, the second sown immediately after tilling in the first (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Buckwheat harbored particularly high densities of root lesion nematode (<I>Pratylynchus penetrans</I></B>) (Marks and Townsend, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Fagopyrum esculentum</I></B> Moench (Marks and Townsend, 1973) or also <I>Fagopyrum sagittatum</I></B> Gilib (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>This species will tolerate poor soils (Pears et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is termed a deep rooter by Pears et al.  (1989), but this is apparently an error (Bugg, pers. obs.).  Rooting system is superficial but does show a high root volume in the upper soil stratum (0.0-0.25 m in depth) (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> The ability of buckwheat to acquire phosphorus was characterized by investigating P uptake, morphological features, and chemical changes in the rhizosphere.  Root weight and length, and frequency of root hairs were higher when plants were grown under P-deficiency.  P uptake rates were only moderate, concentrations of P in the shoot were high (1.8% of dry weight). Release of Mn from MnO2- and P from FePO4- and glucose-6-phosphate was not due to a buildup of organic acids in the rhizosphere, but P release was due to high activities of acid phosphatase for plants grown with low P. The following parameters in which buckwheat is outstanding were regarded as important for its P efficiency: (1) a finely divided root system of considerable length with a high ratio of root surface to root or shoot length; (2) a high storage capacity for inorganic P; (3) an increased release of protons and FePO4- or MnO2- solubilizing substances by P-deficient plants; (4) a favorable ratio of P uptake to root mass increase, especially at low P supply; and (5) a high acitivity of acid phosphatase in the rhizosphere and the capability to use P from organic sources. (Annan and Amberger, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Flowers are attractive to hoverflies (Syrphidae) (Pears et al., 1989): in southern Georgia, Bugg and Dutcher (1989) found adults of the following hoverfly (Syrphidae) species visiting buckwheat flowers: <I>Allograpta obliqua</I></B> (Say), <I>Pseudodoros clavatus</I></B> (Fabricius), <I>Ocyptamus fuscipennis</I></B> (Say), <I>Ocyptamus costatus</I></B> (Say), <I>Toxomerus boscii</I></B> Macquart, and </I></B>Toxomerus marginatus</I></B> (Say); these are aphid predators as larvae.  The following predatory wasps were also observed feeding at the flowers, family and genus or species are given, with known prey items in parentheses: Sphecidae: <I>Ammophila</I></B> sp. (Lepidopterous larvae), <I>Bicyrtes quadrifasciatus</I></B> (Say) (Hemiptera), <I>Cerceris</I></B> sp. (Coleoptera), <I>Isodontia apicalis</I></B> (Smith) (Orthoptera: mainly Gryllidae and Tettigoniidae), <I>Philanthus  gibbosus</I></B> (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Mainly Apoidea), <I>Prionyx parkeri</I></B> Bohart and Menke (Orthoptera: Acrididae, <I>Pseudoplisus phaleratus</I></B> (Say) (Homoptera?), <I>Synnevrus plagiatus</I></B> (Cresson) (Unknown), <I>Tachytes guatemalensis</I></B> Cameron (Orthoptera: Acrididae); Eumenidae: <I>Zethus spinipes variegatus</I></B> Saussure, <I>Rhyacionia frustrana</I></B> (Comstock), Nantucket pine tip moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), <I>Stenodynerus</I></B> sp.  (lepidopterous or coleopterous larvae), Vespidae: <I>Polistes exclamans</I></B> Vier. (Mainly lepidopterous larvae).  Also observed were two species of Scoliidae, parasites of Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera), were also observed: <I>Scolia dubia dubia</I></B> Say and <I>Scolia (Scolia) nobilitata nobilitata</I></B> Fab.<P> In Massachusetts, Bugg and Ellis (1990) assessed insects associated with buckwheat and four other cover crops: (1) hairy vetch/cereal rye, (2) sorghum, (3) annual white sweetclover, and (4) bell bean.  Those workers observed 2 types of Tachinidae at the flowers: <I>Trichopoda pennipes</I></B> (F.) (a parasite of true bugs) and an unidentified species near <I>Archytas</I></B> (a parasite of caterpillars).  Adults of the following aphidophagous syrphids were also seen: <I>Allograpta obliqua</I></B> (Say), <I>Sphaerophoria</I></B> spp., <I>Syrphus</I></B> spp., <I>Toxomerus</I></B> spp.; and the following non-aphidophagous syrphids <I>Eristalis tenax</I></B> (L.) and <I>Eristalis</I></B> spp.).  The following species of predatory wasps also fed at the flowers (family and genus or species are given, with known prey items in parentheses): Sphecidae: <I>Sphex ichneumoneus</I></B> (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae; Gryllacrididae; Tettigoniidae), <I>Cerceris fumipennis</I></B> Say (Coleoptera), <I>Cerceris</I></B> sp.  (Coleoptera), <I>Eremnophila aureonotata</I></B> (Cameron)  (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae), <I>Isodontia harrisi</I></B> (Fernald) (Orthoptera), <I>Tachytes pennsylvanicus</I></B> Banks (Orthoptera), <I>Philanthus gibbosus</I></B> (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Mainly Apoidea), <I>Philanthus lepidus</I></B> Cresson (Hymenoptera: Mainly Apoidea), <I>Ectemnius lapidarius</I></B> (Panzer) (Adult Diptera), <I>Oxybelus uniglumis</I></B> (L.) (Adult Diptera), <I>Bicyrtes quadrifasciata</I></B> (Say) (Nymphal Hemiptera: mainly Pentatomidae and Coreidae); Eumenidae: <I>Eumenes fraternus</I></B> Say (lepidopteran larvae), <I>Monobia quadridens</I></B> (L.) (lepidopteran larvae), <I>Ancistrocerus antilope</I></B> (Panzer) (lepidopteran larvae); Vespidae: <I>Polistes fuscatus pallipes</I></B> Lepeletier (mainly lepidopteran larvae), <I>Vespula maculata</I></B> (L.); Pompilidae: 2 unidentified spp. (Araneae).  No Ichneumonoidea were observed imbibing at the flowers of white sweetclover, and few were observed at blooms of buckwheat.  This is consistent with observations by Ozols (1964). Insidious flower bug (<I>Orius insidiosus</I></B>), a beneficial predator, and tarnished plant bug (<I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B>), a pest, were relatively abundant on buckwheat on several sampling dates.  Also abundant were adult aphidophagous Syrphidae and pooled adult Sphecidae (predatory wasps).<P> Bugg and Ellis (1990) noted that insect visitation to buckwheat was low during afternoons, whereas insects continued to visit white sweetclover.  This is consistent with Pellett's (1976) statement that buckwheat often stops producing nectar during the afternoon.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is a fast-growing, frost-sensitive dicotyledonous (broad-leafed) plant used as a summer green manure (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is grown for weed suppression (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P> As reported by Schonbeck (1988), in the Northeast, buckwheat is commonly used for summer cover and weed control; some growers use sudangrass or millet. Buckwheat was used for weed weed control by 16 of 51 farms using cover crops in the Northeast.  This crops or its residues can inhibit weed germination, and several growers and researchers suspect that allelopathy may be involved. Decomposing buckwheat roots can inhibit weed germination, and a buckwheat intercrop can save weeding in squash.  Some growers have reported inadequate control of quackgrass and other stubborn weeds by buckwheat.<P> Of 8 warm-season cover crops assessed in a pecan orchard in southern Georgia, cowpea, alyceclover, and a sorghum-sudangrass hybrid reduced weed vegetational cover better than did buckwheat (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Buckwheat can be used to make P and other nutrients more available (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> The ability of buckwheat to acquire phosphorus was characterized by investigating P uptake, morphological features, and chemical changes in the rhizosphere.  Root weight and length, and frequency of root hairs were higher when plants were grown under P-deficiency.  P uptake rates were only moderate and concentrations of P in the shoot were high (1.8% of dry weight). Release of Mn from MnO2- and P from FePO4- and glucose-6-phosphate were not due to a buildup of organic acids in the rhizosphere, but P release was due to high activities of acid phosphatase for plants grown with low P.  The following parameters in which buckwheat is outstanding were regarded as important for its P efficiency: (1) a finely divided root system of considerable length, with a high ratio of root surface to root or shoot length; (2) a high storage capacity for inorganic P; (3) an increased release of protons and FePO4- or MnO2- solubilizing substances by P-deficient plants; (4) a favorable ratio of P uptake to root mass increase, especially at low P supply; and (5) a high acitivity of acid phosphatase in the rhizosphere and the capability to use P from organic sources (Annan and Amberger, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Buckwheat can be used to improve soil structure (Schonbeck, 1988) and to enhance soil life (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Buckwheat produces much less biomass than do other summer cover crops such as sudangrass (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Old cultivars of buckwheat are 'Tempest' and 'Tokyo,' which are small seeded and mature during midseason.  The large-seeded varieties 'Mancan' and 'Manor' are now prevalent, and mature similarly but have larger stems and leaves (Gubbels et al., 1990).<P> New large-seeded buckwheat varieties 'Mancan' and 'Manor' developed in Canada feature large leaves and stems and vigorous growth.  Experiments are also being conducted using semi-dwarf types of buckwheat, for resistance to lodging (Gubbels and Campbell, 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is very sensitive to frost; therefore, seeding in Manitoba is delayed until early June (Gubbels et al., 1990).  In Manitoba, seed production is greatest with early June seedings; delay leads to declining yield; infection by downy mildew was greater with delayed seedings of buckwheat (Gubbels et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Infection by downy mildew (<I>Peronospora ducometi</I></B>) was greater with delayed seedings of buckwheat.  Application of fungicide (metalaxyl, 25% wp) to control this parthogen did not increase seed yield of buckwheat (Gubbels et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Buckwheat seed should be harvested at the time when flowering has almost ceased and 75% of the seed have turned brown (Gubbels and Campbell, 1985). This crop is subject to plant breakage and seed shattering due to high winds; wind also interferes with pollination by flying insects; however, benefits from windbreaks of corn were not consistent (Gubbels, 1985).  Application of fungicide (metalaxyl, 25% wp) to control downy mildew (<I>Peronospora ducometi</I></B>) did not increase seed yield of buckwheat (Gubbels et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Old cultivars of buckwheat are 'Tempest' and 'Tokyo,' which are small seeded and mature during midseason.  The large-seeded varieties 'Mancan' and 'Manor' are now prevalent and mature similarly but have larger stems and leaves (Gubbels et al., 1990). Maturation of some seeds occurs within about 50 days of sowing; some flowering can continue for an additional 70 days (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is subject to plant breakage and seed shattering due to high winds; wind also interferes with pollination by flying insects.  However, benefits from windbreaks of corn were not consistent (Gubbels, 1985). Buckwheat is grown as an economic crop in the northern Great Plains and as a cover crop in much of the United States, including the northeastern U.S.  and California.  It has been regarded as a "poor man's crop" because it can do well on poor soil (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Buckwheat (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The seed of buckwheat is a three-sided achene that is smooth, shining, and 5 mm long (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Germination occurs about 4 days after seeding (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Buckwheat apparently tolerates a wide range of soil pH (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Buckwheat appears intolerant of shade (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available on salinity tolerance of buckwheat.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No information is available on herbicide sensitivity of buckwheat.<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>The following account is from Bugg (pers. comm.), except where otherwise noted.  Buckwheat is a quick-germinating, warm season annual broadleafed plant.  Germination occurs within 4 days after seeding, flowering occurs about 30 days after seeding, and insect visitation to the flowers is profuse.  Seed maturation can occur about 14 days after flowering begins, and flowering may last 45 days or more (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).  Even with adequate soil moisture, the shallow-rooted buckwheat shows mid-day wilting if weather is warm.  Insect visitation typically ceases when wilting occurs (Pellett, 1976). Recovery typically occurs at night, and insect visitation resumes the following morning.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is not a legume and requires no inoculation.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Buckwheat is readily available from many seed dealers.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Buckwheat normally shows an erect growth habit (Munz, 1973), but under some conditions may appear decumbent (Bugg,.pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Growers observing the mid-day wilting of a buckwheat cover crop may be tempted to irrigate excessively.  This should be avoided, because buckwheat actually needs little water (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>

<h1 align=center>Query Language Help</h1>
<p>Using the query page, you can do a full-text search for a word or phrase on a Web site. Searches produce a list of files that 
contain the word or phrase anywhere in their text. </p>
<p>The rules for formulating queries are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple consecutive words are treated as a phrase; they must appear in the same order within a matching document.</li>
<li>Queries are case-insensitive, so you can type your query in uppercase or lowercase. </li>
<li>You can search for any word except for those in the exception list (for English, this includes <em>a</em>, <em>an</em>, <em>and</em>, <em>as</em>, and other 
common words), which are ignored during a search. </li>
<li>Words in the exception list are treated as placeholders in phrase and proximity queries. </li>
<li>Punctuation marks such as the period (.), colon (:), semicolon (;), and comma (,) are ignored during a search. </li>
<li>To use specially treated characters such as &amp;, |, ^, #, @, $, (, ), in a query, enclose your query in quotation marks (&quot;). </li>
<li>You can use <a href="#Operators">Boolean operators</a> (and, or, not) and the <a href="#Operators">proximity operator</a> (near) to specify additional search 
information. </li>
<li>The <a href="#Wildcards">wildcard character</a> (*) can be used to match words with a given prefix. The query <tt>esc*</tt> matches the terms &#147;ESC,&#148; 
&#147;escape,&#148; and so on. </li>
<li><a href="#FreeTextQueries">Free-text queries</a> can be specified without regard to query syntax. </li>
<li><a href="#VectorQueries">Vector space queries</a> can be specified. </li>
<li>Activex&#153; (OLE) and file attribute <a href="#PropertyValueQueries">property value queries</a> can be issued.</li>

<p>Hints: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can use parentheses to nest expressions within a query. The expressions in parentheses are evaluated before the 
rest of the query. </li>
<li>Use double quotes (&quot;) to indicate that a Boolean or Near operator keyword should be ignored in your query. For 
example, &quot;Abbot and Costello&quot; will match pages with the phrase, not pages that match the Boolean expression. </li>
<li>The Near operator returns a match if the words are within 50 words of each other. </li>
<li>The Not operator can be used only after an And operator in content queries; it can be used only to exclude pages that 
match a previous content restriction. For property value queries, the Not operator can be used apart from the And 
operator. </li>

<ul>
<li>Be sure to use the pound (#) character before the property name when using a regular expression in a property value, 
and an &#147;at&#148; (@) character otherwise. The equal (=) relational operator is assumed for regular expression queries. </li>
<li>File name (#filename) is the only property that supports regular expressions with wildcards to the <i>left</i> of text. 
Wildcards in regular-expressions for all other properties must come after a prefix. </li>
<li>Date and time values are of the form <em>yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss</em>. The first two characters of the year and the entire time can 
be omitted. Dates and times are in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). </li>
<li>Dates and times relative to the current time can be expressed with a minus (-) character followed by zero or more 
integer and time unit pairs. Time units are expressed as: (y) for years, (m) for months, (w) for weeks, (d) for days, (h) 
for hours, (n) for minutes, and (s) for seconds. </li>
<li>Currency values are of the form <em>x.y</em>, where <em>x</em> is the whole value amount and <em>y</em> is the fractional amount. There is no 
assumption about units. </li>
<li>Boolean values are (t) or (true) for true and (f) or (false) for false. </li>
<li>Vectors (VT_VECTOR) are expressed as an opening brace ({), a comma-separated list of values, then a closing brace

<p>Regular expressions in property queries are defined as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any character except *, ., ?, and | defaults to matching just itself. </li>
<li>Regular expressions can be enclosed in matching quotes (&quot;), and must be enclosed in quotes if they contain a space ( ) 
or closing parenthesis ()). </li>
<li>The characters *, ., and ? behave as they behave in Windows; they match any number of characters, match (.) or end of 
sentence, and match any one character, respectively.</li>
<li>The character | is an escape character. After |, the following characters have special meaning: <ul>
<li>( opens a group. Must be followed by a matching ).</li>
<li>) closes a group. Must be preceded by a matching (. </li>
<li>[ opens a character class. Must be followed by a matching (un-escaped) ]. </li>
<li>{ opens a counted match. Must be followed by a matching }. </li>
<li>} closes a counted match. Must be preceded by a matching {. </li>
<li>, separates OR clauses. </li>
<li>* matches zero or more occurrences of preceding expression.</li>
<li>? matches zero or one occurrences of preceding expression.</li>
<li>+ matches one or more occurrences of preceding expression. </li>
<li>Anything else, including |, matches itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Between [ and ] the following characters have special meaning: <ul>
<li>^ matches everything but following classes. Must be the first character. </li>
<li>] matches ]. May only be preceded by ^, otherwise it closes the class. </li>
<li>- range operator. Preceded and followed by normal characters.</li>
<li>Anything else matches itself (or begins or ends a range at itself). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Between { and } the following syntax applies: <ul>
<li>|{m|} matches exactly <em>m</em> occurrences of the preceding expression. (0 &lt; m &lt; 256). </li>
<li>|{m,|} matches at least <em>m</em> occurrences of the preceding expression. (1 &lt; m &lt; 256). </li>
<li>|{m,n|} matches between <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> occurrences of the preceding expression, inclusive. (0 &lt; m &lt; 256, 0 &lt; n &lt; 256).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To match *, ., and ?, enclose them in brackets (for example, <tt>|[*]sample</tt> will match &quot;<tt>*sample</tt>&quot;).</li>

Many cvs developed in Australia; Hannaford' is the cv mainly used in California<LI>
16" tall<LI>
Biomass 8,000 lb/acre<LI>
N content 1.2%<LI>
Flowers April-May<LI>
Has re-established itself well in almond orchards of Merced County, but not in Mendocino County vineyards.</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>'Jemalong', 'Sephi', and 'Paraggio' are mid-season-maturing, varieties; the former is an old variety, whereas the latter two are new (Miller et al., 1989).  Other commercially-available varieties include 'Hannaford,' 'Cyprus,' 'Cyfield,' 'Borung,' 'Ghor,' 'Akbar,' and 'Ascot' (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>For 'Jemalong', seed yields of 300 to 675 lbs/acre were obtained in an established stand in San Luis Obispo County (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).  Mackay and Barnard (1981) found that 'Sephi' is superior in seed yield to aphid-susceptible cultivars under attack by blue green aphids and spotted alfalfa aphid.  When compared with 'Jemalong' and 'Paraggio,' 'Sephi' yielded significantly more seed.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Egyptian alfalfa weevil is a pest on medics.  Some of the newer cultivars show improved resistance.  Here are ratings from Weitkamp and Graves (1988): Good tolerance - 'Sephi;' Fair tolerance - 'Jemalong,' 'Ghor,' 'Ascot,' 'Paraggio;' Poor tolerance - 'Hannaford,' 'Cyprus,' 'Cyfield,' 'Borung,' 'Akbar.'<P> 'Sephi' has high levels of resistance to both the spotted alfalfa aphid and blue green aphid but is susceptible to pea aphid.  Its resistance to blue green aphids is equal to or greater than that of any other cultivar of barrel medic in field and green tests (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Days to flowering for several varieties were given by Weitkamp and Graves (1988): 'Akbar', 91; 'Ascot', 100; 'Borung', 95; 'Cyfield', 96; 'Cyprus', 78.  Mackay and Barnard (1981) stated that 'Cyprus' flowers approximately 80 days after fall planting, whereas Murphy et al.  (1976) stated that it flowers in January, and Quinlivan et al.  that it flowers about 11 weeks after germination. Weitkamp and Graves (1988) state that 'Ghor' requires 90 days, 'Hannaford' 99, 'Jemalong' 105, 'Paraggio' 105, and 'Sephi' 105 (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).  'Ghor' is mentioned as very early flowering; it begins flowering about two weeks earlier than 'Cyprus' or at about 9 weeks after germination (Quinlivan et al.). 'Hannaford' flowers 3-4 weeks after 'Cyprus' Barrel (Murphy et al. 1976), with the interval from germination to flowering stated as about 14 weeks (Quinlivan et al.).  'Jemalong' was mentioned as flowering 3-4 weeks after Cyprus Barrel (Murphy et al.  1976) and about a week after 'Hannaford', or about 12 weeks after germination (Quinlivan et al.).  'Sephi' flowers up to a week earlier than Jemalong (Mackay and Barnard. 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>'Paraggio' shows better seedling vigor than does 'Jemalong' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Bugg et al. (unpublished data) found that dry above-ground biomass for 'Hannaford' was 7.782+/-0.791 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M), in Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  When weeds were included, the figures were 8.739+/-0.417.<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) found that early winter herbage production for 'Paraggio' was significantly greater than for 'Jemalong', approximately 2,910 kg/ha. compared to 1,140 kg./ha. 'Paraggio' produced more herbage than 'Jemalong' and the mean of 56 other genotypes and was expected to increase the annual medic content of pastures over all except the lowest rainfall areas (less than 300 mm).  'Sephi', when compared with all currently available annual medic cultivars over a wide range of environments and herbage yield, was equal to or better than 'Jemalong,' 'Cyprus,' 'Paraggio' and 10 other aphid-resistant lines (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>'Paraggio' shows good field tolerance of the spotted alfalfa aphid beyond the seedling stage, is tolerant to very tolerant to blue green aphid, but is susceptible to pea aphid (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>'Hannaford' and 'Cyprus' do well on alkaline soils or soils with a high content of available lime (Quinlivan et al.).  Murphy et al. (1976) mentioned that 'Hannaford' prefers medium to light alkaline soils, whereas 'Cyprus' does well on heavy soils and 'Jemalong' on calcareous, sandy soils.  'Jemalong' is considered superior to 'Hannaford' on many light calcareous sandy soils (Quinlivan et al.).  'Paraggio' is adapted to a range of soil types from neutral to alkaline sands and sandy loams to heavy textured, red brown earth and clay loam soils (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>The species has hairy stems and leaves; leaves are trifoliate, with oval leaflets, and the widest part towards the apex, which may be truncated or rounded.  The leaves may be all green, or have distinctive purple blotches, features which have been used for cultivar identification.  There are usually one or two flowers (or up to four in cv.  'Borung') on a hairy stalk which is shorter than the stalk of the corresponding leaf.  Lobes of the floral calyx are very long and reach almost to the tips of the petals. The pods or burrs are barrel shaped, coiling clockwise or anticlockwise, and 4.5 to ll mm high, with three to seven coils which are strongly pressed together and thickened at maturity. Young burrs are hairy. Spines are variable: they may be short and thick at the base and pressed against the sides of the burr or longer and thinner and protruded at a slight angle.  In cv 'Cyfield' and some naturalized material, the pods are spineless. The burrs have characteristic indentations along the margins of the coils between the spines, the presence of which distinguishes <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> from <I>M. littoralis</I></B>, but these indentations may be obscured by strong thickening at maturity (Quinlivan et al.).  'Borung' has clusters of three or four flowers, whereas most other cultivars have only two or three, and the burrs are smaller than in the other cultivars (Quinlivan et al.).  'Cyprus' comprises several strains; the dominant strain is identical in appearance to cv 'Hannaford' and forms some 98% of the total in any stand.  The main minor strain has, in the center of each leaflet, a dark purple-brown patch which is prominent during the winter but fades as the plants approach maturity (Quinlivan et al.).  'Hannaford' resembles 'Cyprus' in that leaflets are unmarked and pods coil in a clockwise direction (Quinlivan et al.).<P> 'Jemalong' resembles 'Hannaford' and 'Cyprus' but is distinguished by the leaflet's central purple-brown patch which is prominent during the winter but disappears in the spring. 'Jemalong' also differs in that the pod is coiled in an anti-clockwise direction, while those of the other 'Cyprus' and 'Hannaford' coil clockwise (Quinlivan et al.).<P> Closely resembling 'Hannaford,' 'Paraggio' is a typical representative of the species.  Purple leaf flecking does not penetrate to the abaxial surface as in 'Borung' but is similar to 'Hannaford.' 'Paraggio' has clockwise pod coiling and a similar range of pod coil numbers to 'Hannaford' (3.5-5.25).  Paraggio pods are slightly heavier (about 10,000 per kg).  Pod spininess is rated as equal to 'Hannaford' and 'Jemalong' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Sephi' is a mixture of two components, which are morphologically distinguished only by a difference in markings on the abaxial surfaces of the leaflets.  Eighty per cent of the plants have a lighter green "watermark" blotch mostly edged with brown on the distal part of the leaflets.  The remaining 20% have a brown blotch on the mid-lower part of the leaflets.  Both leaf markers disappear later in the life of the plant and may not be expressed during the warmer months of the year.  The other main distinguishing feature of 'Sephi' is the pod, which is relatively squat with its length rarely exceeding its width.  It contains 3 or 4 clockwise coils. The spines are somewhat longer and larger than those of 'Jemalong', have a rating of 12, but are considerably shorter than those of 'Ascot.' Spines of 'Sephi' have a similar curve to those of 'Akbar' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>'Cyprus' is somewhat salt tolerant, and 'Hannaford' has done well in Australia on heavy clay loam soils which in their virgin state have a relatively high soil salinity (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Christensen (1971) proposed winter cover crops for Californian vineyards with the aim of producing a sod-like condition.  Cover crops should be low growing, require little or no mowing, and be self re-seeding.  Their functions would be to reduce tillage and dust, provide habitat for predators that attack spider mites, improve water penetration, and provide nitrogen.  Medics suggestions were California bur clover, 'Cyprus' barrel medic, and 'Harbinger' barrel medic.  Medics are recommended in mixture with subclovers in some areas (see subterranean clover section) (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Crawford and Nankivell (1989) evaluated the annual medics, <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa', <I>M scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', and <I>M. truncatula</I></B> cvs 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong' in 3 rotational systems. <I>Medicago</I></B> spp.  re-established better under permanent pasture than under any rotational scheme involving tillage.  Seed preservation, however, was better in rotations involving tillage.  <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa,' in rotation trials, produced a higher seed yield in the year of sowing than did <I>M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson' or <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvv 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong'.  However, its seed bank persisted only 3 years, and its re-establishment was poor, perhaps due to its higher proportion of permeable seed. <I>Medicago truncatula</I></B> cv 'Jemalong' maintained higher seed reserves after six years of cropping than <I> M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Cyprus' or <I>M. scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson'.  Seed banks of all species were exhausted after 7 years.  Natural regeneration by 'Paraggio' from residual seed was better than of 'Jemalong' under both sprayed and unsprayed conditions (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Barrel medic is a cool-season annual (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Medics are low growing (6-16" dependent on species) (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Being winter annuals, they dry up early and re-seed leaving a small amount of mulch for water conservation and weed control (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  'Jemalong' has a semi-erect growth habit that is purported to give it better winter production potential (Quinlivan et al.), and 'Sephi' in turn has a slightly more erect habit than 'Jemalong' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981). 'Paraggio' has a growth habit that is slightly more erect than that of 'Hannaford' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Barrel medic has unique barrel-shaped seed pods (Peaceful Valley, 1988) or burrs, each containing from four to eight yellowish-brown, kidney shaped seeds.  Seeds are 2.5 to 4 mm long and 1.5 to 2.5 mm wide and separated from each other in the burr by thin partitions (Quinlivan et al.).  For cv 'Cyprus', there are 125,000 seeds/lb (Murphy et al., 1976); for 'Hannaford' there are about 12,700 pods per kg and about 250,000 seeds per kg (Mackay and Barnard, 1981); and 'Hannaford' was estimated as having about 110,000 seeds/lb by Murphy et al. (1976).  For 'Jemalong,' there are 110,000 seeds/lb (Murphy et al., 1976); for 'Paraggio' about 220,000 seeds per kg (Mackay and Barnard, 1981); and for 'Sephi' about 7-9 seed per pod and 260,00 seeds per kg (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Barrel medic is a better choice for areas where rainfall is insufficient for true clovers (<I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.); that is where rainfall is less than 20" annually (Peaceful Valley, 1988). 'Cyprus' does well in regions receiving 10-16 inches; 'Hannaford', 10 -20" (Murphy et al., 1976).  'Jemalong' and 'Sephi' have shown excellent adaptation to both low and high rainfall (8-21 inches annually) (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988), but 10 -17" is considered optimal for 'Jemalong' (Murphy et al., 1976).  'Paraggio' is adapted to rainfall of from 13.78 to 19.67 inches (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>According to Peaceful Valley (1988), barrel medic is excellent for dryland orchards, vineyards, or crops with limited summer water (e.g., under drip & low volume irrigated crops) and is also suited for overseeding into bermuda grass lawns for winter color.  It is credited with having excellent feed value and with being useful for planting in polycultures with grains (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  The very early flowering and rapid winter growth of cv 'Ghor' suggest its possible use in dry regions (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Barrel medic is regarded as early maturing (February-April) (Peaceful Valley, 1988), with cvv 'Borung' and 'Sephi' maturing about the same time as 'Jemalong' (Quinlivan et al.; Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Barrel medic requires neutral to alkaline pH (6.8 to 9.0) (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Murphy et al. (1976) stated that 'Cyprus,' 'Hannaford,'and 'Jemalong' grow well given soil pH of 7-9.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Inoculation improves seedling emergence, N fixation, and growth (Peaceful Valley, 1988); the inoculant type is "Medicago Special Culture 1" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez. 1980).  'Paraggio' nodulates effectively with commercially-available peat cultures of <I>Rhizobium</I></B> appropriate for barrel medics (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Peaceful Valley (1988) recommended sowing rates of from 8-15 lb/acre, whereas Miller et al. (1989) suggested 15 to 20 lbs/acre.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Seed in fall (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Peaceful Valley (1988) advised a sowing depth of 1/2-3/4 inches.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Clarkson et al.  (1989) found that a single application of sulfur and phosphorus (both at 40 kg/ha) to a traprock soil (a shallow gravelly loam, pH 6.7) increased yield of barrel medic five-fold for the three years of the study.  Dry matter yields rose from 400 to 2300 kg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Weed dry above-ground biomass (chickweed, shepherdspurse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass) in plots seeded to 'Hannaford' was 0.958+/-0.532 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  in an organic vineyard at Hopland, Mendocino County, California. Vegetational cover by the medic was 95.00+/-2.04 % based on visual inspection in early May (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Barrel medics succeed in Mediterranean climates, with cool, moist winters and long, hot, dry summers (Quinlivan et al., no date).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Medics originated around the Mediterranean basin, and require long, hot, dry summers, and winter rain (Quinlivan et al., no date).  In general, medics require a mediterranean climate with 250-500 mm of mainly winter rain (Quinlivan et al., no date). Barrel medic is widely naturalized in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia (Quinlivan et al., no date).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Glenn McGourty seeded cv 'Hannaford' barrel medic in a vineyard by disking twice to prepare the seedbed, broadcasting the inoculated seed, and incorporating with a cultipacker (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cost is approximately $1.65 to $1.75 per pound retail (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).  Cv 'Sephi' cost 1.53 per lb retail in 1993 (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Most medics produce hard seed (Quinlivan et al., no date), which suggests that seed have long-term viability in storage, but no specific information was available on this point.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Height of cv 'Hannaford' was 40.01+/-1.91 cm (mean +/- S.E.M.) during early May in an organic vineyard in Hopland, Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Like most legumes, barrel medic has a taproot-dominated root system (Bugg, pers. comm.), and root systems of medics are generally deeper than those of subterranean clovers (Quinlivan et al., no date)<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Glenn McGourty seeded cv 'Hannaford' barrel medic in an organic vineyard in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, by disking twice to prepare the seedbed, broadcasting the inoculated seed, and incorporating with a cultipacker (Bugg, pers. comm.). This was followed by 1 inch of overhead irrigation.  Establshment was excellent.<P> According to Fred Thomas (pers. comm.), medics fare relatively well when there is some early autumn rain followed by a dry spell, because medic root elongation is rapid.  By contrast, subterranena clover roots elongate more slowly, and those clovers benefit from more consisten soil moisture.<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>According to Rick Miller (pers. comm.), medics can tolerate close mowing if it is applied consistently.  However, if the plants are allowed to grow erect and then mowed closely during spring, seed set can be greatly reduced.  By contrast, subterranean clovers can tolerate extremely close mowing, consistent or occasional, and still set seed.<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Barrel medic may be incorporated like any other annual cover crop.  There are no special requirements, but tillage may place seed too deep to ensure stand regeneration. (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Seed pods can presumably be harvested by sweeping, as with bur medic (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>No unusual equipment is needed in maintaining or harvesting barrel medic (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>For bur medic, mean protein content is 19% by weight (Duke, 1981) and 6.25% of the protein is assumed to be N.  Projecting from the biomass figures observed by Bugg et al. (unpublished) for cv 'Hannaford' barrel medic, 7.782+/-0.791 Mg/ha, the N yield probably was about 92.41 +/- 9.39 kg N/ha.<P> Materon and Danso (1991) found that in northern Syria, cv 'Jemalong' at the high seeding rate (500 seeds/m-2) yielded mean a nitrogen content of 89.3 kg N/ha (75.51 obtained from fixation, herbage yield 4.558 Mg/ha) when seed was inoculated with <I>Rhizobium</I></B> strain WSM244, and 71.8  kg N/ha (57.07 obtained from fixation,herbage yield 3.734 Mg/ha) with strain CC169. Uninoculated 'Jemalong' contained 30.4 kg N/ha (18.71 obtained from fixation, herbage yield 1.417 Mg/ha).  The inferred N-fixation figures were based on data from control plots seeded to annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B>). On the whole, cv 'Jemalong' produced only about one-third as much biomass as did <I>Medicago rigidula</I></B> L., selection 716.  The latter derived on average about 91% of its N from fixation, and at high seeding rates contained 93.1 kg N/ha (WSM244), 112.6 kg N/ha (CC169), and 100.7 kg N/ha. Respective herbage yields were 5.460 Mg/ha, 5.449 Mg/ha, and 5.116 Mg/ha<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>No specific information is available on the effects on water by barrel medic.  With their deeper taproots, medics might be expected to deplete soil moisture at depth more than do subterranean clovers (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Most medics have low concentrations of oestrogenic compounds. However, leaves and pods of cvv 'Cyprus,' 'Jemmalong,' and 'Hannaford' sometimes contain coumestan, especially 4-methoxy coumesterol, an oestrogenic compound that may induce abortions in sheep (Quilivan et al., no date).<P>

free from the UC SAREP office at (916) 752-7556. It will also
be available for viewing in county extension offices throughout
the state. SAREP has funded more than 127 grants for over $2.5
million dollars since the program was established in 1987.<B>
Jill</B> <B>Shore Auburn</B>, SAREP acting director, noted that
SAREP addresses many issues in the agriculture community, including
sustainable soil management, farming with reduced use of chemicals
and greater use of biological controls, biotechnology, and the
safety of the food supply. <BR>

<P>
Getting information to the agricultural community is SAREP's primary
goal. SAREP provides information from research projects and many
other sources to farmers throughout the state. It produces print
and electronic publications, videos, and workshops. <BR>

<H1>Grad Students, Sustainable Ag Meetings Funded</H1>
<P>
Seven graduate students and 12 sustainable agriculture seminars
and field demonstrations have been funded by UC SAREP for a total
of $26,285.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Supporting graduate students and meetings is a good way
for us to use scarce resources,&quot; said<B> Bill</B> <B>Liebhardt</B>,
SAREP director.<BR>
<P>
Liebhardt said SAREP funds will help graduate students address
critical issues facing agricultural producers and society.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The grants are a way to stimulate and encourage activity
among students interested in sustainability who are beginning
their careers,&quot; he said.  &quot;This is a way for us to continue
supporting innovative research, and it allows us to complement
already existing money in the University.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Liebhardt said the meeting grants &quot;are to encourage people
within the Cooperative Extension system and the greater agricultural
community to independently pull together resources and information
on sustainability and disseminate it rapidly to their new and
established audiences across the state.&quot;<BR>
<P>
He said SAREP is announcing a Request for Proposals for similar
grants for next year (see &quot;Sources of Funding,&quot; page
10).<BR>
<P>
A total of $13,290 has been awarded to the following graduate
students:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Charles Griffin</B>, Department of Vegetable Crops, UC
Davis, $1,990 for &quot;A Cover Crop Growth Model&quot;;

<H1>Owl Nest Box Construction<BR>
</H1>
<P>
There are many different methods of constructing barn owl nest
boxes.  Almost any closed box with a suitable hole in the front
will suffice.  Boxes can be installed in trees or on tall poles;
they can even be placed inside barn walls, with a hole in the
wall serving as the entrance.<BR>
<P>
<B>In Trees</B>.  The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has produced
plans and instruction for building barn owl nest boxes in trees
(Figure 1).  Ideal tree species include oak and sycamore.  Boxes
should be hung or mounted 15 to 30 feet above ground, using six
boxes per square mile.  The building material can be 3/8-inch
or 1/2-inch plywood, assembled with marine-grade plastic resin
or exterior wood glue.  The top is hinged to aid cleaning.  The
entrance is 12 inches tall.  Boxes should be painted with drab
green, black and brown to reduce human disturbance.  A two-inch
layer of sawdust or wood chips is placed in the bottom of the
box; the shavings are replaced each year.
<P>
<B>On Poles</B>.  Hilmar farmer Bill Genn has mounted nest boxes
15 to 25 feet high on utility poles. His boxes are 18 to 24 inches
in each dimension with a six-inch opening.  He faces the open
end to the east away from the sun and prevailing wind.  He also
uses a double west wall with a couple of inches of space between
walls and a shade over the roof to keep the nests cooler. Shavings
are placed on the bottom for nesting material.
<P>
<B>In Barns</B>.  Barn owls, of course, like to nest in barns.
 The Illinois Audubon Society recommends placing nesting boxes
inside barn walls, 20 to 25 feet high, with a six-inch square
entrance hole cut into the wall.  (See Figure 2.)  The barn wall
acts as the front of the box.  The top is hinged but kept securely
latched.  The box is nailed against the interior barn wall, and
if necessary, is supported with wire or additional boards.<BR>

<H1>UC Small Farm Program:  Resource for Farmers, Gardeners<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>Preliminary results of the </I><B>Sustainable
Agriculture News</B> <I>mailing update indicate that many readers
are interested in information aimed at small-scale farmers and
gardeners.  The following article profiles the UC Small Farm Program,
a major resource for California's small-scale farmers.  It is
adapted from the program's report &quot;The UC Small Farm Program:
The First Fifteen Years,&quot;  edited by<B> </B></I><B>John Stumbos</B>.
<BR>
<P>
California is perhaps the only state that has established within
its Land Grant/Cooperative Extension system a program funded specifically
to address the needs of small-scale and limited resource farmers.
 The Small Farm Program began in 1979 with a state appropriation
to Cooperative Extension to provide assistance to the more than
three-fourths of California farmers who have limited resources
and income.  Of the 80,000 farms in California, more than 60,000
can be classified as small, regardless of which of several definitions
is used.  Although 10 percent of the state's largest farms produce
more than 90 percent of its food and fiber, small farms have a
tremendous impact on the state economy.  They are responsible
for much of the state's agricultural diversity and much of the
leadership for sustainable agriculture, environmental quality
and food safety.  Small farmers are a broad mix of ethnic and
social groups.  A significant number of small farmers are Hispanic
vegetable growers and organic farmers, although new groups with
different needs have appeared on the scene, including the Hmong,
Cambodians, Thai and Laotians who fled political unrest in Southeast
Asia.<BR>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of small-scale farmers are likely to be full
owners of the farm they operate, compared to less than 50 percent
of large-scale farmers (more than $100,000 gross annual sales).
 More than 65 percent of small farmers live on their farms.  The
1982 Census of Agriculture showed that 41,000 small farms with
gross sales of $2,500<I> </I>to $100,000 made up half the number
of farms in the state; another 25,000 had gross sales of less
than $2,500.  These farms produced more than $1 billion in sales
annually; they operated 31 percent of the state's total farmland
and represented 56<I> </I>percent of all fruit and nut tree farms.
<BR>
<P>
The Small Farm Program's 15-year report notes that &quot;Small
farmers have proven themselves a resilient, innovative sector
of agriculture.  Many have found marketing niches for products
in high demand and/or low supply, and California small farmers
lead the nation by virtue of their close proximity to urban centers
and tremendous marketing opportunities provided by diverse ethnic
groups and trend-setting consumer demands.&quot;
<H3>Program Focus</H3>
<P>
The purpose of the UC Small Farm Program is to benefit small farmers
and marketers and the natural and renewable resources they depend
upon.  It does this through a variety of educational means that
are linked to research-based information in numerous academic
disciplines ranging from pest management to marketing and engineering.
 The program's highest priorities are specialty crop production,
direct marketing, organic and sustainable agriculture, entry-level
farming, and ethnic farmers.  Land use and other rural-urban interface
issues and animal production-marketing systems are becoming increasingly
important issues.
<H3>Staff</H3>
<P>
The program has developed into a statewide network of farm advisors,
campus-based specialists, faculty and staff who contribute to
the education and research needs of small farmers.  <B>Ron Voss</B>,
UC Davis extension vegetable specialist, is the part-time director
of the Small Farm Program; associate director <B>Claudia Myers</B>
is in charge of day-to-day activities. The nucleus of the program
is the Small Farm Center located on the UC Davis campus.  A staff
of five serves as a clearinghouse of information for county advisors,
farmers, direct marketers, governments agencies and the public.
 Throughout the state several UC Cooperative Extension advisors
are specifically assigned to small farm clientele; to some extent
most of the state's county extension offices work with small farm
clientele.
<H3>Events</H3>
<P>
The Small Farm Program co-sponsors numerous conferences and events
each year.  In 1990 those events included:  Farm Conference, a
statewide event focused on production and marketing techniques
for small-scale growers and markers; Women in Agriculture conference;
bilingual strawberry production meetings; Rare Fruit Symposium;
sustainable agriculture advisor training; Farmer-to-Consumer Conference
For the Lower Sacramento Valley; and Tasting of Summer Produce
events at the Oakland Festival-At-The Lake and the San Francisco
Fair.
<H3>Publications</H3>
<P>
The Center maintains a library of books, scientific journals,
reports, directories, and magazines on crop production,   marketing,
  farm management, soil and water, energy, integrated   pest 
 management, agricultural engineering, specialty crops, rural
sociology, organic farming and sustainable agriculture.<BR>
<P>
It produces a free bimonthly newsletter <I>Small Farm News </I>with
profiles of small farms and farm advisors, reviews of publications
and a calendar of state, national and international events.<BR>
<P>
Eight additional free publications are available from the Center
including booklets on exotic livestock, foliage plants, herbs,
shitake mushrooms, organics in farmers markets (statistics), 
 sheep, specialty vegetables, and wildflowers.<BR>
<P>
The Center produces publications for its <I>Family Farm Series,
</I>including inexpensive ($2 to $3.50)<I> </I>publications on
statistics and resources, marketing,  farm  management, vegetable
production and an organic farming directory.  The series is available
from ANR Publications, University of California, 6701 San Pablo
Ave., Oakland, CA 94608-1239, or (415)<I> </I>642-2431.<BR>
<P>
The Center also offers help to UC farm advisors developing local
and regional programs for small-scale growers and marketers. 
The staff helps advisors identify grants, organize and coordinate
conferences, conduct information searches, edit publications and
find other sources of information.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>LISA Project</H3>
<P>
The Small Farm Center is also coordinating a USDA Low-Input Sustainable
Agriculture (LISA) project.  Project goals are to produce practical
information based on LISA production, marketing, and food quality
research; to determine the effectiveness of various education
methods in the adoption of LISA practices; and to determine the
market potential for various farming practices and develop educational
materials based on these findings.  The center is working with
SAREP; UC extension specialists; extension representatives from
the University of Idaho, Oregon State University, Washington State
University, and the University of Arizona; the Committee for Sustainable
Agriculture (CSA); and the UC Agricultural Publications office.
<BR>
<P>
As part of the LISA project, the Small Farm Center is sponsoring
<I>Organic '92 </I>in cooperation with CSA January 22-23, 1992
at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove.  The symposium,
which immediately precedes the Ecological Farming Conference,
will present information on organic farming theory and practice
including academic research and practical farming experience.
<BR>
<P>
An important product of the symposium will be published proceedings,
which will be the basis for an organic farming handbook.  A call
for papers/presentations has been issued for organic farming topics
including  practices,  research, marketing and related subjects
that have practical application for organic  farmers.  Farmers,
 researchers, consultants, regulators and educators are invited
to send a suggested topic or title with a brief description to
the Small Farm Center by April 12, 1991.

<H1>$2 Million Kellogg Grant Creates California Alliance for Sustainable
Agriculture<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Funded by a three-year, $2 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation,
the California Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (CASA) has
been formed to move the state toward more sustainable food and
agricultural systems. The new coalition is one of seven model
projects funded by Kellogg around the United States as part of
its Integrated Farming Systems Initiative. <BR>

<P>
The grant provides a unique opportunity to build a productive
collaboration between the University of California and innovative
non-profit groups. In addition to SAREP members of the coalition
include the Bio-Integral Resource Center (BIRC), California Institute
for Rural Studies (CIRS), Community Alliance with Family Farmers
(CAFF), Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission (LWWC), Rural Development
Center (RDC), UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
and UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program. <BR>

<P>
&quot;The formidable task of redirecting agriculture policy and
practice onto a more environmentally sound and socially just path
will occur only if diverse groups find ways to work together,&quot;
notes <B>Sheila Daar</B> of BIRC: &quot;We need to draw upon the
talents, vision, and commitment of people across the entire spectrum
of food and agricultural systems if we are to evolve realistic
alternatives that will sustain our society into the next century
and beyond.&quot; <BR>

<P>
SAREP's economic and public policy analyst,<B> <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A></B>,
will be working with other members of CASA to identify and implement
concrete strategies for linking sustainable agriculture to rural
community economic and social development. Information will be
gathered from community roundtable discussions, lighthouse farm
observations (successful examples), and from previously funded
SAREP economic and public policy projects. The result will be
a document outlining policy recommendations and promising strategies
for rural community decision-makers and community leaders. <BR>

<P>
Other activities planned by CASA are community discussions to
identify barriers to sustainable food and agricultural systems,
collaboration with innovative growers to create &quot;how to&quot;
guides for reducing chemical use on farms, organization of broad-based
community coalitions that work toward marketing and public policy
innovations, and a program to identify and train emerging agricultural
leaders. <BR>

<P>
CASA members will work directly with farmers to find better ways
of growing and marketing crops grown with fewer or no chemicals.
For example, LWWC is using a marketing commission form of organization
to inform its 650 winegrape grower members about sustainable winegrape
production in the San Joaquin Valley. CIRS is encouraging organic
cotton production by forging an industry-wide coalition that links
growers, marketers, environmentalists, and pest control advisers.
<BR>

<P>
A fundamental commitment of the project is to work together with
people involved in the many aspects of food and agriculture. CASA
views diversity as an asset and believes no one should be excluded
from the task of developing an ecologically based and socially
responsible agriculture. As <B>Patricia Allen</B> of the Agroecology
Program explains, &quot;We need to give a voice to under-heard
elements, especially women and people of color, and to seek food
and agricultural systems which directly address social issues
of hunger, gender and ethnic equality, and economic justice.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
The California project is the largest of the seven funded nationally
by the Kellogg Foundation. Kellogg funding will facilitate information
networking among all the projects, and help project leaders work
together to address policy, economic, and information bafflers
to more sustainable food and agricultural systems. Kellogg has
committed more than $8.1 million during the first phase of its
Integrated Farming System Initiative. A second round of similar
Kellogg grants is anticipated during the coming year.  <BR>

<P>
In addition to CASA, community demonstration projects funded by
Kellogg include:
<UL>
<LI> The Alternative Energy Resources Organization in Helena,
Montana; to increase resource conservation and foster economically
viable family farms and rural communities.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The Arkansas Land and Farm Development Corporation in Brinkly;
to help farmers identify and adopt ecologically sound and sustainable
crop and livestock systems and increase farmer and community understanding
and support for integrated farming systems.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The Kansas Rural Center in Whiting; to empower farmers and
rural communities to develop and practice integrated farming systems
that balance profit with resource conservation. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The Nature Conservancy in Arlington, Virginia; to empower
the agricultural community of the Big Darby watershed to implement
economically and ecologically sound land-use practices.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The Practical Farmers of Iowa; to develop a model to help
rural communities provide the support, guidance, and teamwork
needed for acceptance and use of sustainable farming systems.
 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI> The Rodale Institute Research Center in Kutztown, Pennsylvania;
to develop a regional infrastructure model for sustainable agriculture
as a prototype for farmers, policymakers, marketing and technical
support professionals, and consumers.  
</UL>

<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>This is an aggressive annual grass (SCS, 1977), with a tendency to lodge (Bugg, personal observation).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>This is an aggressive, early-maturing, cool-season annual grass that attains a height of from 20-60 cm.  Sheaths and blades are smooth with narrow panicles, 7-20 cm.  long.  Spikelets are 4-5 flowered, 10-30 mm. long; glumes smooth, unequal, about 3-10 mm. long; lemmas 4-6 mm. long, scabrous and ciliate on upper half; awns are scabrous, 10-20 mm. long (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Seedlings of 'Zorro' rattail fescue have excellent vigor (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>This grass establishes better on shallow, poor, and droughty soils than does `Blando` brome (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Flowering occurs from April through June for <I>Festuca megalura</I></B> and from March through May for <I>F.  myuros</I></B>.  This grass is earlier maturing than most grasses which helps ensure annual regeneration of stands (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Rattail fescue was probably introduced inadvertently into California during the Mission period (SCS, 1977).  Cv 'Zorro' was cooperatively released by the Soil Conservation Service and the California Agricultural Experiment Station in 1977 with commercial seed made available in 1978 (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>This is a drought-tolerant grass that will persist given a minimum annual precipitation of 25 cm.  (10 in.), or in areas receiving extra run-off or some supplemental irrigation.  (SCS, 1977.)<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>'Zorro' fescue has excellent application in erosion control because of its fibrous root system that provides soil stabilization on disturbed areas.  It will provide initial erosion control and as soil fertility improves will allow later-successional species to invade (SCS, 1977).<P> It is a self-reseeding grass suitable for orchard and vineyard floors (Miller et al., 1989).  It is a good cover crop in almonds where its short stature is an asset because it necessitates few mowings.  It increases water penetration in problem soils and is self-perpetuating.  In comparison trials, it took more abuse than `Blando` brome and produced less residue (SCS, 1977).<P> In spring, it provides food, nesting site, and cover for wildlife (SCS, 1977).<P> Foxtail fescue and rattail fescue have little value as forage (Fischer et al., 1978). SO Fischer, B.B., A.H.  Lange, J. McCaskill,B.  Crampton, and B. Tabraham.  1978.  Growers' Weed Identification Handbook. Division of Agricultural Sciences, University of California. Priced Publication 4030. Leaflet WI-101.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Foxtail fescue is naturalized from British Columbia to Baja California and is common in the Coast Ranges of California east to Montana and Arizona (Hitchcock, 1971).  Rattail fescue, introduced from Europe, is found on open ground on the coastal plain from Massachusetts to Texas; also found in Ohio, Wisconsin, Arizona, Mexico, and South America.  On the Pacific Coast, it ranges from Washington to southern California (Hitchcock, 1971). In California, it has persisted on sites up to 1365 m.  (4500 ft.) (SCS, 1977). SO Hitchcock, A.S.  1971.  Manual of the Grasses of the United States. Second edition revised by Agnes Chase 2 Volumes. Originally published in 1950 as U.S.D.A.  Miscellaneous Publication No.  200. Dover, New York.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>This grass tolerates highly-acidic sedimentary soils and mine spoils (pH 4.5) (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Timing of mowing is critical in maintaining stands of foxtail fescue.  It can be mowed frequently until seed development has been initiated, but it should not be cut thereafter until full maturation has occurred (SCS, 1977). Otherwise, plants will be killed without seed having been produced to ensure stand regeneration.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Optimum time for seeding is between October 1 and November 15 (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>This grass will grow on infertile sites.  Applying about 40 lbs of nitrogen per acre during seeding (October-November) will promote growth and quick cover.  This rate of application can be repeated during alternate years to maintain healthy self-reseeding, erosion-resistant stands (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>For seeding of critical or wildlife areas, this species can be broadcast at 12 lbs/acre or hydroseeded at 6 lbs/acre.  For use as a cover crop, it should be broadcast at 10 lbs/acre, or drilled at 6 lbs/acre (SCS, 1977).  <SAREP_PUBID=4078>Miller et al.  (1989)</A> recommend that as a cover crop it be seeded at 10 to 15 lbs/acre.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seed can be drilled or broadcast, but because of seed shape and size, the grains tend to stick together.  Rice hulls or a good agitator in drills will prevent "bridging over" and insure proper spacing of seed.  Good seedling and early growth make 'Zorro' an excellent choice for obtaining prompt initial erosion control cover with minimal seedbed preparation.  Loosening the soil surface before seeding and covering lightly produces the best stands.  In hydroseeding, seed, fertilizer, and mulch-fiber can be applied in one operation.  Best establishment occurs, however, when the seed is in contact with soil.  On steep, erodible slopes, 2 tons of straw per acre, applied and anchored following seeding and fertilizing operations, facilitates establishment.  Hydromulching could be used, but provides less protection from erosion (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>On the average, there are about 993,700 seeds/lb.  (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Foxtail fescue is an early colonizer of disturbed and infertile sites.  If sites improve, this species will be supplanted by taller and later-successional plants.  Mowing or grazing can be used to maintain foxtail fescue stands against such species.  (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>This grass is readily controlled by several herbicides, which can be used to prevent its becoming a troublesome weed (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>'Zorro' annual fescue has been variously considered a form of foxtail fescue, <I>Festuca megalura</I></B> Nutt.  <SAREP_PUBID=4658>(Miller et al., 1989)</A>, of rattail fescue, <I>Festuca myuros</I></B> L.  (formerly <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B>) (Slayback, pers. comm.), or <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> (L.) var.  <I>hirsuta</I></B> Hackel (Plant Materials: Grow Vulpia).  Slayback (pers. comm.) says that some consider <I>Vulpia</I></B> a synonym for <I>Festuca</I></B>, but that others maintain that the former term denotes annual species whereas the latter should be reserved for perennial forms.  According to an S.C.S. in-house technical note (Plant Materials: Grow Vulpia), <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> now comprises two varieties, one of which, <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> var.  <I>myuros</I></B>, subsumes <I>Festuca megalura</I></B> as a synonym.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Foxtail fescue is included among several annual <I>Festuca</I></B> spp.  that volunteer in various parts of California <SAREP_PUBID=4659>(Munz, 1973)</A>.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>In a replicated study (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991, cv 'Zorro' attained a height of 60.33+/-12.59 (cm, Mean +/- S.E.M.). (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>In a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990, and biomass harvest was on May 15-16, 1991.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherdspurse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  Based on visual estimation, 'Zorro' fescue provided vegetational cover of 93.75+/-3.75 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.).  Total winter weed biomass in plots with 'Zorro' was 0.791+/-0.444 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which was only 16% as much weed biomass as that observed in control plots (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>In a replicated trial (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991 total above-ground biomass (dry, cover crop + weeds) was measured as 8.284+/-0.958 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data)<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>'Zorro' fescue is viable in California to an altitude of 4,500 ft (1,365 m) and should be sown between October 1 and November 15 (SCS, 1977), suggesting moderate cold tolerance.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>'Zorro' fescue is suitable as a cover crop in almond orchards (SCS, 1977), suggesting some shade tolerance.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>We found no information on salinity tolerance of 'Zorro' fescue.<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>This is an aggressive, early-maturing, cool-season annual grass (SCS, 1977). Sowing of cv 'Zorro' should be between October 1 and November 15 (SCS, 1977). Flowering of <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> occurs from March through May <SAREP_PUBID=4659>(Munz, 1973)<A>, with maturation occurring from April through May (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' should be sown at a depth of 0.5-1.0 inch (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>This is a grass and requires no inoculation (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed is relatively inexpensive (Bugg, pers. comm.).   'Zorro' Fescue is $7.50 per lb (Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed is readily available from companies dealing in cover crop seed.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD><I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> flowers from March through May <SAREP_PUBID=4659>(Munz, 1973)</A>, suggesting a four- to five- month elapsed time between seeding and flowering (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>No information was available on seed production of cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>No information was available on seed storage of cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' has "an excellent fibrous root system" (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD><I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> tolerates shallow, infertile soils, and requires an annual precipitation of at least 25 cm.  Best establishment occurs with good seed-soil contact, but hydroseeding with seed, fertilizer, and mulch can lead to establishment (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD><I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> is usually managed without tillage, so incorporation is not an issue (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>No information was available on harvesting cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>No information was available on harvesting cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' is sometimes used in mixtures with annual clovers, such as crimson, rose, and subterranean clovers, in orchards (Bugg, pers. comm.). John H. Anderson (pers. comm.) believes that <I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> competes excessively with first-year native perennial grasses, at least on infertile red gravel soils.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>This grass does not fix nitrogen, and no information was available on the N content of cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>No information was available on the non-N nutrient contribution of cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' leads to improved permeability of orchard soils (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information was available on the the microclimatic effects of of cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' can be used to stabilize erodible sites and leads to improved permeability of orchard soils (SCS, 1977).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' is apparently of little value as a forage plant (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' produces little residue (SCS, 1977) and probably interferes little with orchard or vineyard workers (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Cv 'Zorro' apparently harbors few beneficial insects of interest to agriculture (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>No information was available on the nematodes associated with cv 'Zorro.' Given its winter growth period and early maturation, nematodes are probably not much of an issue under normal cultural practices (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>No information was available on the pathogens associated with cv 'Zorro.'<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>According to the SCS (1977), cv 'Zorro' provides early green growth that is of some value for wildlife food, nesting, and cover in the spring.<P>

<H1>More Drought Information<BR>
</H1>
<P>
More information about the drought for farmers, ranchers, consumers
and consultants is available.  Specifically:<BR>
<P>
A UC committee headed by Extension specialist Richard Snyder (UC
Davis Department of Land, Air, and Water Resources) is updating
tip sheets from the 1977 drought (and organized a series of grower
meetings in March.)<BR>
<P>
Many other meetings scheduled for the spring will include presentations
by farm advisors and irrigation specialists on drought-related
topics.  Contact your local Cooperative Extension office for specific
topics, dates.<BR>
<P>
The March-April issue of <I>California Agriculture </I>includes
several reports on research in irrigation techniques.<BR>
<P>
Several new publications are being developed to assist growers
in management of limited water resources.  ANR Publications (University
of California, 6701 San Pablo Ave., Oakland, CA 94608-1239; 415-642-2431)
is working with authors to complete publications on vineyard and
turf management in sufficient time to be useful this growing season.
<BR>
<P>
ANR Publications has reviewed more than 60 titles that relate
to water use and irrigation listed in the 1990 publications catalog.
 A short list will be distributed to the public.  Also see <B>Sustainable
Agriculture News</B> 2(4):9 (Summer 1990) for an annotated list
of ANR water conservation publications.<BR>
<P>
The Teletip automated phone information system, available in 30
out of California's 57 counties, has more than a dozen water messages
readily accessible by the public.  To find out your local Teletip
phone number, call your local Cooperative Extension office.<BR>
<P>
Additional information and answers to specific questions can be

<H1>SAREP Offices Move</H1>

<P>
After years of being split into offices at two locations, SAREP
staff members will be together at the new UC Division of Agriculture
and Natural Resources (DANR) building on Hopkins Road in the far
west section of the UC Davis
<P>
campus.  We will be sharing the building with the UC Small Farm
Center, the Genetic Resources Conservation Program, and the offices
of the directors of DANR's North Region and the North Central
Region.  The move is scheduled to be completed by the time this
newsletter is mailed.
<P>
Please note that SAREP staff members formerly identified with
the Information Group now do not need that designation as part
of their address.  We're all together.  Those staff members who
were housed off-campus will have new, on campus telephone numbers.
 The program address and FAX number and all telephone numbers
and e-mail addresses are listed below.  We expect the move to
go smoothly, however, there may be some telephone confusion in
the first several weeks.  Please call the main program telephone
number if there are problems with other lines, especially the
new &quot; 754-&quot; numbers.  We appreciate your patience, and
are looking forward to serving you more efficiently at our new
site!

<H1>Scavenging Nitrogen in Orchards<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP and Rick Miller; Agronomy and Range
Science Department, UC Davis<BR>
</I>
<P>
Nitrate levels in many wells throughout California exceed established
health standards, largely due to percolation of highly contaminated
water from agricultural soils. Soil water beneath fertilized orchards,
for example, can exceed 100 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of nitrate-nitrogen,
while health levels in drinking water have been set at 10 mg/l.
Nitrate leaching may be especially serious in tree crops, since
the proportion of nitrogen removed in the harvested crop to the
fertilizer applied is often far less with tree crops than in other
crops. Many practices aimed at improving nitrogen-use efficiency
have been developed, although many gaps in information still exist.
Overfertilization in tree crops is still common because most growers
rely on synthetic fertilizers.<BR>

<P>
One strategy that will reduce nitrate leaching is the use of winter
annual cover crops. These covers grow during the period when uptake
of nitrogen by trees is at a minimum and percolation from rainfall
is greatest. While few growers have economic or legal incentives
to grow cover crops solely to prevent nitrate leaching, it is
one of many benefits of cover cropping and should be an integral
part of orchard floor management decisions.<BR>

<H3>Timely Growth<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The amount of nitrogen taken up by the cover crop is closely related
to the biomass production of the cover crop. Cover crops must
grow vigorously in the fall and winter to be most effective. In
some orchards, this requirement maybe difficult to meet. For example,
drip irrigated orchards are usually dependent on fall rain for
cover crop germination, but rain often does not occur until November.<I>
</I>Also<I>, </I>late harvesting in walnut orchards can delay
cover crop planting until November.<BR>

<H3>Effects of Cover Crop Species<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<B>Resident Vegetation. </B>Using resident vegetation, or weeds,
can be an inexpensive and simple way to capture soil nitrate.
However, the amount of nitrate taken up by weeds varies greatly
among species. Since weed species composition among orchards varies
greatly, resident vegetation will vary in its nitrate uptake capacity.
Chemical mowing in the aisles often results in a weed population
with little biomass and therefore a negligible effect on nitrogen
cycling.<BR>

<P>
<B>Nonlegumes </B>Nonlegume cover crops will often accumulate
about 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre. However, they have been
shown to accumulate up to 100 to 150 pounds. Most of the research
on nitrate scavenging in nonlegumes has focused on a few key species.
Of the grasses, cereal rye has received the most attention, although
others have been successfully used, such as barley, annual ryegrass,
oats, and wheat. The crucifers showing the greatest potential
include oilseed radish, mustard, rape, and turnip. Another cover
crop species which has shown promise in lettuce rotations is phacelia,
also called bee phacelia.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes</B>. Legumes will use symbiotic nitrogen fixation to
obtain nitrogen, but only when soil nitrate levels are low. While
legumes usually recover less nitrate than nonlegumes, one study
showed that vetch acquired 125 pounds of nitrogen per acre from
a high-nitrogen soil. The remainder of the nitrogen in the vetch-about
70 pounds-was derived from nitrogen fixation. Mixing grasses and
legumes is a practical strategy for both conserving and adding
nitrogen.<BR>

<H3>Effects on Tree Nutrition</H3>

<P>
While cover crops can greatly affect nitrate leaching, it is also
important to consider their effects on tree nutrition. The carbon-to-nitrogen
ratio (C/N ratio) of residues is an indicator of subsequent nutrient
availability. With the incorporation into the soil of a high C/N
ratio material (e.g., grass residue), microorganisms will scavenge
available nitrogen from the soil, creating a temporary deficiency
for the trees. If a low C/N ratio material is incorporated into
moist soil, it will decompose rapidly and will release a large
flush of available nitrogen in the soil within a few weeks. The
time of incorporation (spring) corresponds to the time of high
demand by tree crops. The C/N ratios of some residues are as follows:
<BR>
<BR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=151>Grass</TD><TD WIDTH=114>40:1 to 80:1</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Under nontillage, residues with a high C/N ratio will decompose
slowly due to a lack of nitrogen source for microorganisms which
decompose surface mulch. The nitrogen contained in the residue
will become available to plants only after the residue has become
incorporated into the soil organic matter pool. If low C/N residue
is left on the surface, microbial decomposition will be more rapid
because of the favorable nutrient status. About 80 to 85 percent
of the nitrogen in cover crops is contained in the above-ground
portion.<BR>

<H3><B>Limitations on Effectiveness<BR>
</B></H3>

<P>
Several obstacles can limit cover crop production and nitrate
scavenging in orchards. These limitations usually do not preclude
the ability to grow cover crops. However, they can reduce their
ability to scavenge nitrate.<BR>

<P>
<B>Herbicide strips. </B>The ability of cover crops to remove
nitrate is reduced by the use of herbicide strips. For example,
an orchard with rows 24 feet apart and with a 6-foot herbicide
strip has only 75 percent of the soil planted to cover crops.
In addition, some growers fertilize in the treated strips only,
since this area contains a large portion of the tree roots. During
the winter, fertilizer nitrogen remaining in the strips may easily
leach beyond the tree root zone, especially if late summer or
fall applications were made.<BR>

<P>
<B>Shading. </B>Deciduous orchards with a complete canopy cover
can cast considerable shade on the orchard floor in the fall and
spring. Shading from the branch structure of deciduous trees probably
has minimal effect on cover crop growth during the winter. Cover
crops grown in citrus orchards, however, may receive little or
no direct sunlight, especially in orchards with east-west row
orientation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Winter orchard operations. </B>Cover crops in orchards can
rarely be left undisturbed during the winter. The traffic required
for pruning and spraying can seriously diminish the growth capacity
of the cover. Most species can tolerate a moderate amount of traffic,
however, especially when they are older. One operation that can
nearly eliminate most cover crops is pushing brush out of the
orchard. This practice should be done before planting or seedling
emergence. Cover crops could also be planted in alternate rows,
with brush stacked on rows with resident vegetation. Alternatively,
large wood can be removed and smaller wood can be shredded with
equipment now on the market.<BR>

<P>
Cover crops offer an important way to conserve excess soil nitrate
during winter and to supply nitrogen when needed by the trees
in the spring. Because of these and other benefits, orchardists
should consider using cover crops rather than relying solely on
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for managing nitrogen. Cover cropping
can then become a tool for integrated floor and fertility management.

Compiled by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> SAREP
<H3>Congressional Working Group on Sustainable Ag Formed</H3>

<P>
<B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>,</B> SAREP acting director and <B>Alice Jones</B>,
national director of USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education program, recently presented information on the Sustainable
Agriculture Network (SAN) and results of the first National Organic
Farmers Survey to the newly formed Congressional Working Group
on Sustainable Agriculture. Rep<B>. Sam Farr</B> (D-CA), a member
of the House Committee on Agriculture, has been instrumental in
establishing the new congressional working group, which will provide
Members of Congress with information on: the National Organic
Standards Board, the USDA sustainable agriculture program, research
and education programs at leading academic institutions, administrative
and legislative initiatives that would remove barriers and foster
the growth of sustainable agriculture, and the objectives of sustainable
agriculture and the organic food industry in the 1995 farm bill.
Additional members of the congressional working group are representatives
<B>George Brown, Gary Condit</B>, and <B>Calvin Dooley</B> (all
from CA), <B>Charlie Rose</B> (NC), <B>Peter DeFazio</B> (OR),

<H3>Organic Farmers Name Top Three Research Priorities</H3>

<P>
The first-ever national survey of certified organic farmers found
that the top three research priorities of growers are to identify
ways to increase consumer demand for organic products, to study
the relationship of growing practices to crop quality and nutrition,
and to study the relationship between plant nutrition and pest
resistance. The mail survey, conducted by the Organic Farming
Research Foundation (OFRF), was completed by 550 of the 2,700
growers who received it. Nearly one-third of those responding
had participated in on-farm research projects, and more than 80
percent said they would be interested in doing so if resources
were available. For more information, contact OFRF, P.O. Box 440.

<H3>GAO Asked to Investigate FDA Handling of BGH</H3>

<P>
Representatives <B>David Obey</B> (D-WI), <B>George Brown</B>
(D-CA), and <B>Bernie Sanders</B> (I-VT) have asked the U.S. General
Accounting Office (GAO) to investigate allegations that three
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employees may have violated
federal conflict-of-interest regulations during the agency's handling
of the approval process for bovine growth hormone (BGH). All three
employees had ties to Monsanto, the maker of Posilac, the first
recombinant bovine growth hormone product to hit the market. FDA
officials said that they have reviewed the conflict-of-interest
allegations and found them to be without basis. The letter from
the three representatives to the GAO counters by stating &quot;There
is strong evidence that all three of these employees may have
violated at least two ethical regulations applicable to them pursuant
to the Code of Federal Regulations.&quot; For more information
see &quot;rBGH News of the Week,&quot; <I>Food Safety Week</I>,
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, April 26, 1994. <BR>

<H3>Federal Farm Worker Safety Regulations Delayed</H3>

<P>
Under pressure from farm groups, Congress passed legislation in
March that delayed implementation of new rules designed to prevent
thousands of pesticide poisonings each year. The rules, which
have been under consideration since 1984 and were to take effect
April 15,1994, will now be dormant until January. According to
the EPA, pesticides acutely poison between 10,000 and 20,000 farm
workers annually. The agency believes the new rules can prevent
up to 80 percent of those poisonings. In California, 615 cases
of pesticide poisoning related to agriculture were reported in
1990, and analysts believe that up to 80 percent of those poisonings
go unreported. See<B> Michael</B> <B>Doyle</B>, &quot;Pesticide
protection rules delayed,&quot; <I>Sacramento Bee</I>, March 23,
1994. <BR>

<H3>California State Policy Issues</H3>

<P>
Two bills seeking reduction of chemical use in agriculture have
been introduced in the California legislature. Assembly member
Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert) carried AB 3383, sponsored by
the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF), which would
provide farmers with incentives and field support to adopt more
ecological farming practices. The legislation would enable an
expansion of the already successful Biologically Integrated Orchard
Systems (BIOS) program underway in Merced County. Another bill,
SB 475 carried by Sen. <B>Nicholas Petris</B> (D-Oakland), would
require California to significantly reduce pesticide use, phase
out the most hazardous pesticides, and increase support for farmers
to learn safer pest management practices. For information about
AB 3383, contact <B>Reggie Knox,</B> CAFF, (408) 425-8145. For

<H1>Free Farm Safety Program<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A <I>Farm Safety Program </I>designed by agricultural engineering
extension at UC Davis is available for public use. Established
to promote safety in the agricultural workplace, the project has
a no-charge library of safety videos, films and other training
materials for farmers or others wanting to develop safety programs
for themselves or their employees. Safety in agriculture includes
avoiding short-term injuries and illness, as well as the effects
of long-term exposure to farm hazards. <B>William Steinke</B>
is the director of the program and can be reached at (916)752-1613.
The phone number for the video library is (916) 752-0563<I>.<BR>

UC SAREP is required by the California Legislature's 1986 Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Act to have both public and
technical advisory committees to advise the university on program
goals and to make recommendations on the award of competitive
grants.  The Public Advisory Committee (PAC) includes approximately
15 individuals actively involved in agricultural production, as
well as representatives from government, public organizations,
and institutions of higher education.  The Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC), made up of approximately 15 university wide faculty
and staff with knowledge and experience related to sustainable
agriculture, makes recommendations about the scientific merit
of grant applications and advises the program.  Each PAC or TAC
member serves for three years.  In 1991, SAREP added 10 new members
to its advisory committees.  The following is a complete list
of PAC and TAC members.  New members are marked with an *<BR>

The state of the State is not good.  The projected budget deficit
appears to be in the area of $12 to $13 billion.  Ultimately,
some combination of tax increases and budget cuts will probably
work its way down through most public agencies, including the
University.  There is a real cost/price squeeze in the UC's Division
of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR).  In many cases, more
is being asked of the university community, while resources to
do the work are being reduced.  If the mission of the DANR is
to provide the research and education necessary to help manage
the State's landscape in a fashion that is sustainable, then new
ways of gathering information or research may be needed.<BR>
<H3>On-Farm Answers?</H3>
<P>
The answers to many problems facing agriculture are actually on
many of California's farms.  We need a methodology that is acceptable
to both the scientific and farming community that will help speed
the collection and analysis of on-farm information.  If we had
such a method, then on-farm research and practical experience
would become a real asset used by the University community and
others.  This observational, intuitive, and scientific information
is available if we are willing to develop the tools and use an
open mind in evaluating it.  The development and use of this information
presents the scientific community with a major resource.<BR>
<H3>Farm Statistics</H3>
<P>
In this issue SAREP information Systems manager <B>Jill Auburn</B>
presents information on a relatively new approach to appropriate
statistics for on-farm information (see page 5).  The UC Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Program will attempt to help
develop this information so we can rapidly address many of the
critical resource and production issues that California farmers
face.  We see this as a way to move agriculture's agenda forward
in a way that is compatible with both good science and good farming.

<H1>USDA Funds Sustainable Agriculture Network</H1>
<P>
SAREP Information Systems Manager <B>Jill Auburn</B> is the chair
of a new Sustainable Agriculture Network being planned by representatives
from 14 universities, government, business and non-profit organizations.
 The network has received a grant for $90,000 from the USDA's
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program (formerly
known as the Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture or LISA program).
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The idea for the network is to share information about sustainable
agriculture among many information users and providers, &quot;Auburn
said. Information related to sustainable agriculture is increasingly
available from an informal network of research and education institutions,
private non-profits, farmer organizations and other groups, she
said.  &quot;However, locating the information and identifying
the gaps is an increasing challenge.&quot;<BR>
<P>
A &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; format directory of individuals and
organizations in sustainable agriculture is one of the first goals
of the network, and should make it easier for those interested
in sustainable agriculture topics to find what they need, Auburn
said.  The network is also sponsoring a showcase of sustainable
agriculture information at an international sustainable agriculture
symposium at the Ohio State University November 10-13.  (See <B>Calendar</B>,
back page).<BR>
<P>
The network committee was formed last year to develop a plan and
send recommendations to the national Sustainable Agriculture program
for information development and dissemination.  The following
recommendations were presented at a meeting in Washington, DC
last December:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The collection, evaluation, synthesis and dissemination of
information should be a high priority of the national Sustainable
Agriculture program, including computerized networking of electronic
information as well as better organization and access to information
in more traditional forms.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The network should be a decentralized system in which databases,
documents, and decision aids are developed and maintained locally,
but shared in printed and electronic form among a wide variety
of institutions and individuals.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Materials developed by the national Sustainable Agriculture
program should complement rather than duplicate those available
from other sources.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The electronic network should conform as much as possible
to the standards being adopted by USDA nationally, such as the
use of the existing Internet/NSFNET computer network, as long
as that system is accessible by nongovernmental institutions and
individuals.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The regional Administrative Councils (who solicit and recommend
grants for the national Sustainable Agriculture program) should
specifically request and fund projects that identify, collate,
synthesize and disseminate information.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A minimum amount of central coordination should be supported
at the national level, for establishing standard formats, maintaining
an index to the information available in the network, and other
activities that should be centralized.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Special attention should be given to &quot;experiential&quot;
information: information that comes from careful observation,
case studies, and other non-experimental sources.  In doing so,
issues of credibility and reliability must be addressed.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The new funding will be used by the committee to begin implementing
the parts of the plan that are best accomplished centrally, Auburn
said.  In addition to developing the directory mentioned previously
(in database and printed form), the activities include developing
a &quot;taxonomy&quot; or organizational scheme for classifying
sustainable agriculture information, and a thesaurus of terms
used to identify sustainable agriculture materials; identifying
examples of documents and other products that are exemplary in
providing well-integrated information on high-priority topics
(an end-product of the November showcase noted previously); adopting
a standardized format for electronic exchange of documents; and
developing a plan for including more and better experiential information
in sustainable agriculture and databases.<BR>
<P>
Much of this planning will take place over several years, Auburn
said.  &quot;The two most visible products in the first year will
be the showcase of information and the directory,&quot; she said.
<BR>
<P>
The showcase was the idea of committee member <B>John Ikerd</B>,
extension economist at the University of Missouri, as a way to
identify exemplary educational materials in a forum that would
also get the information to end users (conference participants)
immediately.  If the showcase is successful, it may be repeated
at other meetings, Auburn said.<BR>
<P>
The directory is being compiled by the staff of Appropriate Technology
Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA) under the direction of <B>Jim
Lukens</B>, ATTRA program manager.  Rather than an exhaustive
compilation, it will contain entries representative of the broad
range of types of people and organizations involved in sustainable
agriculture.  The first version will be available by September
1992, in both electronic (database) form and a printed version
published by Rodale Press.  Rodale has been chosen as the national
Sustainable Agriculture program's central publisher for these
and other documents, including a forthcoming handbook on cover
crops. <B>Mike Brusko</B>, publisher of the Rodale Institute's
The New Farm magazine, serves on the information network committee.
 Reports of the committee's progress will appear in future editions
of Sustainable Agriculture News.<BR>
<P>
<B>Note:</B> Individuals who have expertise or interest in particular
areas of the committee's work (such as experiential information,
or electronic document preparation) are welcome to correspond
with Auburn.  While the 14 committee members span a broad range
of institutions and expertise, the network will function best
if it has creative input from a wide array of potential contributors
and users of sustainable agriculture information, she said.  Correspondence
can be by electronic mail (see box), by mail (Jill Auburn, Information
Group -UC SAREP University of California, Davis, CA 95616), or
by telephone (916) 757-3278<BR>

<H1>Sources of Funding</H1>
<H3>UC SAREP Grants for Economics, Public Policy</H3>
<P>
UC SAREP will offer a Request for Proposals in 1991-92 devoted
to social, economic, and public policy analysis of food and agricultural
systems.  We are seeking proposals that address the relationship
between the transition underway in farming practices and the political,
economic, and social dynamics of the broader food system.  Proposals
will examine public policies, economic arrangements, and the social
institutions to determine in what ways they are, or are not, compatible
with the goals of sustainable agriculture, and how necessary changes
might be implemented.  They would also consider how the choice
of production practices influences the character and viability
of rural communities, the conditions of labor, human health and
nutrition, and the quality of democratic decision-making processes.
<BR>
<P>
We expect to release RFP in mid-July, with proposals due by October
1, 1991.  (If you receive <B>Sustainable Agriculture News</B>,
the RFP will be mailed to you.)  Grants will be awarded on December
1, 1991.  Total funding for this RFP will be approximately $50,000,
with no single award to exceed $25,000.  Multi-year projects will
be accepted, although funding beyond the first-year is subject
not only to evidence of progress but funding availability.  For
more information, write UC SAREP, University of California, Davis,
CA 95616, or call (916) 752-7556.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>$1000 Organic Farming Article Award</H3>
<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation announces the availability
of a $1,000 award for the best article published in 1991 aimed
at educating the general public about organic farming .  Articles
must be published between January 1, 1991 and December 1, 1991

G. Stuart Pettygrove
<P>
Article written for Sustainable Agriculture/Technical Reviews.
1994<BR>
<BR>

<P>
In a 15-acre field experiment started in 1988 at Sills Farms in
Sutter County, we have shown that winter cover cropping in a continuous,
high-yielding rice rotation provides a significant benefit (table
1). Improvements in rice yields with the cover crop were found
with less-than-ideal conditions (acid soil pH 4.5, poor drainage,
presence of unchopped rice straw) and occurred across the three
different residue management systems: fall disced, fall burned,
and spring disced. <BR>

<P>
Conventional practices have been used on this field and rice has
been planted each year. The system is, therefore, quite different
from the typical organic rice system in which one crop of rice
is followed by one or more years out of rice with cover cropping.
The production of the cover crop has not required any special
equipment or inputs other than the seed for the cover crop. <BR>

<P>
During three years (1990-1992), cover cropping with purple vetch
reduced the nitrogen requirement of the rice by 60 to 105 pounds
per acre. These figures were determined by fertilizer nitrogen
rate plots established each year in the experiment's main plots.
This reduction in the amount of fertilizer needed represents a
savings of between 2 and 3.5 million BTUs of energy per acre annually
(equivalent to 1425 gallons diesel fuel per acre). The resultant
energy savings outweighs the small amount of energy required to
produce and harvest the cover crop seed and broadcast it in a
rice field. <BR>

<P>
The profitability of green manuring is also being assessed. Calculating
the difference in net income between the green manure and non-green
manure rotation depends on a number of factors including the cost
of vetch seed and the seeding rate. If the grower produces his
or her own vetch seed, the land charge or opportunity cost must
also be factored in. In our calculations, we have assumed that:
1) purple vetch seed was produced by the grower at a cost of 10
cents per pound including land charges; 2) vetch was planted as
a green manure crop at 50 pounds per acre; 3) rice was fertilized
each year in all plots at the optimal nitrogen rates determined
in the fertilizer sub-plots. With these assumptions, the cost
of green manuring comes to $18 per acre. <BR>

<P>
The fertilizer value of the nitrogen contained in the vetch ranged
from $4 to $22 per acre (1990-1992). In 1993, wet winter conditions
resulted in extremely poor vetch growth, so little nitrogen value
was realized. In reality, a farmer would respond to this poor
growth by fertilizing rice at an appropriate rate. <BR>

<P>
In all three straw management systems, we have observed a slightly
better maximum yield on the vetch plots than on non-vetch plots
(table 1). This effect is not related to nitrogen levels since,
even at the highest nitrogen rates, grain yield on non-cover cropped
plots did not reach maximum yields on the cover cropped plots.
We have not so far observed any obvious effects of green manuring
on rice diseases or on rice straw decomposition, and cannot otherwise
explain the higher yields on the vetch plots. When these higher
yields are combined with the nitrogen fertilizer effects, the
overall net gain (of green manuring compared to winter fallow)
in four years is $6 per acre on the fall disced system, $47 for
the spring disced system and $104 for the burned system. <BR>

<P>
This research was funded through grants from the Rice Research
Board, the California Energy Commission, and UC SAREP. Cooperating
investigators include Stuart Pettygrove and Kate Scow (UCD Land,
Air and Water Resources), Jack Williams (UC Cooperative Extension,
Sutter-Yuba) and Jim Hill (UCD Agronomy and Range Science). <BR>

<H1>500 Attend Low-Input Grape Meetings<BR>
</H1>
<P>
The success of a December 1988 reduced input grape meeting in
Visalia prompted the presentation of three similar meetings in
the fall of 1989. Each program was sponsored in part by UC Cooperative
Extension and the UC SAREP.  The October 24 meeting at Kearney
Agricultural Center in Parlier, moderated by <B>Bob Sheesley</B>,
Fresno County Cooperative Extension director, was attended by
approximately 250 people. The meeting in Stockton on November
7, co-sponsored by the UC Statewide IPM Project and the Lodi District
Grape Growers, was led by Stanislaus County Farm Advisor <B>Kathy
Kelley</B> and drew about 90 people. The November 14 Santa Rosa
meeting was co-sponsored by University Extension and moderated
by <B>Jim Wolpert</B>, viticulture extension specialist at UC
Davis and was attended by 190 people.<BR>
<H3>New Vineyard Considerations</H3>
<P>
Most of the presentations addressed practices which can reduce
chemical inputs in <I>existing </I>vineyards. <B>Paul Verdegaal</B>,
San Joaquin County viticulture advisor, and Jim Wolpert, however,
discussed the importance of site and variety considerations in
the <I>initial establishment </I>of a vineyard, and how their
careful consideration can lead to reduced inputs later. Verdegaal
spoke at the Stockton meeting, while Wolpert spoke at the Santa
Rosa meeting.  They identified three site characteristics which
influence pest management strategies: soil type and depth, previous
crop history, and location. Grape variety choices will in most
cases be determined by overall market demand and/or buyer needs.
When a choice exists, however, the use of certain varieties can
mitigate potential insect, disease and nutritional problems, they
said.<BR>
<H3>Nutrition, Vine Management</H3>
<P>
&quot;The key to vine management is to adequately fill the trellis
system without creating excessive vigor,&quot; said <B>Pete Christensen</B>,
extension viticulture specialist, at the Kearney and Stockton
meetings. Christensen said the rate of nitrogen (N) applied should
be adjusted to account for potential vigor. He noted that recent
research has shown maximum N uptake is during late spring or summer,
rather than in winter or early spring. Postharvest applications
have been shown to provide high levels of stored N at dormancy,
supplying the N needs of early spring growth. Split fertilizations
at these times have resulted in nearly a 50%<I> </I>decrease in
N applied per acre in the southern San Joaquin Valley due to the
increased efficiency of uptake, he said. Cover crops can be used
either to add N (legumes) when deficient, or to compete with vines
during the summer to control excessive vine vigor, according to
Christensen.  For maximum N availability, the legume should be
incorporated in the spring just before it blooms, he said. Excessive
vigor can be controlled by allowing a cover of Blando brome grass
to mature (mowing before the frost period) and reseed. This practice
will tie up N, delaying and extending its availability, he said.
The use of a summer grass cover will also help control vigor due
to increased competition for water and nutrients, and the cover
will also reduce dust problems, Christensen said.<BR>
<H3>Soil, Water Management</H3>
<P>
<B>Bill Liebhardt</B>, SAREP director, reviewed the pros and cons
of manures and composts at the Santa Rosa meeting. He discussed
the process of organic matter decomposition. While both manures
and composts improve soil tilth and add essential nutrients, nutrients
in compost are more concentrated and are biologically more stable,
he said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Terry Prichard</B>, water management extension specialist at
UC Davis, discussed his research at the Santa Rosa meeting. His
work in almonds showed that when a cover crop of Blando brome
grass is mowed in the spring, the clippings protect the soil surface,
impede moisture loss, and act as a mulch to prevent weed seed
germination.  A residual herbicide treatment also resulted in
low water use, but increased soil compaction, he said.<BR>
<P>
Non-chemical weed control was UC Davis Extension Weed Specialist
<B>Clyde Elmore's</B> topic at the Santa Rosa meeting.  He said
growers face two major weed management issues: <I>any </I>weeds
in the vine rows of young vineyards, and <I>perennial </I>weeds
in established vineyards. Elmore said various kinds of natural
and synthetic mulches look promising, although some are very expensive.
He said cover crops may out compete problem weeds with proper
management, noting that Elka ryegrass has been shown to suppress
96% of other weeds.<BR>
<H3>Grape IPM</H3>
<P>
<B>Bill Barnett</B>, area Integrated Pest Management (IPM) advisor
at Kearney, presented an overview of IPM principles in grape production
at the Kearney meeting. He stressed the importance of cultural
and biological control methods, but he said that chemical pesticides,
with all their drawbacks, will continue to be a tool in pest management.
He talked about the need to get off the &quot;pesticide treadmill&quot;
by timing their applications to minimize the effect on non-target
organisms, and by spot-treating problem areas which have been
identified through extensive monitoring.<BR>
<H3>Leaf Removal</H3>
<P>
At the Kearney and Stockton meetings, <B>Jim Stapleton</B>, area
IPM advisor in Stanislaus County, presented results from studies
on wine grapes which indicated that selective leaf removal vastly
reduces bunch rots, especially <I>Botrytis. </I>Stapleton recommended
evaluating the effects of leaf removal on a small portion of acreage
before using this technique on an entire vineyard. Mechanical
leaf removal on wine grapes may become more cost effective and
replace removal by hand, he said. <B>Jim Marois</B>, a plant pathology
associate professor at UC Davis, continued the discussion of leaf
removal at the Santa Rosa meeting. <I><FONT SIZE=2>Botrytis </FONT></I>stops
growing beyond a certain &quot;evaporation potential,&quot; and
wind speed is the factor which most affects evaporation of moisture
off grapes. The major effect of leaf removal is to keep grape
clusters and the air surrounding them drier, which stops the spread
of <I>Botrytis, </I>Marois noted. Cluster tightness is a more
important factor in disease incidence than is individual berry
susceptibility, he said. Further research may show that cluster
manipulation may help prevent bunch rots, he said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Kenneth Hagen</B>, a UC Berkeley entomology professor, spoke
about insect predators and explained how leaf removal for control
of bunch rots reduces the number of leaves which predators and
parasites have to cover in search of prey, increasing their effectiveness.
He said predators may play a strong role in vineyards, and should
be encouraged by pollen, nectar and habitats provided by cover
crops.<BR>
<H3>Leafhoppers</H3>
<P>
Leafhopper management was discussed at all three meetings. &quot;The
grape and variegated leafhoppers are the most important pests
of grapevines in the San Joaquin Valley,&quot; according to Tulare
County Farm Advisor <B>Bill Peacock</B>, who spoke at the Kearney
meeting. He said that vine vigor is essential to reduce leafhopper
populations. The parasitic wasp, <I>Anagrus epos, </I>is an effective
natural enemy of the grape leafhopper, but only about 30% control
of variegated leafhoppers can be expected, he said. Peacock emphasized
that it is important to avoid using chemical insecticides unless
absolutely necessary, due to mites' increased resistance to them,
and to the disruptive effect insecticides have on mite predators.
 This requires knowing both the economic level of leafhopper populations
and the amount of egg parasitism, especially during the first
brood, he said. Control of these first brood nymphs is important
and can be done using soaps or summer oils; leaf removal has also
been shown to be effective.<BR>
<P>
<B>Bill Barnett</B> discussed leafhopper management at the Stockton
and Santa Rosa meetings. He said vineyards in the Stockton/Lodi
area nearly always have <I>Anagrus </I>parasites due to the large
number of riparian areas containing blackberry vines. Blackberries,
as well as prunes and possibly almonds act as alternate hosts
of the parasite during the winter. The variegated leafhopper,
however, has recently moved into the northern San Joaquin Valley
and is moving toward northern coastal areas. New <I>Anagrus </I>parasites
from Mexico, Arizona and Colorado have been introduced into California
in an attempt to provide increased biological control. Barnett
also stressed that general predators, especially spiders, can
be important in leafhopper control, and that cover crops will
greatly increase the population of such predators.<BR>
<H3>Mites, Mealybugs</H3>
<P>
The management of mites, a pest which often flares up after insecticidal
applications for leafhoppers, was addressed at the Kearney meeting
by <B>Harry Andris</B>, Fresno  County  farm  advisor.    He 
said  cultural considerations that help reduce mite damage include
avoiding water stress to the vines, reducing dusty conditions,
and providing a habitat for mite predators. Summer cover crops
or a native weed cover provide such an habitat and are gaining
in popularity.<BR>
<P>
<B>Don Flaherty,</B> entomology farm advisor in Tulare County,
discussed mealybug management at the Kearney meeting.  Mealybugs
overwinter on old wood under loose bark and readily infest bunches
which later touch the cordons (woody part of grape plant). Some
growers are using arbors, allowing the clusters to hang free from
old wood. If spraying must be done, spot-spraying can minimize
damage to parasites, he noted.<BR>
<H3>Spray Oils</H3>
<P>
New approaches to pest control were addressed at the Kearney meeting
by <B>Jack Dibble</B>, entomology specialist at Kearney. He said
that narrow range spray oils that are effective against certain
insect and mite pests of tree and vine crops, are inexpensive
and very safe. Because the mode of action is through suffocation,
thorough spray coverage is important, he said. Soaps are also
quite safe and show effectiveness on mites and both species of
leafhoppers, Dibble said. Vacuum machines have recently received
attention and some growers have reported 40-50%<I> </I>control
of leafhoppers, he added.<BR>
<H3>Nematodes</H3>
<P>
<B>Mike McKenry</B>, extension nematologist at Kearney Agricultural
Center, talked about nematode management at the Stockton and Santa
Rosa meetings. He noted that many commercial nematicides may soon
become unavailable, and discussed alternatives including resistant
rootstocks, more frequent irrigation, manuring, cover crops, and
soil amendments. Each of these may have drawbacks and some are
expensive, he said. Many plant extracts are toxic to nematodes,
but have also been found to be toxic to plant roots, he said.
Finally, while some cover crops have been found to restrict vine
growth, McKenry said the following three winter covers seem to
be compatible with grapevines and do not harbor nematodes: Cahaba
white vetch, barley, and Blando brome grass.<BR>
<P>
The Stockton meeting also included a panel discussion with two
local growers.<B> John Tecklenburg</B>, from Lodi, became frustrated
with the excessive use of Furadan and the buildup of root knot
nematodes in his farming operation. He explained how implementing
IPM techniques helped him reduce mite buildup while improving
his general farm management practices. <B>Joe Cotta</B>, whose
family has been farming since 1966, noted that their operation
started without a spray rig.  He said they eventually joined most
growers on the &quot;pesticide treadmill.&quot; When problems
arose with the use of the pesticide Metasystox-R (MSR) on grapes,
they began to examine their farming techniques. They now successfully
farm a portion of their vineyard with no chemical sprays.<BR>

system's impact on nutrition, environment, energy consumption,
and local economic development.
<P><LI><B>Jered Lawson, </B>in cooperation with the Community Alliance
with Family Farmers, &quot;Sharing the Costs of Land Tenure and
Stewardship: A Profile of a Family and Community's Efforts to
Preserve their Agricultural Land and their Sustainable Farming
Practices&quot;: $5,000.  The project will create a manual describing
&quot;shared equity,&quot; an innovative model for maintaining
ag land in sustainable production.  In the model developed by
<B>Steve </B>and <B>Gloria Decater </B>at Live Power Community
Farm in Covelo, the farmer owns the productive agricultural value
of the land, and a non-profit organization owns the land's additional
speculative or market value.

&quot;A Comparison of Conventional, Low Input and Organic Farming
Systems: The Transition Phase and Long Term Viability&quot;: $12,253.
 <A HREF="http://pubweb.ucdavis.edu/documents/safs/home.htm">The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems Project</A> at UC Davis
is in its seventh year.  It is comparing four farming systems
with different levels of dependence on external resources over
a 12-year period.
<P><LI><B>Richard Smith, </B>San Benito County farm advisor, &quot;Nitrogen
Fertility Monitoring in Organic and Conventional Vegetable Systems&quot;:
$2,744.  In organic farming systems, &quot;quick tests&quot; for
nitrate in plant and soil analyses may not be a good indicator
of crop nitrogen status.  This study will evaluate quick tests
on two organic and two conventional onion farms.
<P><LI><B>Krishna Subbarao, </B>assistant plant pathologist, Cooperative
Extension Specialist, UC Davis, &quot;Subsurface Drip Irrigation
for Soilbome Disease Management in Lettuce&quot;: $11,000.  The
use of subsurface drip irrigation in vegetable production can
improve the efficiency of water use and reduce nitrate leaching.
 This project will evaluate the effects of subsurface drip and
furrow irrigations on lettuce diseases.
<P><LI><B>Ford Denison, </B>Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;Rotation Length and Organic Transitions&quot;:  $10,000.
 An additional four-year organic rotation will be added to the
SAREP funded 100-year long-term farmland research experiment at
UC Davis.  The project will evaluate two-year and four-year rotation
length and will assess the contributions of soil quality and human
factors in the transition to organic farming.

<P>
<I>Ponting, C.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Environment 32(9):4-9, 31-33.  1990<BR>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note:  This article is derived from the author's
book:  Ponting, C.  1991.  A Green History of the World.  Sinclair
Stevenson, Ltd.., London.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Solving today's environmental problems takes on a new sense of
urgency when considered in light of the decline of natural resources
of past eras.  Historical texts fail to acknowledge the direct
relationship which often existed between the rise and fall of
civilizations, and poor soil and water management.  This article
investigates that relationship and poses questions about the future
of our own civilization.  <BR>
<P>
Before the development of agriculture, people lived in small,
migratory groups.  This period was one of great ecological stability;
nearly all parts of the globe were inhabitable and people had
enough food and water to survive.  The development of agriculture
about 10,000 years ago enabled people to live in concentrated
population centers.  Expanding populations led to increased demand
for resources and ultimately to massive disruption of natural
ecosystems.  The article examines how three societies exploited
their natural resources, attempted to deal with their ecological
problems, and ultimately declined as a result of the deterioration
of the resource base.  <BR>
<P>
<B>Mesopotamia.</B> A classic example of an agricultural system
that was not sustainable is seen in the southern Mesopotamian
region (Sumer) during the third and second millennia B.C.  Because
of lack of rain during the growing season, water storage and irrigation
were necessary.  Rapid evaporation of water from soils, caused
by high temperatures, and high water tables led to the buildup
of salts on the soil surface.  Allowing the land to lie fallow
would have lowered water tables, however limited land availability
and rising population only increased the pressure to intensify
food production.<BR>
<P>
In about 3500 B.C., wheat and barley were grown in roughly equal
amounts.  Gradually less and less wheat could be grown due to
high salinity, and by 1700 B.C., only the salt-tolerant barley
could be grown throughout the entire region.  Crop yields also
drastically declined during this period and entire fields turned
white with salts and became unproductive.  The most interesting
feature noted about this time period involves the political history
of the region.  Military conquests of the region, outlined in
the article, closely followed the steady decline of the agriculture
base.  Ultimately, Mesopotamian society shifted permanently to
the north, while Sumer became underpopulated and impoverished.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Mediterranean Region.</B> Environmental degradation and
the shift in the plant species of the region occurred as a result
of &quot;relentless pressure of long-term human settlement and
growing population.&quot;  The natural vegetation of the Mediterranean
basin was a mixed evergreen and deciduous forest, but forests
have been cleared steadily for fuel and for use in agriculture
and construction.  For example,  about 90 percent of the original
forests along the eastern Mediterranean have been removed.  Of
notable stature and importance were the famed cedars of Lebanon,
of which only four  small groves remain. <BR>
<P>
All other areas of the Mediterranean have suffered a similar environmental
decline as well.  In Greece, over-grazing caused severe soil erosion,
mostly during the seventh century B.C.  This led to the widespread
planting of olives, which were the only tree that had roots strong
enough to penetrate the limestone rock underlying the badly eroded
land.  Rapid deforestation in Italy resulted in soil erosion so
severe that numerous ports in estuaries became silted up from
the eroded hillside soils.  The ecology of North African provinces
declined much more slowly, but intensified after the fall of Rome.
 Tribes brought in large flocks of grazing animals that denuded
the remaining vegetation and led to increasing desertification.
<BR>
<P>
<B>The Maya.</B> The Mayan civilization of Central America consisted
of large and complex population centers which date back to 2500
B.C.  Recent archaeological work indicates that some cities had
populations of 30,000 to 50,000, and the entire Mayan lowland
jungle may have had as many as 5 million people. Pyramids were
built in these cities between 600 and 800 A.D., after which population
levels fell abruptly, and the cities became covered by the encroaching
jungle.<BR>
<P>
Many historians formerly believed that the Mayans obtained their
food primarily by using swidden agriculture. Swidden agriculture
involves temporarily clearing and burning a patch of jungle, growing
maize and beans for a couple of years, and then abandoning the
plot for 20 or more years until the jungle grows back. This form
of agriculture was clearly incapable of supporting such a large
population.<BR>
<P>
Recent investigations have found an intensive agricultural system,
which included extensive terracing on highly erodible hillsides,
as well as raised fields constructed in swampy areas. Increasing
population likely pushed agriculture largely onto the most marginal
soils, and forests were cleared for crop production, fuel, and
construction. Eroded hillsides probably became unarable, and silt
carried by rivers would have seriously damaged the flatland raised
fields. The continuous warfare now known to have occurred among
Mayan peoples likely intensified because of reduced food production
and declining natural resources. The result was a rapid population
decline and a return to far less intensive methods of food production.
<BR>
<P>
The author concludes by posing two increasingly important questions:
&quot;Are contemporary societies any better than ancient ones
at controlling the drive toward ever greater use of resources
and heavier pressure on the environment? Is humanity too confident
about its ability to
<P>
avoid ecological disaster?&quot; Finally, &quot;Given the 2-million-year
history of humans on Earth, it is still an open question whether
the 10,000-year-old development of agriculture and settled societies
and the more recent dependence on nonrenewable fossil fuels constitute
an ecologically sustainable strategy.&quot;

<H3>California SAWG's First Statewide Meeting</H3>

<P>
Supported by funding from SAREP, the California Sustainable Agriculture
Working Group (SAWG) held its first statewide meeting on October
8-9 in Modesto.  The meeting brought together 67 individuals representing
a broad range of groups, including farmers, legislative and
<P>
agency staff, research and extension staff, non- profit representatives,
and grassroots activists for anti-hunger and labor concerns. 
Plenary sessions addressed sustainable agriculture in the 21st
cen- tury, the Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture and the 1995
Farm Bill, production and policy alternatives for reducing pesticide
use, and the links between sustainable agriculture and com- munity
food security.  Alliances were formed among the diverse participants,
and plans were made for SAWG activities.  The California SWAG,
one of five regional SAWGs around the nation, is designed as an
institutional vehicle for advancing the common interests of the
diverse constituencies involved in sustainable agriculture, For
more information, contact <B>Kai Siedenburg,</B> SAWG Project
Coordinator, P.O. Box 1599, Santa Cruz, CA 95061; (408) 458-5304.
<H3>Rise in Migrancy Among California Farmworkers</H3>

<P>
A recent Department of Labor report based on National Agricultural
Workers Survey finds that almost half (47 percent) of all California
agricultural workers migrate to find seasonal jobs.  The finding
is based on interviews completed  between January 1989 and June
1991. That figure is up from the 39 percent migrancy rate found
in a 1983 survey. The study found that most migrant workers travel
from their hometowns to a particular work site, then return when
the job is done.  These &quot;shuttle&quot; migrants outnumber
circular migrants-those who follow the crops from place to place
on a seasonal route-by almost three to one. Four out of five shuttle
migrants travel between a foreign country (mostly Mexico) and
the United States. The study suggests that most migrants seek
a lifestyle of stable long-term agricultural employment, but few
find it due to the structure of farm labor demand which emphasizes
temporary jobs, encourages subcontracting for labor management,
and recruits workers in a manner that results in a chronic oversupply
of labor. To obtain the report, <I>Migrant Farmworkers: Pursuing
Security in an Unstable Labor Market, </I>contact<B> Ruth Samardick</B>,

<H3>EPA, USDA Agree to Develop Pesticide Alternatives </H3>

<P>
On August 15 '1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture (USDA) announced an
agreement to coordinate regulatory actions against high-risk pesticides
with efforts to search for safer alternatives. According to the
agreement, EPA and USDA will identify cases where producers will
face a lack of pest management tools due to regulatory action.
 USDA would then work with both the agriculture and research communities
to identify and develop alternative pest control methods. This
will be done in part through a competitive grants program within
a research and technology transfer program.  To start the new
process, EPA has recently listed 36 pesticides to be phased out
under the terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit brought
by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).  Among the pesticides
and their uses are alachlor, used on soybeans and peanuts; benomyl,
a fungicide used on apples, citrus, grapes, rice and tomatoes;
captan, used on grapes, plums, and tomatoes; mancozeb, used on
cereal grains and grapes; and dicofol, used on fruits and tomatoes.

<P>
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has released a report praising
the SARE program for increasing interest and research in sustainable
agriculture. The same report laments that many SARE program goals
are undercut by conflicts with other USDA programs. The report
notes the fragmentation of sustainable agriculture programs among
nine separate agencies headed by four assistant secretaries and
two under secretaries. No departmental policy currently exists
to guide the efforts of these scattered programs. For copies of
the report, <I>Sustainable Agriculture: Program Management, Accomplishments,

<H3><B>Whitten replaced as chair of House Agricultural Appropriations
<BR>
</B></H3>

<P>
Rep.<B> Jamie Whitten</B>, a Mississippi Democrat, was removed
in December from his powerful roles as chair of the House Appropriations
Committee and the Agricultural Appropriations subcommittee. He
had served in the latter role for the past 33 years, a position
from which he controlled USDA and FDA spending. He was often described
as the real Secretary of Agriculture, as he controlled the Department's
purse strings regardless of who was Secretary or which party was
in power. Whitten was not considered a friend of sustainable agriculture
and his departure marks an opportunity for reconsidering USDA
spending patterns. Whitten's replacement as chair of the Agricultural
Appropriations Subcommittee is <B>Richard J. Durbin</B>, a Democrat
from Illinois. See &quot;Old Order Changes as Whitten Pushed Aside,&quot;

<H3><B>Self-reliant City Food Systems<BR>
</B></H3>

<P>
Political scientist <B>Kenneth A. Dahlberg</B> is working with
a project to encourage cities to become more self-reliant and
efficient in operating their local food systems. Dahlberg and
others have worked to create a Food Policy Council in cities like
Knoxville, Tennessee. Dahlberg writes, &quot;One of the major
challenges at this point is that few citizens or officials are
aware of the extent and complexity of their local food systems,
much less their potential. This is reflected in the fact that
no city has a Department of Food. Equally, few people are aware
that the value of the produce from all U.S. gardens (urban and
rural) is roughly equivalent to that of the corn crop (approximately
$18 billion/year!).&quot; See &quot;Knoxville Serves as Model
for Local Food Systems,&quot; in <I>Nutrition Week, </I>Jan. 1,
1993, pages 4-5.<BR>

<P>
A recent study by three South Dakota State University professors
examined the economic and social implications of a shift from
conventional to sustainable agriculture. Part of the study focused
on the impacts of such a conversion on rural community economic
viability. The researchers concluded that during the transition
some difficult economic adjustments might cause an overall decline
in rural community economic health, unless government policies
to support the transition are adopted. They believe that, in the
long term, sustainable agriculture will benefit rural communities,
especially if systems are developed that enhance moderate-sized
family farms, leading to the need for new local marketing facilities,
machinery, and services. See <B>Thomas L. Dobbs, Donald Taylor</B>,
and <B>James D.Smolik</B>, <I>Farm, Rural Economy and Policy Implications

<P>
Work is under way to create a California Sustainable Agriculture
Working Group (CA SAWG). The group would be modeled after similar
groups in other states and regions, such as the Midwest Sustainable
Agriculture Working Group. Among the aims of the group would be
to provide grass roots input from California into the national
level policy discussions that will shape the 1995 Farm Bill, as
well as state and local policy initiatives. For more information,

<P>
The Institute for Sustainable Forestry in Redway, California has
developed criteria for a certification and labeling program for
ecologically harvested forest products. The program is known as
Pacific Certified Ecological Forest Products (PCEFP). The criteria
for the certification program are copyrighted as <I>The Ten Elements
of Sustainability. </I>Among the elements are forest practices
that maintain and/or restore the natural processes of the forest
ecosystem, surface and groundwater quality, soil fertility, and
a natural balance and diversity of native species in the area
ecosystem. For more information contact The Institute for Sustainable
Forestry, P.O. Box 1580, Redway,CA 95560. <BR>

<H1>Sources of Funding</H1>
<H3>USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Education Program
</H3>
<P>
The USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (formerly
LISA) program has issued a call for proposals for the Western
Region of the United States.  The deadline for proposals for the
West is February 28, 1992.  The program expects to fund one whole-farm
systems proposal for $150-300,000 per year.  It is possible that
a whole-farm systems project would be jointly funded by the Environmental
Protection Agency's Agriculture in Concert with the Environment
(EPA/ACE) Program, if components of the project meet the EPA/ACE
criteria.  Additionally, the ACE Program will be funding an undetermined
number of projects in 1992.  Proposals are requested for studies
that will identify, evaluate, and interpret indicators of agroecosystem
health. In addition to the commonly used indicators of productivity,
projects supported by ACE must consider indicators of the function
or disfunction of the agroecosystem, including measures of environmental
quality, ecological soundness and species diversity, as well as
socioeconomic viability.  To be added to the mailing list or for
further information contact <B>Denise Bodie</B>, University of
California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 300
Lakeside Dr., 6th Floor, Oakland, CA 94612-3560, (510) 987-0033.

<H3>Charles Lindbergh Fund</H3>
<P>
The non-profit Charles A. Lindbergh Fund supports the goals of
aviator Charles Lindbergh who believed that the future depends
upon a balance between the environment and technological progress.
 Each year the Lindbergh Fund provides grants of up to $10,580
(a symbolic amount representing the cost of &quot;The Spirit of
St. Louis&quot;) to individuals whose work furthers this balance.
 Categories for the awards are: 1) aviation/aerospace, 2) agriculture,
3) the arts and humanities, 4) biomedical research, 5) conservation
of natural resources, 6) exploration, 7) health and population
sciences, 8) intercultural communication, 9) oceanography, 10)
waste disposal management, 11) water resource management, 12)
wildlife preservation.  Grants will be limited to research or
educational projects that focus on a balance between the advancement
of technology and preservation of the human/natural environment.
 Grants are directed at individuals rather than institutional
programs.  The Fund welcomes candidates who may or may not be
affiliated with an academic or non-profit institution.  It does
not provide support for tuition, scholarships, fellowships or
related travel.  The Lindbergh Grants Program is international;
all application materials must be submitted in English and be
postmarked by June 16, 1992.  For applications and more information

proposals on control methods for mosquitos and related topics
for the 1992-93 academic year. To be considered for funding, proposals
must be received no later than Friday, January 17, 1991.  The
goal of  the Mosquito Research Program is to conduct research
which will provide improved methods of managing pest and disease-transmitting
mosquitos.  Emphasis is on principles of integrated pest management,
including practical biological control strategies and other approaches
which are not disruptive to the environment.  Proposal categories
include: chemical control methods (including application technology),
mosquito biology and ecology, integrated pest management (including
biological control), and public health.  For complete application
information contact <B>Bruce Eldridge</B>, director, Universitywide
Mosquito Research Program, Department of Entomology, University
of California, Davis, CA 95616, (916) 752-6983.<BR>
<H3>Toxic Substances Program</H3>
<P>
The UC Toxic Substances Program will provide seed funding for
innovative grants in any area of research relevant to problems
of toxic substances in California.  The emphasis in this call
for proposals is on the development of new ideas by investigators
in any discipline.  The Program is especially seeking strong research
proposals dealing with studies of the economics of toxic substances
issues, potential public policy implications of toxic substances
issues, source reduction, and coastal and marine toxic substances
issues.  Investigators are particularly encouraged to seek funding
for the development of preliminary data that will provide the
basis for subsequent applications to extramural funding sources.
 Those projects should be able to be completed in a year or less
and require a direct cost budget of less than $50,000<I>.  </I>Proposals
related to toxics curriculum development are also encouraged.
 Applications must be received by January 31, 1992; however, it
is recommended that proposals be submitted to the UC Davis Office
of Research by January 25, 1992.  For complete application information
contact <B>Melissa Mardesich</B>, Toxic Substances Program manager,
California Regional Primate Research Center, University of California,

<H1> Cover Crops in Central Coast Farming Systems</H3>
<I>by Davis Chaney, SAREP</I><P>


<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>armers and ranchers often question whether or not cover crops can supply enough nitrogen for the cash crops they grow. This question is particularly important in vegetable cropping systems where the amount and timing of nitrogen uptake is crucial to both the yield and quality of the harvested crop. Two SAREP-funded projects coordinated by Richard Smith, a UC Cooperative Extension farm advisor in San Benito County, are providing answers to these questions for farmers in California's Central Coast Region. <P>

<H3>Organically Grown Bell Peppers</H3>

In 1992 Smith received funding to explore the feasibility of using cover crops prior to planting bell peppers, an unusually long-season crop with a high demand for nitrogen (about 250 pound per acre over a five-month growing season). Supplying sufficient nitrogen to bell peppers in organic production systems is particularly challenging. Can the soil be conditioned to meet this demand over 150 days? A well grown leguminous cover crop can supply 200 to 250 pounds of nitrogen that the subsequent crop can use, but according to Smith, the release of this nitrogen reaches a peak about 75 to 80 days following incorporation into the soil. Under these conditions, will there be enough nitrogen for the remainder of the growing season? <BR>
In Smith's study, nitrogen from a lana vetch cover crop (about 200 pounds per acre) was supplemented with 0, 25, 50, and 100 pounds of nitrogen in the form of feather meal. Feather meal is an organic form of nitrogen that releases nitrogen over 120 days. Smith felt that the slow release form of nitrogen would complement the relatively fast release by the cover crop. The results of his study indicate that the cover crop nitrogen was running out toward the end of the season, as evidenced by the petiole nitrate levels which were below the conventional critical level of 700 ppm in the 0 and 25 pounds per acre treatments, and the fact that the unfertilized plants had turned yellow by the end of the season. Nitrogen applications of 50 and 100 pounds per acre as feather meal provided adequate nitrogen to the bell peppers over the season to maintain the recommended petiole nitrate levels, but, Smith said, this added nitrogen did not lead to any significant increase in yield. When Smith repeated his study in 1993, the additional nitrogen in the 50 and 100 pounds per acres treatments did result in significant yield increases. 

<H3>Organic, Conventional Systems</H3>
In 1995 Smith began a new study aimed at providing organic farmers with better information about how to monitor the nitrogen status of their crops. As the bell pepper study revealed, growers that utilize organic sources of nitrogen such as compost and cover crops are able to provide enough nitrogen to meet the crop demands, but they have to pay close attention to how that nitrogen is released over the course of the season. University of California researchers have been conducting a number of studies over the past several years to determine critical levels of nitrate in the fresh sap of vegetables (as measured by hand-held selective electrode nitrate meters) to aid growers in making quick fertility decisions. These tests have proven to be useful in conventional production systems using chemical fertilizers. There is increasing evidence, however, that organic farms have lower soil and plant nitrate levels and yet are achieving yields comparable to conventional systems. Thus the applicability of these tests and established critical values may be of limited value in organic farming systems.<BR>
In order to determine the value of the fertility tests to organic growers, Smith set up a project to monitor nitrogen in four farms producing long day onions: two organic farms using compost, cover crops and feather meal; and two conventional farms. Soil nitrate and ammonium were monitored, as well as nitrate levels in the fresh sap of root tissue and the total nitrogen in the onion tops.<BR>
As found in other studies, there were dramatic differences in the levels of soil nitrate and ammonium between conventional and organic systems. Nitrate levels were similar at the beginning of the season (about 20 ppm), but by mid-June nitrate in the conventionally farmed soils increased to 76 ppm and remained significantly greater than in the organic system until the end of the season. Nitrate levels on the organic farms remained constant at about 15 ppm through the entire season. A similar pattern was found with soil ammonium. Nitrate in the onion plants (both roots and tops) was also lower in the organic system than in the conventional system, according to Smith.<BR>
One of the organic farms had a severe pink root disease problem, so yields could not be considered in the final analysis. The yields from the other organic farm, however, were comparable to the yield from the two conventional fields, even though the soil nitrate and ammonium levels were low and the levels of nitrate-nitrogen in the roots and total nitrogen in the tops were much lower.<BR>
Smith said these results indicate that quick test technology measuring nitrate-nitrogen in the fresh sap may not be a useful diagnostic tool for organic farmers. The organic onions in this study obtained reasonably adequate supplies of nitrogen even though plant nitrate levels were low, so the question arises, how did they do this without the large pools of nitrogen in the soil? Smith is planning further research to help find an answer to this question and to determine whether revised critical levels are needed for organic systems.

<H1><B>Decomposition and nitrogen mineralization in natural and
agroecosystems: the contribution of soil animals.</B></H1>

<P>
<I>H.A. Verhoef and L. Brussaard</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Biogeochemistry 11:175-211. 1990<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This review (105 references) discusses the contribution of soil
microfauna to nitrogen mineralization.  The article contains six
major sections: 1) A functional classification of the soil fauna
based on their role in the decomposition process. 2) Findings
from studies of natural and agricultural ecosystems. 3) Interactions
between various soil fauna. 4) The effects of abiotic factors
on faunal decomposition. 5) Effects of other environmental disruptions
on soil fauna. 6) Areas for further research.<BR>

<H3>Functional Classifications</H3>

<P>
Three classifications are discussed in this section: size, habitat,
and food.  Size (measured in body width) is often used since it
broadly reflects the scale at which the various fauna affect soil
processes.  The size distinctions and species found in each group
are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Microfauna (2m - l00m).  Includes nematodes and protozoa.
<LI>Mesofauna <B>(</B>100m<B> - </B>2 mm).  Includes collembola,
mites, enchytraeids and others.
<LI>Macrofauna (2mm - 20mm).  Includes millipedes, woodlice, fly
larvae, beetles, snails and earthworms.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Habitat classifications are usually based on the depth in the
soil profile at which the animal lives.  Earthworm species, for
example, are identified as either epigeal (surface-active), endogeic
(subsurface) or anecic (active between the surface and subsurface
layers).  Similar stratifications have been described for certain
types of spiders and collembola.<BR>

The third classification, food, is largely based on the
trophic relationships between different groups of soil animals.
 According to the authors, this classification is more complex
than either size or habitat, but it is more useful for evaluating
the effect of different soil-dwelling species on decomposition
and mineralization.

<H3>Contribution to Nitrogen Mineralization</H3>

<P>
Studies from forest and grassland ecosystems indicate that soil
fauna are responsible for about 30 percent of total net nitrogen
mineralization.  In one study of a forest system estimates ranged
from 10 to 49 percent, depending on the assimilation efficiency
factor used in the calculations.  The grassland study showed that
amoebae and nematodes together accounted for over 83 percent of
the nitrogen mineralized by all fauna.  Another study conducted
in an agricultural system estimated that soil fauna contributed
25 percent to net nitrogen mineralization.  This is in close agreement
with studies from the natural systems, especially considering
the variation in faunal activity resulting from environmental
and management factors.
<H3>Population Dynamics</H3>

<P>
The amount of nitrogen contributed by the soil fauna is closely
correlated with their population densities.  These numbers can
fluctuate considerably even over short periods of time, and reveal
a complex set of interactions amongst the various groups of fauna.
 Paradoxically, according to several studies, the rate of organic
matter decomposition appears to proceed independent of these changes
in faunal populations.  How can this paradox be explained? According
to the authors, &quot;&#133;total organism biomass, including
bacterial and fungal biomass [flora and fauna], may be a poor
indicator of biological activity.  Rather than pointing to the
low importance of the fauna at the observed level of microbial
biomass, this may instead indicate that the microbial biomass
is kept at a low level by microbial grazers.  In their turn, the
grazers may not build up a large biomass, but instead be consumed
by predators.  Hence it appears that in a variety of ecosystems,
microbial grazers and their predators [soil fauna] significantly
contribute to the mineralization of nitrogen, despite their often
low biomass.&quot;<BR>

<H3>Abiotic Factors</H3>

<P>
Soil moisture and temperature are the key environmental variables
influencing the activity of soil fauna.  Several studies have
shown an important phenomenon where moisture stress is concerned.
 While bacterial and fungal decomposition are slowed down (and
ultimately cease) with increasing moisture stress, the process
of nitrogen mineralization is continued to some extent where soil
micro- and meso-fauna are active.<BR>

<H3>Management Factors</H3>

<P>
It is generally accepted that adding nutrients to a nutrient deficient
system increases the rate of organic matter decomposition.  This
phenomenon has been observed in numerous studies.  However, many
examples exist in which addition of nitrogen to nitrogen-deficient
systems slows down decomposition, especially where high lignin
organic material is concerned.  The authors' explanation for this
is that nitrogen and other fertilizers can negatively influence
particular groups of organisms, particularly microbes.  Any shift
in microbial composition can have a negative effect on the soil
fauna as well.  As a result, decomposition and mineralization
rate may decrease.<BR>

<P>
Harvesting (particularly in annual cropping systems) and incorporation
of crop residue also have a strong influence on mineralization,
mainly because of the rapid dying-off of roots and the addition
of large amounts of carbon to the soil system.  Few studies, however,
have analyzed the specific effect of harvesting and residue incorporation
on soil fauna and the associated effect on nitrogen dynamics.
 It is likely that the fungi and their predators play a key role
in the mineralization process, but the specific groups involved
have not been quantitatively studied.<BR>

<H3>Further Research</H3>

<P>
The authors explore three important lines for future research:
1) further development of models that help us describe, predict
and manage the contribution of the soil biota to nutrient turnover
in soil; 2) the ability of the soil fauna in managed systems to
make nutrients available when plants need them; and 3) more detailed
study of the interactions between functional groups of soil fauna
to better understand the process of organic matter decomposition.

California Clean Growers Association, a San Joaquin Valley-based
farmer organization promoting natural farming techniques, has
recently formed the Participatory Research Institute (PRI). Its
purpose is to bring farmers and researchers together in a dynamic
working relationship. PRI program director <B>Mas Masumoto</B>
and research director <B>Jeff Dlott</B> have started a monthly
newsletter, <I>On Common Ground.</I> According to Masumoto, &quot;Our
research institute hopes to work with researchers interested not
only in the farm, but also in the farmer.&quot; Projects currently
underway include brown rot disease management in stone fruit,
an implementation model for sustainable farming practices in stone
fruit funded by the California Energy Commission, and a database
of farmer indigenous knowledge and experience. For more information,

<H3>Cal EPA Weakens Methyl Bromide 'Right to Know'<BR>
</H3>

<P>
On December 22,1993, California's Environmental Protection Agency
(Cal EPA) reversed its January 1993 decision to list methyl bromide
under Proposition 65. This action means that farmworkers and other
rural residents will not have the &quot;right-to-know&quot; when
the pesticide is used in agricultural production. Under the terms
of Proposition 65, growers would have been required to warn anyone
living or working within four miles when methyl bromide was to
be used. Applications of methyl bromide for structural fumigation
will still be listed under Proposition 65, but uses for agricultural
purposes will now be exempt. Five environmental and labor organizations
have sued Cal EPA over the new ruling Scientific studies required
by Proposition 65 indicate that methyl bromide can cause birth
defects and genetic mutations in laboratory tests. For more information,

10, 1994; tel: (415) 541 9140.<BR>

<H3>Coalition Asks Clinton to Lead Sustainable Ag  <BR>
</H3>

<P>
A coalition of 116 local and national organizations has written
<B>President Clinton</B>, Agriculture Secretary <B>Mike Espy</B>
and Environmental Protection Agency head <B>Carol Browner</B>,
encouraging the federal government to take an active leadership
role in promoting sustainable agriculture. The letter followed
the Clinton Administration's June 1993 pledge to promote sustainable
agriculture and reduce pesticide use. Among the specific actions
requested in the letter were: revising water quality and pest
management programs to link them directly to sustainable agriculture
initiatives; retraining and reorganizing USDA personnel so that
sustainable agriculture becomes the organizing principle of the
agency; and increasing funding for the USDA's Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education (SARE) program, EPA's Agriculture in Concert
with the Environment (ACE), and the Organic Foods Production Act.

<H3>Report Questions Transgenic Crops<BR>
</H3>

<P>
A new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists raises concerns
about the environmental risks associated with transgenic plants
currently being developed and tested. Transgenic plants are crops
that have been genetically engineered to contain traits from unrelated
organisms. Already genes have been added to engineered crops from
organisms as diverse as fireflies, fish, hamsters and chickens.
The report suggests that these applications of biotechnology could
threaten global crop diversity, and pose a number of known and
unknown environmental risks. The agricultural biotechnology industry
hopes to introduce hundreds of transgenic vegetables, grains,
fruits, trees, fiber crops and ornamentals by the turn of the
century. The report, co-authored by<B> Jane Rissler</B> and <B>Margaret</B>
<B>Mellon</B>, is available for $12 from Union of Concerned Scientists,

<H3>Sustainable Ag Consortium<BR>
</H3>

<P>
A broadbased consortium is being formed among researchers, Extension
workers, farmers and advocates to cooperate in building their
individual and collective capacity to develop and foster a sustainable
agriculture. &quot;Effectively shaping national research and extension
policy to support a more sustainable system is the principal rationale
for organizing a consortium,&quot; according to the Consortium's
draft mission statement. &quot;Over 300 natural and social scientists,
farmers and others have indicated interest in joining the Consortium
so far,&quot; says <B>Elizabeth Bird,</B> the Consortium's executive
director For more information, contact Bird at the Center for
Rural Affairs, PO Box 406, Walthill, NE 68067; tel: (402) 846-5428;

<BR>

<P>
The trend toward direct marketing of produce is a way for consumers
to personally connect with farmers and get the best fruits and
vegetables available. At the increasing number of farmers markets
all over the state, this appears to be a very positive interaction-somewhat
different from the rural/urban conflict that is apparent in many
parts of California. At farmers markets, growers get first-hand
reactions to what they produce, which is a helpful &quot;reality
check&quot; about what their end-users like or dislike. Farmers
can also pocket some of the marketing money, which they don't
usually see. For consumers, buying produce grown and picked close
to home at the time it is ready to eat rather than ready to ship
means fruits and vegetables that taste the way they should. Consumers
learn that the best fruits and vegetables to buy are the ones
that are in season, a lesson that helps both them and the farmers.
The consumers get the freshest, best produce and the farmers don't
have to worry about picking immature fruits and vegetables and
shipping them long distances.<BR>

<P>
Another marketing strategy that seems to be catching on fairly
rapidly is ''community supported agriculture&quot; (CSA) or subscription
farming. In this venture, a group of people in a local area and
a farmer agree on the fruits and vegetables they want to buy and
produce. The farmer grows it for the local consumers and delivers
it to them weekly as it is harvested. In most cases people put
money up front to help with the cash flow on the farm. In other
cases they may also provide labor to help with the harvesting.
CSAs bring the producers and consumers into much closer contact;
those who don't farm begin to understand the concept of the seasonality
of fresh food and some of the problems of producing it.<BR>

<P>
These trends suggest that people do want &quot;real&quot; food.
UC SAREP will be sponsoring a meeting on the development of CSAs
at UC Davis on December 6 (see this page.) The answer to the question
of getting seasonal produce to consumers when it is at the peak
of taste may be closer to home than we think<I>.-<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>,

<H1>Drought &amp; Sustainability</H1>
<P>
<I>by Dave Chaney &amp; Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
The current drought, possibly more than any other issue this century,
raises serious questions about the sustainability of California
agriculture.  Concerns about economic viability, food safety,
groundwater contamination, and farm labor health and safety have
motivated both researchers and farmers to develop more environmentally
sound, resource-enhancing production systems.  But none of these
can match the implications, anxiety and urgency of a severe drought.
<BR>
<P>
Surface water supplies are the hardest hit and farmers in many
irrigation districts are already feeling the pinch.  Growers in
some locations will receive 25 percent or less of their normal
deliveries.  The ramifications of these restrictions depend on
the crop grown and on whether other sources of water are available.
 It is likely that in some areas, the acreage planted to field
and vegetable crops will be drastically reduced.  Already established
orchards and vineyards require a certain amount of water to stay
alive, but the chances of actually harvesting tree or vine crops
will depend on growers being able to locate other sources of water.
<BR>
<P>
Groundwater is the major alternative to decreasing surface supplies,
but drilling a well can be very costly and take up to six weeks
or more.  Furthermore, as farmers increase groundwater pumping
or drill additional wells the depth to groundwater gradually increases.
 This adds to the expense of drilling a well and compounds the
groundwater overdraft problem.  (Overdraft occurs  when  more
groundwater is pumped than is replaced each year by percolation.)
 Among the side effects of overdrafts are the increased cost of
pumping water and declining water quality.<BR>
<P>
Another reason the drought is a focal point for agricultural sustainability
is the  increasing  tension  between urban/industrial demands
for water and agriculture.  An indicator of this can be seen in
estimates for changes in water use between the years 1985 and
2010 (Table 1).  Overall, the demand for water is expected to
increase by 4.2 percent during this period, largely in the urban
sector.<BR>

<P>
Population growth in California will significantly increase municipal
and industrial demands.  In contrast, net water use in agriculture
is estimated to decline slightly.  This is based on the assumption
that California agriculture may become somewhat less competitive
in national and international markets.  Water officials estimate
that the demand in the year 2010 will outstrip supply by about
2.1 million acre feet.  In a serious drought situation this deficit
would be even greater.<BR>
<P>
The prospect of a very long-term drought compounds the problem
even further.  Historical data shows that we are faced with the
distinct possibility  of  continued  below average rainfall. 
In 1980 the California Department of Water Resources funded a
study by the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research
that showed a 50-year drought during the late 1700s and early
1800s (Figure 1).<BR>
<P>
<B>Figure 1. Long Term Reconstructed California Precipitation
not available<BR>
</B>
<P>
Precipitation was lower in each of these years than during the
dry seven-year span from 1928 through 1934 which the DWR uses
for planning projects with sufficient capacity to furnish a reliable
water supply.  Thus, California's water planning may be based
on relatively optimistic estimates of drought conditions. (<I>Association
of California Water Agencies, 1989</I>)<BR>
<P>
Another long dry period identified in the tree ring study included
a 20-year period between 1865 and 1885, which wiped out the cattle
industry in Southern California.  Even if average or high rainfall
years punctuate long drought periods, the basic problem remains:
 How to meet the water demands of agriculture and a growing population
with limited supplies.<BR>
<H3>Water Wise Farmers</H3>
<P>
What can farmers and ranchers do to make the most of limited water
supplies and increase the stability of their farming systems during
drought periods?  Based on recommendations by University of California
researchers, there are several key points that apply to all farmers
and ranchers.  These include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Improve the receptivity of rainfall catchment areas.
<LI>Enhance soil water infiltration and soil water holding capacity
by increasing soil organic    matter.
<LI>Match water applications closely to crop needs.
<LI>Improve the efficiency of irrigation systems.
<LI>Reduce evapotranspiration with windbreaks.
<LI>Try to begin the season with a full profile of soil water.
<LI>Control weeds that could compete with the crop for valuable
soil moisture.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Field, Vegetable Crops</H3>
<P>
In conjunction with the principles outlined above, there are three
additional recommendations that apply specifically to annual cropping
systems.<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>Plan ahead.  </B>Determine what your water supply will<B>
</B>be and then decide the acres that can be effectively irrigated
with that amount of water.  Use your best land for limited plantings.
<LI><B>Crop selection and rotation. </B> Select crops and growing
seasons which use less water. Winter grains, for example, use
significantly less water than summer field and vegetable crops.
If you plant during the summer, choose short season crops and
varieties.
<LI><B>Know the critical stress periods for your crops</B>.  Table
2 provides that information for<B> </B>several field and vegetable
crops.  It is particularly important to avoid<B> </B>drought stress
during these developmental stages.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Tree Crops</H3>
<P>
&quot;Tree growers have more potential to minimize adverse effects
of deficit irrigation on crop production than do field and row
crop growers.  This is due mostly to the greater separation between
the vegetative and reproductive growth stages in trees.&quot;
 This is according to a<B> </B>document entitled<B> </B><I>Irrigation
Management for Fruit and Nut Trees Under 1991 Drought Conditions,
</I>which is available through most farm advisor offices.  The
author is <B>Dave Goldhamer</B>, extension specialist at Kearney
Agricultural Center, who has performed numerous water stress experiments
on other nut and tree crops.  Goldhamer also wrote a more extensive
1989 UC publication, <I>Drought Irrigation Strategies for Deciduous
Orchards.<BR>
</I>
<P>
There are specific periods in the growing season during which
applied water can be reduced or withheld from tree crops without
significant yield losses, according to Goldhamer.  At other times,
deficit irrigation can result in substantial loss in yields in
either the current season, the following season, or both. These
critical periods vary with each tree species, and the 1991 report
suggests general strategies based on tree species.  In general,
the drought-sensitive growth stages are early season (bud break
through fruit set), fruit growth and development, and postharvest.

<P>
<I>Early season.  </I>Early spring growth is needed to establish
the fruiting wood for the following year's crop.  It is therefore
essential to supply adequate water early in the season; this is
done by starting the season with a nearly full soil water profile.
<BR>
<P>
<I>Fruit Growth and Development.  </I>Adequate water is required
during the rapid growth of fruits which exhibit  a  &quot;double
 sigmoid  fruit development pattern,&quot; but stress can be imposed
during the &quot;lag (stage 2) phase of growth.&quot;  Generally,
nut growth is less sensitive to water stress than fruit growth,
but other yield and quality components may be affected.<BR>
<P>
<I>Postharvest.  </I>With the exceptions of almond and apricot,
&quot;the period after harvest is generally most water stress
tolerant.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Other considerations in a drought year include good irrigation
scheduling and proper irrigation system design, according to Goldhamer.
 Also, young trees should be fully irrigated since the goal is
to maximize vegetative growth to bring trees into bearing early.
 Finally, some growers may be considering very severe pruning
in order to simply keep their trees alive.  This will greatly
reduce water use, but only at the expense of production for several
years.  An even more drastic step would be to cut off all scaffold
branches at waist level, a practice known as &quot;dehorning.&quot;
 Goldhamer advises using this measure only if eight acre-inches
or less water are available for the season.  This drastic step
would probably not be needed on pistachio or walnut, and trees
of some species, such as almond, may never recover to their full
size.<BR>
<P>
<I>Almond Research.  </I>Critical information has recently been
developed on managing almonds with deficit irrigation.  <B>Terry
Prichard</B>, water management specialist in Stockton recently
reported on first year results of a four-year irrigation study.
 In this experiment, yield was not affected by up to 50 percent
deficit irrigation, although the number of stick-tight hulls at
harvest increased significantly.  Similarly, in the first year
of an irrigation cutoff study performed by Goldhamer, hull-splitting
was reduced as the length of the preharvest water cutoff interval
in-creased.  Yields of all cutoff treatments were similar, even
alter two years. However, withholding the postharvest irrigation
resulted in significantly lower yields in all the cutoff treatments
in the second year.<BR>
<H3>Range, Pasture</H3>
<P>
The following tips are from an article by Plumas-Sierra counties
farm advisor <B>Holly George</B> (March 1991 newsletter):<BR>
<P>
Roots transport moisture and nutrients to growing plants.  When
plants are overgrazed, root growth stops; when root growth stops,
leaf growth stops too.<BR>
<P>
<I>Irrigated pasture management </I>practices which encourage
root and leaf growth are the same practices which allow plants
to make the best use of soil moisture.  They include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>rotation grazing with adequate rest and regrowth periods
<LI>leaving 4-6 inches of top growth at the end of each grazing
period
<LI>fertilizing properly
<LI>applying irrigation water in the right amount at the right
time.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<I>Range and dry pasture </I>forage production depends entirely
on natural moisture.  Overgrazing during a drought does more damage
to perennial plants than during a season of normal moisture. 
It reduces plant vigor, stops root and leaf growth, reduces ground
cover, and invites accelerated erosion.  Once erosion begins,
it tends to get worse each year, further reducing plant vigor
and forage production.  This process is difficult to reverse.
<BR>
<P>
Rather than risk permanent damage to grazing resources:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>reduce livestock numbers to balance with forage supply
<LI>cull herds more than normal
<LI>sell calves and lambs early
<LI>determine forage needs and buy needed supplements early 
<LI>grow small grains or sorghums for hay or pasture (these need
less water than conventional forage crops)
<LI>defer planting perennial pasture, hay, or range seedings until
a year with more favorable water outlook
<LI>keep spring developments, stock tanks, float valves, and pipelines
in good working order so water is not wasted
<LI>cover troughs and tanks to reduce evaporation
<LI>prepare for hauling stock water
<LI>give spring development high priority (even mediocre springs
will be helpful)
<LI>consider herding or other livestock distribution methods to
make use of under-used areas
<LI>don't overgraze or otherwise disturb streambank vegetation
(it will be needed to prevent erosion, reduce sediment, and provide
food and cover for wildlife)
<LI>well-established seedlings can tolerate heavy use better than
native range.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<I>Wildlife </I>will suffer during a drought as much or more than
domestic livestock.  The wildlife that shares your land is a valuable
natural resource.  To help wildlife:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>include additional features at stock water developments which
will allow small animals and birds safe access to water (these
are usually not expensive and are easily installed)
<LI>fence ponds and springs and install collector pipes to deliver
water to a tank or trough. This will save the water source from
damage by livestock trampling, as well as allow  access by small
animals and birds to lush vegetation that grows close to wet areas.

<H1>4 Years, 52 Projects:  UC SAREP Progress Report Now Available
<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A progress report documenting the work of SAREP is now available.
 The report includes detailed summaries of the 52<I> </I>projects
SAREP has funded for more than $1.35 million in its first four
years.  SAREP was established in 1986 at the request of the California
Legislature in response to grower and consumer concerns about
agriculture's effect on the environment, rural communities, worker
health, food safety, and producer profitability.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Farmers are at the crossroads,&quot; said <B>Bill Liebhardt</B>,
extension specialist and SAREP director.  &quot;Society wants
agriculture to produce abundant and nutritious food and fiber,
while maintaining the resource base.  Farmers, however, need to
be able to continue to produce in a way that allows them to remain
economically viable.  As a result of these forces, agriculture
and the state of California find themselves in a major transition.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
The progress report represents four years of work by SAREP to
help address concerns about the long-term viability of California
agriculture, Liebhardt said.<BR>
<P>
Those interested can examine the 127-page report at any UC Cooperative
Extension office.  Free copies may be requested from SAREP, University
of California, Davis, CA 95616, (916) 752-7556.<BR>

<H1>Why We Study Organic Agriculture<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Many times we are asked why we
at the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program
focus our efforts in particular areas, especially organic agriculture.
My answer almost always is that we do what we do because the legislation
that created SAREP is very precise. The legislation clearly states
that we should &quot;promote more research and education on sustainable
agricultural practices such as organic methods, biological control
and integrated pest managements, and including the analysis of
economic factors influencing the long term sustainability of California
agriculture.&quot; It requires that we &quot;consider interactions
among soil, plant, water, air, animals, tillage, machinery, labor,
energy and transportation to enhance agricultural efficiency,
public health, and resource conservation.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">If we go back 100 to 150 years,
all agriculture was organic. Even 50 years ago, most farming would
have been considered organic. It is only since World War II that
what is presently called &quot;conventional&quot; agriculture
began to emerge. In fact, we may already be in the post-conventional
phase. Agriculture, as practiced now is represented by a broad
spectrum of practices, from organic to conventional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Should conventional agriculture
be researched? Should organic agriculture be researched? Yes,
they both should, because they both represent very different ideas
about how a major human activity should be conducted. Any idea
or other practice may have merit and provide useful options, and
therefore, may be worthy of study. Universities are places where
many philosophies, ideas, and practices should be allowed to flourish.
We need a wide pool of options to solve contemporary problems.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">I know that the examination of
alternative agricultural practices is not popular with some</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">people, but if that was always
the case, we would still be a hunting-gathering society. </FONT><B>Thomas
Kuhn, </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">in his book </FONT><I>The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions, </I><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">notes
that often when a new model or paradigm becomes dominant, as did
conventional agriculture, most scientists focus on work that refines
that model. They ask questions that are appropriate to that model
and will avoid questions that do not fit. In a sense, a cerebral
monoculture is developed. We are all socialized to believe the
values attributed to the dominant model.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Anything that is different will
have an uphill struggle. The prejudice or bias against organic
agriculture is understandable because it is different from the
current standard, conventional agriculture, and we are comfortable
with what we know. However, if we step back and look at alternative
agricultural paradigms as sources of complementary or new solutions
to present-day problems, then we will have done ourselves a favor
by broadening our options.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">An example of this is the case
of a California conventional farmer and his family who are making
the transition to reduced pesticide use on their 4,000 acres.
The farmer told me that they have learned to be better farmers
in their conventional operation by trying to farm a portion of
their land organically. This is because they had to become better
observers and managers to farm the organic portion. They have
been able to reduce pesticide use on the entire operation by about
65 percent over a five-year period. By opening themselves up to
other possibilities, they benefitted. The very process of trying
to change is a wonderful learning experience. That lesson is a
good one in today's society.-</FONT><I><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, director;

<H1><FONT SIZE=5>Are Case Studies Useful?</FONT></H1>

<P>
<I>by Ann Drescher Mayse, SAREP<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Case studies-descriptions of real-life businesses and the challenges
that they face-are often used by business schools to teach students
practical, holistic problem-solving skills. The same approach
may be useful in learning how to apply sustainable agriculture's
environmental, economic and social principles to practical farming
situations. But many of us at UC are more comfortable talking
only about information that comes from experimental trials, rather
than case studies and other information based on farmers' experiences.
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Recent Study</H3>

<P>
In spring of 1993, I explored the pros and cons of case studies
with five farmers and four farm advisors throughout California.
Eight sample case studies from a wide range of sources were shared
with participants well in advance of the individual telephone
interviews. The sample case studies included: 1) descriptive,
magazine-style articles; 2) research case studies (including on-farm
research and detailed economic analyses); and 3) decision case
studies (a specific type of case study used to analyze an actual
problem to be solved). <BR>

<P>
Reactions to these case studies varied widely. In general, participants
agreed that farmers trust and are able to relate to other farmers,
and that farm-generated information is often more relevant and
&quot;reality&quot; based. Also, case studies can be generated
more quickly than formal, replicated research. For practical,
site-specific information, farmers are the best source. But for
theoretical information, including explanations of why certain
practices work, and how universal the information may be to other
sites and circumstances, a researcher's perspective is often better.
Most participants agreed that every observation, whether from
farmers' experience or from research, should be evaluated on-site,
and qualifying statements about where and how the information
was obtained are important. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Different Formats </H3>

<P>
The preferred format for case studies depends on the person and
the application. Most participants preferred descriptions written
in a personal style that includes photographs and direct quotes
from farmers, as well as information about the farm family and
its goals. Several participants considered the case studies written
in an academic format (as opposed to magazine-style) to be dry
and sometimes boring. While these more academic case studies contain
valuable information, they probably won't hold a grower's interest
long enough to convey that information. The cases written in journalistic
style lacked substance and credibility with some participants,
although most readers found them attractive and interesting. The
decision cases appealed to some for their focus on a particular
problem, but appeared too academic to others. <BR>

<P>
Most participants recommended developing case studies and other
educational materials in several formats and styles to be tailored
to different audiences. For general audiences, short, concise,
well-written articles without too much detail are recommended.
These articles can address a large audience: farmers, policy-makers,
community leaders, and consumers. Growers seeking alternatives
are looking for more information that they find in general articles,
and will be disappointed with case studies that are too short
and general. They will read longer articles on subjects that interest
them, but they still must be written in a friendly, concise manner.
Case studies with detailed information and references are most
useful to these readers. Growers and farm managers seeking specific
information on a single subject may benefit more from a technical
publication including theoretical knowledge and grower experiences.
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Choose Good Growers</H3>

<P>
When asked to design a case study for their own areas, most participants
felt it was important to choose a grower with a good farming reputation
and of a representative size for the area. They recommended including
theoretical information presented in a practical manner; basic
information about weather, location, soil, and farm size; broad
information on farming and marketing practices; ranges of costs,
cash flow, and profitability; and personal information about the
family and the farmer's &quot;vision.&quot; A narrative style,
including quotes from the farmer and photographs of the farmer
and family, was recommended. Case studies might be distributed
within existing newsletters and magazines, or used more interactively
as part of meetings and field days.<BR>

<H3>UC Sustainable Agriculture Program Wins Bronze for Web Site </H3>

<P>UC SAREP has won a bronze Circle of Excellence Award for its Internet
World Wide Web site from the national Council for Advancement and Support
of Education (CASE). The award honors the statewide program for accurately
targeting its audience and communicating its mission via the Web site.
&quot;The World Wide Web is a great way to disseminate the scientific research
we fund on sustainable ag practices and public policies to California farmers,
researchers, consumers, policy makers, UC administrators, and government
officials,&quot; says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, SAREP director. SAREP's staff of
10 contribute information to the site (<A HREF="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu</A>)
which is managed by Tom Bates, SAREP programmer/analyst. The site allows
users to search for and view information on a cover crops database with
400 color images of plants, summaries of dozens of SAREP-funded research
projects, hundreds of newsletter articles and calendar entries. &quot;In
these days of dwindling monetary resources, putting this information on
the Web is an excellent and cost effective way to leverage work that is
already being done,&quot; says <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>, SAREP associate director.
</P>

<H3>This is what the CASE judges had to say about the SAREP Web site:</H3>

<P>Be prepared when you visit this site for a very different kind of Web
experience. No cool graphics; no Javascript; no animations; no Quicktime
or RealAudio. But that's precisely what the judges liked about this site:
it didn't impose massive, unneeded media on its users (who were most likely
connecting over very low-speed connections). Instead, it offered its audience
a massive amount of information that they needed and made the information
easy to find. The site has an excellent search engine and is very easy
to use. </P>

<P>The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Denver Regional
Support Office is operating the Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development.
To help communities design and implement sustainable development (good
for the local economy, environment and quality of life), this new service
will assist communities throughout the United States by providing world-class
consultation and information. Federal, state, and local agencies that assist
community developers are also target customers. </P>

<P>The Center for Sustainable Agricultural Systems was formed in 1991 within
the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln for the purpose of bringing together people and resources
to promote an agriculture that is efficient, profitable, and environmentally
and socially sustainable. The Center uses a systems approach to address
the complex and multidimensional challenges associated with a sustainable
and profitable agriculture. This site has links to information about various
aspects of the program including publications and reports, current activities,
a calendar, and other sustainable-agriculture-related sites, including
UC SAREP and SAN (<A HREF="http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/san">http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/san</A>),

<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The Organic Farming Research Foundation
is offering funds for organic farming methods research, dissemination
of research results to organic farmers and growers interested
in making the transition to organic production systems, and education
of the public about organic farming issues. Projects should involve
farmers in both design and execution, and take place on working
farms whenever possible and appropriate. Proposals of $3,000-$5,000
are encouraged. Most projects will be less than $10,000. Matching
funds from other sources and/or in-kind contributions from cooperators
are encouraged but not required. Proposals are considered twice
a year. Proposals received by July 31, 1993 will be awarded by
November 30, 1993. To receive copies of grant application procedures

<H3>Stewardship Incentive Program</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Federal Stewardship Incentive
Program (SIP) funding of up to $10,000 per land owner per year
is available to private individuals, groups, associations, corporations,
Indian tribes or other legal private entities who own rural lands
with existing tree cover or woody vegetation or land suitable
for growing such vegetation. The Food, Agriculture, Conservation
and Trade Act of 1990 authorizes the SIP to offer cost-sharing
assistance to improve management of nonindustrial private forest
lands. Landowners must maintain and protect SIP-funded practices
for a minimum of ten years. Eligible landowners must have an approved
Forest Stewardship Plan and own up to 1,000 acres of qualifying
land. (Authorizations must be obtained for exceptions of up to
5,000 acres.) Existing management plans can be modified to meet
guidelines. Specific SIP practices approved for cost-share assistance

<H1>Our &quot;New&quot; Newsletter: Fill Out Purge Form</H1>
<P>
Welcome to the first issue of <I>Sustainable Agriculture.  </I>This
new and expanded report from UC SAREP is a combination of the
former <I>Sustainable Agriculture News, </I>our general newsletter,
and <I>Components, </I>the program's journal of technical notes
and reviews.  This change gets our information to you four times
a year, instead of spreading it out over eight editions of two
publications.  It's a more efficient way for you to read it, and
for us to publish it.  We are pleased with the mix of news, announcements,
practical information and technical and research summaries.  And
while we have your attention, please fill out the purge form on
page 15 (your mailing label should be on the back).  As a Cooperative
Extension program, we are required to purge our mailing list yearly
to make sure we are sending publications only to people who want
them.  The University of California's (and the State's) extreme
budget crunch makes this purge more essential than ever.  We hope
you'll want to continue receiving this newsletter-all you need
to do is fill out the form and mail it in.  And good reading!-<I>Lyra

<H1>Soil management for sustainability. </H1>

<P>
<I>R. Lal and F.J. Pierce (Editors)<BR>
</I>
<P>
Soil and Water Conservation Society, Ankeny, IA. 1991<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Increasing awareness of the problems of soil and environmental
degradation have made sustainable soil management an important
topic of research. The rate of soil degradation is estimated at
five to seven million hectares per year. This book describes soil
management issues that pertain to increasing agricultural sustainability.
The book is dedicated to DL William E. Larson who was a pioneer
in sustainable soil management research. <BR>

<P>
The 14 papers that make up the book were presented at a workshop,
&quot;Soil Management for Sustainability&quot; in Edmonton, Alberta,
in August 1989. The workshop examined soil management from three
perspectives. This review highlights a chapter from each of those
perspectives. The first involves soil processes including soil
structure, compaction, and erosion. The second considers management
options including conservation tillage and planting systems, wastewater
sludge use, farming by soil, energy efficiency and agricultural
sustainability. The third perspective takes into account natural
resource assessment policy and research priorities. <BR>

<P>
<B>Erosion Productivity Impact Prediction</B> (F.J. Pierce). This
chapter asserts that it is presently extremely difficult to predict
the effects of soil erosion and productivity. The author recommends
three actions for improving the capability for making predictions.
First, there needs to be standardization of measuring the effects
of soil erosion on productivity and a program to measure the changes
over time. Next, worldwide policies affecting natural resources
need to be monitored to make certain there are incentives for
adopting conservation practices. Finally, there must be efforts
to restore degraded land. <BR>

<P>
<B>Farming by Soil</B> (W.E. Larson and P.C. Robert). This paper
 describes a method of customizing the management of different
soil types in a field to best suit each type. The authors use
data collected from Jackson County, Minnesota, to illustrate their
point. Because all fields show field variability regarding water
drainage, soil texture, organic matter content and other factors,
different treatments for different &quot;soilscape units&quot;
are often necessary. New technologies are making farming-by-soil
easier. For example, computers in the cabs of spreaders can show
field conditions to the farmers as they spread chemicals, enabling
them to customize the treatment of fertilizers and herbicides
for the different soils. Managing treatments on a soil-specific
basis also can potentially reduce water and environmental contamination,
and soil erosion. The author sees farming-by-soil technology as
one of the greatest innovations in soil management in the last
ten years. <BR>

<P>
<B>Sustaining the Resource Base of an Expanding World Agriculture</B>
(B.A. Stewart, R. Lal and S.A. El-Swaify). The authors of this
chapter describe how soil productivity and sustainability are
affected by world agricultural practices. They make recommendations
for the roles soil scientists must take for achieving more sustainability.
Government policies and adoption of new production technologies
need to also support sustainability in terms of land use and appropriate
technology. The chapter focuses on dryland agriculture and discusses
climate and soil as the factors most important in determining
a sustainable system. <BR>

<P>
Other chapters include: The Vanishing Resource; Soil Structure:
Processes and Management; Soil Stresses Important to Management;
Soil Compaction Mechanisms and Their Control; Soil Erosion: Processes,
Impacts, and Prediction; Adoption of Conservation Tillage and
Associated Planting Systems; Management of Agricultural Land Receiving
Wastewater Sludges; Energy Efficiency and Sustainability of Farming
Systems; Natural Resources Assessment and Policy; Soil Management
Research in the Search for Sustainable Agriculture; Soil Management
in the 21st Century. <BR>

<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Bell bean is a coarse, erect, glabrous, very leafy annual, 5 to 20 dm. high; leaves fleshy, glaucous, turning black in drying, without tendrils; leaflets 2 to 6, oval, 4 to 10 cm. long, 1 to 3 cm. wide, obtuse, apiculate; stipules large, semisagittate, entire or shallowly dentate; racemes 2- to 4- flowered, very short-peduncled; flowers large (2 to 3 cm. long), white blotched with deep maroon or blackish violet; pods large (8 to 20 cm. long, 1 to 3 cm.  wide), plump 2- to 4- seeded (Hermann, 1960).  Madson (1951) described the plant as coarse, erect, and stemmy, with a large taproot, and large leaflets.  The flower is white with a black spot on each wing and is borne in sessile axillary racemes. Seeds are large.  Faba bean (cv 'Fiord') at maturity contained 50% of total dry matter and 78% (90 kg/ha) of total nitrogen in the seed, 30 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>In the common variety known as Windsor or broad bean, the seed is flat and about 1 in long by 3/4 in broad.  In the small seeded varieties, the seeds are more rounded and range 3/8 in to more than 1/2 inch in diameter (Madson, 1951).  In small seeded races, seed are nearly glabose and about 7 to 9 mm. in diameter, red-brown, purplish, greenish or black, sometimes spotted with gray; the hilum large, terminal, blackish, about 1/6 to 1/5 the circumference of the seed (Hermann, 1960).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Geographic range varies among cultivars or varieties (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>SCS had difficulty finding seed during winter of 1988 (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This species has variously been termed bell bean (Duke, 1981; Munoz & Graves, 1988), broad bean (Hermann, 1960), faba bean (Bugg et al., 1989), Fava bean (Slayback, pers. comm.), field bean (Brinton, 1989), horse bean (Duke, 1981; Slayback, pers. comm.), tick beans (Duke, 1981; Brinton, 1989), and Windsorbean (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I> Vicia faba </I></B> L. (Duke, 1981).  Some refer to bell beans as <I>Vicia faba</I></B> var. <I>minor</I></B> or <I>equina</I></B> (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>In general, bell bean does not respond favorably to mowing or grazing (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  It can tolerate some high mowing for frost control (Peaceful Valley, 1988) but will not withstand close mowing (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Pears et al. (1989) says that it can be cut down once and left to regrow.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Bell bean tolerates a wide variety of soils (Peaceful Valley, 1988), doing well in loam to clay soils (Madson, 1951; Munoz & Graves, 1988), and best in well drained, heavy silt or clay loams with large quantities of humus and calcium.  Pears et al. (1989) say that it does best on heavy soils, whereas Duke (1981) maintains that it performs best on rich loam soils.  This species can be grown successfully on light soil with ample moisture and lime (McLeod, 1982).  According to Miller (1988), it can be useful on heavy soils, because residue persists after being disked in.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Bell bean has been said to tolerate basic to acidic soils (Munoz & Graves, 1988), ranging from pH of 4.5-8.3 (mean of 87 cases, 6.6) (Duke, 1981), and the crop is grown without liming throughout the U.S. (Duke, 1981).  However, nodulation may be delayed under acid conditions (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).  Faba bean (cv 'Herz Freya') showed delayed nodulation where soil pH was low.  White lupin (cv 'Eldo') showed no decrease in N-fixation (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989)<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Planting dates have been variously suggested as early Fall (Munoz & Graves, 1988), early to mid-Fall (Peaceful Valley, 1988), October - November (Madson, 1951), and with the earliest spring crops (Duke, 1981).  Seedling growth and nodulation were both much slower at 10 degrees C than at 15 or 20 degrees C for faba bean cv 'Fiord' which may suggest problems with late autumn sowing (Herdina and Silsbury, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates for bell bean have been given as 80 to 125 lb/acre (Peaceful Valley, 1988), 100 - 200 lb/acre (Miller, 1988; Munoz & Graves, 1988), 125 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982), 125 to 175 lbs/acre (Madson, 1951; Miller et al. 1989), and are 225-340 kg/ha for large-seeded varieties, and 190 kg/ha for small-seeded types (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed price has been stated as $0.30/lb (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and as $0.26/lb retail in 1993 by Fred Thomas (pers comm.).  Madson (1951) cited high cost as the principal deterrent to use of bell bean.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Beel bean needs Type "Q" inoculant (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Rhizobial strains TA 101 and SU 391 prompted rapid nodulation on pea; the former was better at nodulating pea cultivar A102 than cv 'Early Dun'.  Both rhizobial strains TA 101 and SU 391 were very slow to nodulate faba bean cv 'Fiord'.  Seedling growth and nodulation were both much slower at 10 degrees C than at 15 or 20 degrees C for faba bean cv 'Fiord,' suggesting possible problems with late autumn sowing (Herdina and Silsbury, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Bell bean adds a large amount of organic matter to the soil when turned in as green manure (McLeod, 1982).  The best time for incorporation is at blossom (McLeod, 1982; Munoz & Graves, 1988). The vegetation will decompose more rapidly if the plants are succulent, but in general, bell bean residue persists longer than that of other leguminous cover crops, which can help improve heavy soils (Miller, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Small-seeded varieties of faba beans are called bell beans (Miller, 1988).  Varieties include 'Windsor,' 'Longpod,' 'Dwarf Fan,' 'Julienne,' 'Lorraine,' 'Black Spanish,' 'Mazagan,' 'Piccardy,' and 'Winter' (Duke, 1981).  Varieties of bell beans with the highest biomass production are 'Ackerperle,' 'Herz Freya,' 'Aladin,' and 'Minnesota Horsebean' (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Heights range from 60 to 90 cm (Pears et al., 1989).  Some varieties can attain a height of up to 6 ft. on fertile, warm soils (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Cv 'Ipro' reached a height of 0.85 m (Bugg and Ellis, 1989) and an unnamed variety sowed in a Mendocino vineyard reached 121.92 +/- 10.78 m (mean +/-1 - SEM (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> <P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Bell bean tolerates a wide variety of drainage conditions (Peaceful Valley, 1988) but will not tolerate drought (Duke, 1981; Pears et al., 1989; Husain et al., 19xx), which at flowering or pod formation can cause severe reduction of seed yields (Koscielniak et al., 1989).  In northern Germany, droughts during May and June cause low pod set of spring-sown faba bean.  Bell bean is notorious for unstable yields, which appear in part due to its susceptibility to drought (Herzog, 1989).  Bell bean can be grown with from 2.3-20.9 DM of precipitation (mean of 95 cases = 12.1) (Duke, 1981).  Husain, 19xx) found that roots of drought-stressed faba bean (cv 'Maris Bead') extended as far as 0.85 m in depth.  Average rooting depth was 0.70 m for drought-stressed and 0.52 m for irrigated plants.  As drought stress increases, faba bean shows the following responses: (1) rate of shoot height increase declines; (2) leaf area expansion decreases slightly; (3) root growth increases; (4) smaller leaves are produced; (5) leaves are shed; (6) shoot dry matter decreases.  It has been thought that faba bean is most sensitive to drought stress during flowering because root growth ceases at this point for well-irrigated plants.  This is not the case with drought-stressed plants, i.e., root growth can continue.  Thus, sensitivity to drought is more or less uniform throughout the development of the plant.  Reid (1990), based on simulation modeling, suggests that increased root growth was the most effective adaptation by which faba bean copes with drought stress, at least until 21 days from maturity.  Breeding programs should probably emphasize the ability of plants to respond in this fashion.  Deep tillage may also be beneficial in removing impediments to deep rooting.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Peaceful Valley (1988) suggested that beneficial insects do well on the numerous blossoms, but extrafloral nectaries appearing as dark spots on the stipules are probably more important (Bugg, pers. comm.).  These nectaries occur from early vegetative growth through late pod filling.  From mid September through late October, sixty specimens of Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera), representing 20 species and 4 subfamilies, were observed feeding at the extrafloral nectaries (cv 'Ipro').  Of the ichneumonids collected, 3 were known parasites of lepidopterous pests of agriculture, 2 of forest Lepidoptera, and three of both agricultural and forest Lepidoptera (Bugg et al., 1989).  Trujillo-Arriaga and Altieri (1990) grew faba bean in tricultures with maize and squash.  Faba bean provided extrafloral nectar that was fed upon by the lady beetles <I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> and <I>H. koebelei</I></B>.  This probably contributed to the observed greater densities of these lady beetles, the higher yield of maize, and the elevated total output per unit area (land equivalent ratio=2.89) in the tricultures. Densities of lady beetles appeared relatively low in all treatments, and inferential statistics were not presented.<P> Bell bean is regarded as more susceptible to aphid infestations than the vetches (Miller, 1988); in particular, it is attacked by bean aphid (<I>Aphis fabae</I></B> L.) which seldom affects its use as a cover crop but often interferes with the production of seed (Madson, 1951).  Bugg and Ellis (1989) reported that a May-planted crop of faba bean was heavily infested by bean aphid, which apparently damaged the crop.  Bean aphid was tended by <I>Formica</I></B> spp. ants, which were observed repelling some lady beetles.  Nonetheless, faba bean sustained relatively high densities of aphidophaga (mainly lady beetles) during several weeks in late June.  Thereafter, bean aphid densities plummeted during an outbreak by an unidentified entomogenous fungus, which occurred following several days of wet weather .<P> Codling moth (<I>Cydia pomonella</I></B>) infested 22% of the apples in an orchard with a cover of bell beans, whereas a nearby clean cultivated organic orchard suffered a 45% fruit loss from this pest (Altieri et al., 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Often bell bean is mixed with other legumes and grasses for use as forage or silage (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  It may be grown in a mixture with fenugreek, vetch and oat.  Drill in beans 2-3 weeks earlier (McLeod, 1982).  Also, it may be sown in mixtures with common vetch, hairy vetch, and oat (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Bell bean matures from March to May (Peaceful Valley, 1988), 90-220 days after sowing (Duke, 1981).  According to Zapata et al.(1987), physiological maturity occurs 126 days after planting.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Uses include silage, hay, cover crop, green manure, vegetable and grain (McLeod, 1982); it makes excellent forage and silage (Duke, 1981; Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Because of its large taproot and stemmy growth, bell bean is a good cover crop for opening up heavy soils (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>This species is adapted to a cool, temperate climate (McLeod, 1982) and does not endure heat (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982).  High temperatures curtail seed production, and it generally cannot be grown where temperatures fluctuate rapidly (McLeod, 1982).  Though mentioned as resistant to frost injury, with hardier varieties surviving temperatures as low as 15 F (McLeod, 1982) or 14 degress F (-10 degrees C) without serious damage (Duke, 1981), it is more susceptible to low temperatures than the vetches (Miller, 1988). Madson (1951) considered that it showed moderate resistance to cold but was more susceptible to low temperatures and other adverse climatic conditions than the vetches, and in many areas it was not as dependable in performance.  Seedling growth and nodulation were both much slower at 10 degrees C than at 15 or 20 degrees C for faba bean cv 'Fiord'.  This may suggest problems with late sowing (Herdina and Silsbury, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>McKenry (Cantisano, pers. comm.) expected bell bean to host <I>Meloidogyne spp.</I></B><P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Bell bean should be sown in rows 75 cm (29.5 inches) apart; within rows, seeds should be 15 cm (5.9 inches) apart (Duke, 1981). McLeod (1982) suggestions are essentially identical: 6 inches spacing within the row; rows 30 inches apart.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Bell bean plant is stiff-stemmed and tall (Miller, 1988), stemmy, and with moderate to heavy density of growth (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Bell bean requires 42-63 days from sowing to peak bloom (Brinton, 1989).  Cv 'Fiord' flowered 60 days after sowing (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).  Cv 'Ipro' was sown on May 7 and produced extrafloral nectar from late June until the crop was plowed down in late July; flowering began on about June 19 (43 days to flower) (coastal Massachusetts) (Bugg and Ellis, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Varieties of bell beans with the highest biomass production are 'Ackerperle,' 'Herz Freya,' 'Aladin,' and 'Minnesota Horsebean' (Brinton, 1989).  Brinton (1989) says that bell beans produce 1,800 lb/a of dry matter, but this seems extremely low in light of Duke's (1981) figures of 4,870-8,060 kg/ha.  Faba bean (cv 'Fiord') at maturity contained 50% of total dry matter and 78% (90 kg/ha) of total nitrogen in the seed, 30 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).  Bugg et al. (unpublished data) reported that bell bean (no named cultivar) yielded 7.728+/-1.230 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  in dry above-ground biomass data, in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991.  When weeds were included with cover crop, above-ground dry biomass was 8.392+/-1.360.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Bell bean is not good at suppressing weeds and must be sown densely to avoid weed problems (Pears et al., 1989); cultivation is often required (Duke, 1981).  Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).  In bell bean (no named cultivar) plots, weed above-ground biomass (dry) was 0.664+/-0.308 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  (13.5% of the weed biomass in weedy control plots) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass Bugg et al. (unpublished data).  Vegetational cover data by bell bean 85.00+/-7.36 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Dua et al.  (1989) reported that cvv 'VH 82-1-1' (yellow seeds) and 'VH 82-1-2' (brown seeds) (both derived from cv 'VH 82-1') were sown in plots with differing soil salinities.  Both faba beans showed 100% germination up to salinities of ECe 9 dS/m.  At ECe 12 dS/m, germination was 50-60%.  Faba bean varieties had 50% reduction in yield at salinities of ECe 9.74 ('VH 82-1-1') and 9.86 dS/m ('VH 82-1-2'), but the threshold salinity was substantially higher for 'VH 82-1-2, suggesting that this statistic could be useful in evaluating germplasm in breeding programs for salinity tolerance.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Bell bean mean seed yield is 6,600 kg/ha in the U.S.  (Duke, 1981).  'Herz Freya' seed yield was 145-549 g/m2 (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).  Bell bean is notorious for unstable yields, which appear in part due to its susceptibility to drought (Herzog, 1989). In particulary, drought at flowering or pod formation can cause severe reduction of yields of faba bean (Koscielniak et al, 1989). In northern Germany, droughts during May and June cause low pod set of spring-sown faba bean (Herzog, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Bell bean can be sown at depths of 5-10 cm (about 2-4 inches) (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Large-seeded bell bean types can be sown with planters for lima beans; smaller-seeded types can be seeded using a common corn planter (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Bell bean seed should be harvested when lower pods are mature and upper pods fully formed.  If harvest is delayed until upper pods are mature, shattering is likely.  Cut on cloudy day or at night, and shock the next day.  A drop-rake reaper is better than an ordinary mower.  Smaller-seeded varieties can be threshed with no problem (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Inhalation of bell bean pollen or consumption of beans can lead to hemolytic anemia (favism), resulting from an inherited enzymatic deficiency occasionally found among Mediterranean peoples (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Like most legumes, bell bean is taprooted (Miller, 1988) and is mentioned as having a strong root system (Peaceful Valley, 1988). Nevertheless, it is a drought-intolerant plant (Husain et al., 19xx).  Roots of drought-stressed faba bean (cv 'Maris Bead') extended as far as 0.85 m in depth.  Average rooting depth was 0.70 m for drought-stressed and 0.52 m for irrigated plants.  As drought stress increases, faba bean shows the following responses: (1) rate of shoot height increase declines; (2) leaf area expansion decreases slightly; (3) root growth increases; (4) smaller leaves are produced; (5) leaves are shed; (6) shoot dry matter decreases. It has been thought that faba bean is most sensitive to drought stress during flowering because root growth ceases at this point for well-irrigated plants.  This is not the case with drought-stressed plants, i.e., root growth can continue. Thus, sensitivity to drought is more or less uniform throughout the development of the plant (Husain et al., 19xx).<P> Simulation modeling suggests that increased root growth was the most effective adaptation by which faba bean copes with drought stress at least until 21 days from maturity.  Breeding programs should probably emphasize the ability of plants to respond this way.  Deep tillage may also be beneficial in removing impediments to deep rooting (Reid, 1990).<P> From a depth of 60-90 cm in the soil stratum, white lupin (cv 'Eldo') root mass was 6 times that of faba bean (cv 'Herz Freya'). Overall root mass was 125 g/square meter for stands of white lupin and 86 g/square meter for faba bean (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).<P> Faba bean (cv Fiord) at maturity contained 50% of total dry matter and 78% (90 kg/ha) of total nitrogen in the seed, 30 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Winter oat, winter rape, winter peas, and spring faba beans as break crops greatly reduced the incidence of take-all of wheat (<I>Gaeumannomyces graminis</I></B>) (McEwen et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Bell bean has been regarded as a spring annual (Munoz & Graves, 1988) or as a winter annual (McLeod, 1982).  A literature review summarized by Buttery and Gibson (1990) indicated that substantial N-fixation continues up to plant maturity, whereas N-fixation by pea reaches a maximum before or at flowering and drops during pod formation.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Estimated amount of N fixed may range from 50-200 lb/acre, but bell bean is regarded as a low nitrogen fixer in southern California (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  In six weeks of growth, bell bean may fix up to 100 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982) and a total of up to 150 lb/acre on fertile soils (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Bell bean has a lower N content in above-ground biomass than most other legume cover crops.  Less than 100 lb N/ac was fixed by late March in 1987 in an experiment in Davis (Stivers & Shennan, pers. comm.). At plowdown, available N from bell bean can be estimated by multiplying harvested fresh weight of cover crop from a sixteen square feet (4 x 4 ft) sample plot by 10 (to estimate lbs of N/acre) (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Cv 'Wieselburger' at physiological maturity (126 days after planting) contained 209 kg N/ha, 79% (165 kg N/ha) of which came from fixation.  After the mid-podfilling stage, N-fixation dropped to nearly nothing.  If pods and and seeds were removed, faba bean residue would contribute approximately 27 kg/ha of N to the soil (Zapata et al.,1987).<P> Cv 'Fiord' began fixing nitrogen 53 days after sowing and accumulated 80% of its fixed nitrogen during grain filling; at maturity, it contained 50% of total dry matter and 78% (90 kg/ha) of total nitrogen in the seed, 30 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P> For cv 'Herz Freya,' N gain after seed harvest was 8 g/m2. Nitrogen fixation rates at different locations were approximately as follows during 1986: 60, 310, 180, 170, and 190 kg/ha2 (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).<P> A literature review indicates that N-fixation by pea reaches a maximum before or at flowering and drops during pod formation, whereas in faba bean substantial fixation continues up to plant maturity (Buttery and Gibson, 1990).  Bell bean cv 'Herz Freya' showed delayed nodulation where soil pH was low, whereas white lupin (cv 'Eldo') showed no decrease in N-fixation (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).  In Germany, winter crops of rape, barley, and Welsh ryegrass respectively accumulated in their above-ground structures 52.1, 36.2, and 22.9 kg N/ha following bell bean (cv 'Alfred') (Raderschall and Gebhardt, 1990).  In an experiment on rotational cash crops ("break crops") for wheat farmers, fertilizer N requirements were increased by 10 kg/ha following winter oat, decreased by 30 kg/ha following winter rape, winter peas, spring faba beans, or cultivated fallow, and decreased by 40 kg/ha following spring peas (McEwen et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>In Germany, winter crops of rape, barley, and Welsh ryegrass respectively accumulated in their above-ground structures 52.1, 36.2, and 22.9 kg N/ha following bell bean (cv 'Alfred') (Raderschall and Gebhardt, 1990).  In a greenhouse lysimeter study, winter wheat following fababeans yielded 8-25% more than following maize.  Using faba bean led to an increase in N turnover in the soil but not to a net increase in soil N. Nitrate leaching was higher following fababean (Huber et al., 1989).<P>

<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Germination is cryptocotylar (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>P and K are applied before or at seeding (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>No specific information is available on shade tolerance, but bell bean has been successfully used in George Kresa's organic walnut orchards (Winters, Yolo County, California), as well as those of Deseret Farms (West Sacramento, Yolo County, California) (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Duke's (1981) review suggested that soil moisture is more important than solar radiation or plant competition as regards seed yield.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>In bell bean culture, suitable preemergence herbicides include chlorpropham, diuron, fenuron, and simazine.  A suitable postemergence herbicide is dinoseb-acetate (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Duke's (1981) account suggested that the small-seeded varieties suitable as green manure can be sown using a common corn planter in rows 75 cm apart and at a depth of 5-10 cm, with intra-row spacing being 15 cm.  Small-seeded varieties are sown at 90-122 kg/ha. Well-drained, firm seedbeds, cool weather and moderate moisture are important.  Inoculation is not necessary in parts of England and Europe, where indigenous rhizobia suffice. No-till management reduces yields by 22%.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Per Duke's review (1981), bell bean can be grown without liming in most of the U.S.  Moisture requirement is greatest 9-12 weeks after sowing.  Bell bean is said to tolerate high and low pH, insects, slope, and virus.<P>

<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Viticulturists and enologists have long known of the fertilizer
value of grape pomace, the seeds and skins left over after grapes
have been processed in wineries.  In the scanty literature on
the subject, the value of pomace has been described primarily
in terms of its nitrogen contribution, with less emphasis on other
nutrients and characteristics.  A benefit of raw grape pomace
that has often been overlooked is the effect of the added organic
matter on soil structure, water penetration, and enhancement of
nutrient availability.  Composted grape pomace, however, provides
nutrients in a more concentrated and stable form than raw pomace.
<BR>
<P>
Depending on the variety, for every ton of hand-harvested grapes
crushed, 20 to 100 pounds of stems and 160 to 240 pounds of pomace
are produced.  The stems, which can be used in composted pomace,
are usually removed before crushing.  (Before air quality controls
were in place, much of the stem material was dried and burned.)
<BR>
<P>
Pomace is used in many ways.  Most of the waste is spread back
 into vineyards.  It is used as livestock feed, and in some areas
(primarily the Central Valley), it is burned in cogeneration plants
to produce energy.  Increasingly, winegrape waste is composted
for use in gardens, landscapes, vineyards, and other crops.<BR>

Large quantities of grape seeds are usually present in both pomace
and compost.  According to <B>Greg Young</B>, agronomist at Y
&amp; B Agricultural Services in Redwood Valley, many growers
purchasing compost question whether the material is &quot;finished&quot;
(i.e., has undergone the high-temperature thermophilic process).
 To alleviate grower concerns, and to make a better product, Young
blends the raw pomace with organic wastes from mushroom production
in a 1:2 ratio before composting.  Weed problems could occur in
landscaped areas if large numbers of grape seedlings germinate.
 Young notes that an application of raw pomace could result in
several dozen seedlings in a ten square foot area; a similar application
of finished compost of unblended pomace may yield only one or
two seedlings.<BR>

<H1>Field Day Showcases Sills' Sutter County Transition Farm</H1>
<P>
<I>by Dave Chaney, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Farmers developing systems of low or non-chemical agriculture
need both time and creativity.  This was the message at a Committee
for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) field day August 29, 1990 at<B>
Ed</B> and<B> Wynette Sills'</B> Pleasant Grove Farms in Sutter
County.  Since 1985, the Sills have been refining their organic
production practices on numerous crops.  They farm about 2,000
acres of almonds, rice, popcorn, oats, and vetch seed.  About
1,500 acres are certified by California Certified Organic Farmers
(CCOF).  The 50 individuals who attended the field day toured
the operation and heard Ed Sills and farm foreman <B>Peter Brostrom</B>
present some of their ideas and experiences with rice, corn, popcorn,
and almond production systems.
<H3>Almonds</H3>
<P>
Sills' goal with his 100 acres of almonds is to establish an orchard
that can take care of itself.  Key practices helping to achieve
this goal include planting trees on berms to improve drainage,
and maintaining a good clover cover crop on the orchard floor.
 Sills said the cover crop, mown periodically throughout the season,
not only helps improve soil quality by increasing organic matter
and water infiltration rates, but also helps to establish adequate
populations of beneficial organisms that can control pests like
the peach twig borer (PTB) and navel orangeworm.  <B>George Post</B>,
Ag Advisors, Yuba City, arrived early and scouted the orchard
for signs of PTB damage:  He could not find any.<BR>
<P>
A major challenge for Sills and Brostrom has been designing a
harvest system that is compatible with these floor management
practices.  Brostrom said that rather than using standard mechanical
harvesting and sweeping practices, the trees are knocked manually
with mallets.  The almonds fall onto a tarp and are rolled into
the middles to dry.  Nuts are then swept conventionally.  Managing
the cover crop presents some conflicts with these harvesting procedures,
but the kinks are being worked out slowly, he said.  Brostrom
said it remains to be seen whether the harvest method continues
to be economical as the trees grow and produce more nuts.
<H3>Popcorn, Rice</H3>
<P>
Rotations are the cornerstone of Sills' rice and popcorn production
systems.  Both crops are rotated in alternate years with seed
crops of vetch or oats and vetch.  In addition, a vetch cover
crop during the fall and winter improves soil physical properties
and supplies nitrogen for the following crop.  All crop residue
at Pleasant Grove Farms is incorporated into the soil; no straw
is burned.  This added residue increases organic matter and enhances
soil tilth, Sills said.<BR>
<P>
The greatest problem in Sills' rice and popcorn production systems
has been weed control.  There are a few weed species that have
adapted to the timing and environmental conditions created by
several years of a particular crop rotation.  Brostrom briefly
described some of the modifications they are making to address
these problems.  He said rice may be grown the year following
popcorn to control the broadleaf weeds that have appeared in the
corn and oat rotations.  They have also tried planting Sudan grass,
a summer cover crop, in a field that had been plagued with barnyard
grass, a warm season weed that builds up in corn.  The irrigation
of Sudan grass forced the barnyard grass to germinate.  Both the
Sudan grass crop and the barnyard grass were plowed down prior
to planting the fall cover crop.<BR>
<P>
Unusual weather conditions have added a complicating factor in
weed control. Cool weather in the spring of 1990 resulted in a
severe infestation of mustard and wild radish in newly planted
popcorn, Brostrom said.   Most growers would have disked in the
crop; Sills and Brostrom decided to use their cultivation skill,
and experience with various pieces of equipment to clean out the
weeds as soon as soil conditions allowed.  Two or three passes
with a Lilliston cultivator proved to be adequate and the popcorn
crop pulled through, Brostrom said.
<H3>On-Farm Residue Research</H3>
<P>
The field day also included reports from researchers working with
a 25-acre cooperative experiment partially supported by SAREP
at Pleasant Grove Farms<B>.  Stuart Pettygrove</B>, UC Davis land,
air and water resources department extension specialist;<B> Carl
Wick</B> and <B>Jack Williams</B>, Butte and Sutter county farm
advisors; and <B>Deng Jiayou</B>, UCD Davis land, air and water
resources researcher, are looking at rice-straw management in
a continuous rice-winter green manure rotation.  As they address
questions about burning vs. incorporating residue, their objectives
are to investigate:  1) The compatibility of straw incorporation
with vetch (winter green manure) production; 2) The effect of
green manure and rice straw incorporation on crop nitrogen response;
3) Soil tilth effects; and 4) Stem rot effects.<BR>
<P>
No conclusive results or data are available yet, but researchers
made several observations that may be relevant to rice farmers
considering using a cover crop:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Seed bed preparation is very important in establishing a good
cover crop.  Purple vetch broad-cast in late November on a rough
field containing a large amount of rice harvest residue resulted
in a non-uniform stand and very poor growth during the winter
months.  Rolling, flailing and/ or disking rice straw after harvest
may be necessary to ensure best vetch growth.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Soil pH and phosphorus content made a difference in how well
the cover crop grew.  These parameters should be matched prior
to planting to the cover crop species selected.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Data collected over the next two years will identify conflicts
between rice straw management strategies and the use of cover
crops as a source of nitrogen for rice production.
<H3>Controversy</H3>
<P>
In the meantime, rice straw burning continues to be a controversial
health and environmental issue in the Sacramento Valley.  Jack
Williams outlined some of the pros and cons in an afternoon workshop.
Rice straw incorporation has two other benefits besides the improvement
of air quality.  It adds valuable organic matter to the soil and,
by incorporating  the  straw,  some nutrients are returned to
the production system.  Williams said farmers continue to burn
rice straw in spite of these benefits because of its enormous
quantity, and the fact that it takes longer to break down when
it is incorporated into the soil.  Nutrients may also be tied
up during the process of straw decomposition. Additionally, there
are added time and energy costs related to incorporating residue,
and stem rot disease may overwinter on rice straw.<BR>
<P>
<B>Otis Wollan</B>, CSA executive director, reminded the audience
that the 1990-1991 burn plan recently approved by the California
State Air Resources Board for the Sacramento Valley Basinwide
Air Pollution Control District, allows fewer acres to be burned
on agricultural burn days.  Concurrently, strict &quot;no burn&quot;
regulations will be in force on days with poor air quality conditions,
further restricting regional rice growers.  Also, a rice burning
lawsuit is pending in which both the Air Resources Board are named,
Wollan said.  The outcome of this suit may establish even tighter
regulations on agricultural burning in the area.  Ed Sills put
the controversy into perspective by challenging the audience to
be prepared for the time when burning is not allowed.  Telling
the public that there is &quot;no problem&quot; simply won't work.
 Instead, Sills said, it is important to work on alternative residue
management strategies that address the restrictions rice growers
face.<BR>

Concerns</H1>

</I>
<P>
Natural and social scientists and farmers came together to share
various approaches to agricultural systems research at a conference
and workshops sponsored by the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program (SAREP), November 18-20, 1991.  <B>Bill
Liebhardt, SAREP director, </B>set the stage for the conference
with opening remarks that broadened the agricultural system to
include both environmental and social goals.  The systems approach,
said Liebhardt, &quot;is based on a theoretical construct which
suggests <I>relationships.  </I>We are beginning to see relationships
among production practices, environmental degradation, food safety,
health and safety of agricultural workers, the structure of agriculture,
and the viability of rural communities.  Researchers in universities
find that the approaches of 'reductionist science' are insufficient
to discuss the complex and dynamic issues involved in the world's
food production system.  A new, expanded way of seeing the world
and our activities in it is in order.&quot; Liebhardt said agricultural
and social science researchers, farmers, Extension personnel,
consumers, farmworkers and others in the food system all need
to become involved in discussing the problems and suggesting potential
solutions.<BR>
<P>
Dialogue among researchers of many disciplines and farmers was
a key part of the conference. A major focus was the complexity
of the farm environment, which is part biophysical, part socioeconomic.
 Speakers in the morning focused on farming systems research and
extension and other methods used in agricultural systems research.
Afternoon speakers discussed the environmental and social costs
of agricultural practices and current farm structure.  Panels
in both the morning and afternoon provided an opportunity for
farmers, researchers, policy analysts and extension personnel
to exchange views and interact with conference participants. 
The panel discussions demonstrated how agricultural research can
be enriched by the expertise and involvement of farmers and social
scientists.  Two days of workshops following the conference gave
participants the opportunity to apply actual data to farming systems
analysis or talk about environmental cost accounting in greater
depth.  The following discussion outlines major issues discussed
on the first day of the conference.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Farming Systems Research Methodologies</H3>
<P>
The morning session of the conference focused on farming systems
research, and featured one of the foremost practitioners and teachers
of systems analysis for on-farm agricultural research, <B>Peter
Hildebrand, </B>of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences
at the University of Florida.  Hildebrand discussed the history
and development of farming systems research and extension (FSRE)
activity worldwide, linking it to sustainable agriculture.  He
outlined the different components of FSRE, a farmer participatory
systems methodology for sustainable agriculture.  He discussed
diagnosing and selecting the problems, depicting alternative solutions,
designing on-farm evaluation procedures (on-farm trials), evaluating
results, disseminating acceptable solutions, making recommendations
and planning the next round of activities based on the results
of the current round.<BR>
<P>
Following Hildebrand's presentation, three researchers discussed
applications of the systems approach within the context of their
own field research projects.  <B>Steve Temple</B>, of the UC Davis
agronomy and range science department, described the methodology
used to compare conventional, low-input, and organic cropping
systems for the Sacramento Valley.  This multidisciplinary project
uses a classical replication model to make comparisons among different
treatments.  (See &quot;Farming Systems Comparison Field Day,&quot;
<I>Sustainable Agriculture News, Vol. 2, No.1, Fall 1989.)  </I>According
to Temple, changes in the cropping systems are evaluated through
intensive pest monitoring, soil sampling, crop growth and yield
measurements and cost/income analyses.  Models that emphasize
shared leadership and attention to the soil, rotations and the
long-term perspective are all important, Temple said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Laurie Drinkwater</B>, of<B> </B>the UC Davis vegetable crops
department, described a multidisciplinary on-farm project comparing
organic, transitional and conventional tomato production systems.
Multivariate statistics were used to analyze the soil, disease,
insect and management characteristics of 20 commercial farms over
a three-year period.  Intensive sampling allowed researchers to
determine how various ecological processes respond to different
amounts and types of inputs (e.g. organic vs. inorganic fertilizers).
 Principal components analysis was used to determine if broad
management effects on soil properties could be distinguished from
the unavoidable variability of parent soil type on the different
farms.  According to Drinkwater, management effects clearly overwhelmed
differences due to soil formation factors.  The soil characteristics
most affected by management were inorganic nitrogen pools, microbial
activity, pH, electrical conductivity and, to some extent, organic
carbon.  Coordinating data collection for different disciplines
has allowed researchers to examine the interaction of various
biological and management factors, for example, the effect of
the soil environment on severity of soil-borne disease.  Multivariate
analysis provides the opportunity to discriminate between site-specific
and management-related differences, said Drinkwater.<BR>
<P>
<B>Helene Murray, </B>director of the Oregon and Washington State
Universities/USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
(formerly LISA) program project, discussed the use of the <I>sondeo,
</I>a flexible on-farm interview technique used by an interdisciplinary
team.  A sondeo is one rapid reconnaissance tool that grew out
of farming systems research in Latin America and is intended to
provide a quick, preliminary sketch of farming systems.  It does
not use quantitative data as do more conventional research methods.
 Murray's research team surveyed innovative organic and conventional
farmers in western Oregon and Washington.  The goals of the sondeo
were to: 1) identify the factors influencing farm management among
innovative growers; 2) examine how innovative growers with farms
of different sizes and production methods are responding to these
challenges; 3) examine the usefulness of the sondeo as a research
and extension tool; and 4) identify collaborating growers for
longer-term project participation.  The sondeo team consisted
of researchers and extension personnel in horticulture, agronomy,
anthropology, plant pathology, plant ecology, weed science, entomology,
soil science, agricultural marketing and economics.  The sondeo
provided the team with the opportunity to work together and develop
a common understanding of research and extension priorities, she
said. Interviews were conducted with 25 farmers in a relaxed,
focus-group design.  The informal approach provided a good learning
and team-building environment for the sondeo team.  Results of
the sondeo show that the major off-farm influences on the producers
in the sondeo group relate to labor availability and public concern
over the use of pesticides.  Many of the growers, whether organic
or conventional, are responding to environmental and social pressures
and crop management problems with innovative management, Murray
said.  In fact, the sondeo revealed that the innovative growers
in this study have much in common and much to offer researchers
and other growers.
<H3>Working Relationships</H3>
<P>
Yolo County farmers <B>Tony Turkovich </B>and<B> Raul Adamchak
</B>participated in a panel with the morning speakers, where they
discussed working relationships in agricultural systems research.
Turkovich stressed the importance of regular and frequent meetings
between farmers and researchers so that practical problems can
be dealt with in a timely manner.  Adamchak suggested that even
more farmer-directed research is needed in order to address the
problems that farmers really face.  Farmer participation in research
has been sparse so far.  Helene Murray reiterated that farmers
have been key members of sondeo teams.  Methods to facilitate
good working relationships in the teams have included extensive
use of conference calls, and becoming aware of different learning
styles among team members.  Overall, participants and speakers
agreed that more farmer input in the design and implementation
of on-farm research should be encouraged.<BR>
<H3>Environmental &amp; Social Accounting</H3>
<P>
The afternoon session switched gears from farming systems research
to broader analyses of environmental and social costs of current
farming practices and structures.  <B>Paul Faeth, </B>a senior
associate in the Washington, D.C. World Resources Institute's
(WRI) economics and technology research program, began the discussion
with a presentation of WRI's study, <I>Paying the Farm Bill: Agricultural
Policy and the Transition to Sustainable Agriculture, </I>an examination
of U.S. agricultural policy that explicitly includes economic
measures of sustainability.  According to Faeth, farmers do not
include an accounting of sustainable resource use-such as soil
and water-in calculating net income.  Yet, by ignoring these costs,
farmers who do not use resource-conserving farming practices pay
the price through lost productivity.  Environmental costs will
eventually be borne by society.  Unfortunately, government agricultural
policies and support programs make things worse by discouraging
farmers from adopting resource-conserving strategies.  Since environmental
costs are ignored, farmers' income is overstated in the present,
leading to distorted choices among available farming practices.
 Faeth described how the WRI study used quantitative methods of
resource accounting for soil erosion to compare different farming
systems.  WRI researchers asked the question, <I>Which system
would farmers and society pick, given five different policy options?
<BR>
</I>
<P>
The data for the report came from long-term field trials in Pennsylvania
and Nebraska.  Soil erosion rates and long-term productivity losses
were analyzed for each site and technology using the USDA Erosion
Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) Model.  The soil erosion
estimates take into account recreational losses, harbor dredging,
municipal water treatment, steam power cooling, flooding, navigation,
roadside ditch clearing, and irrigation.  Output from this model
was then used with USDA estimates of regional damages caused by
soil erosion to estimate the off-farm costs associated with conventional
and alternative crop rotations.  Results show that where erosion-prone
soils are causing environmental damage on and off the farm, resource-conserving
production systems are economically superior.  Farmers who adopt
these resource-conserving systems may suffer some short-term income
loss during the transition phase, but are likely to make long-term
financial gains by improving their land's productivity.  (See
Faeth et al., <I>Components, No.2, Vol.3, Summer 1991.)<BR>
</I>
<H3>Farm Scale</H3>
<P>
<B>Dean MacCannell</B> and<B> Isao Fujimoto, </B>researchers in
the Applied Behavioral Science Department at UC Davis, focused
on the social impacts of agriculture as they relate to the structure
of agriculture (scale, technology choices and control of resources),
community development and sustainability.  MacCannell reported
on the comparative community studies he and Fujimoto have worked
on that tested a hypothesis put forth in 1944 by <B>Walter Goldschmidt,</B>
a University of California, Los Angeles anthropologist.  In an
ethnographic comparison of Arvin and Dinuba, two towns in the
Central Valley, Goldschmidt attributed differences in the quality
of life to the structure of the surrounding agriculture.  He concluded
that smaller-scale family-owned and operated farms are crucial
to the health and well-being of rural communities. MacCannell's
work through the UC Davis Macrosocial Accounting Project was to
improve Goldschmidt's research design by doing macro-comparisons
of 80 California Central Valley communities or 100 sunbelt counties.
 This research found that Goldschmidt's hypothesis withstood more
rigorous testing.  According to MacCannell, the relationship can
be described by an &quot;inverted J&quot; curve, with quality
of life in rural communities on the vertical axis and farm size
on the horizontal axis.  Quality of life improves as farm size
increases until about 300 acres. Then, said MacCannell, quality
of life decreases significantly as farm size increases further.
 In a similar vein, Fujimoto's study looked at the structure and
location of communities in relation to the control of water. 
His recent work examined the role of coalition building in bringing
about sustainable development in agriculture and communities in
the Central Valley.<BR>
<H3>Ag Coalition</H3>
<P>
<B>Larry Yee, </B>Ventura County UC Cooperative Extension director<B>,
</B>followed Fujimoto's discussion with a real-life example of
coalition building in Ventura County, the Ventura County Food
Safety Study Group.  Galvanized by the &quot;Alar scare&quot;
in 1989, Larry Yee and <B>Tim Wallace</B>, an Extension economist
in agriculture and resource economics at UC Berkeley, formed a
coalition of diverse individuals including environmentalists,
agricultural leaders, the League of Women Voters, food retailers,
farm labor and consumer advocates and chemical testing labs. The
coalition was created to explore ways to improve the credibility
of the food system in Ventura County, and in the long run, to
reduce the use of pesticides.  Yee said it was a practical, grassroots
attempt to involve people in the community in discussion and decision-making
about their food system.  The process was an open, flexible one
in which the group set the agenda and &quot;owned the process,&quot;
he noted.  Through constant input and feedback from all members
of the group, mutual education was fostered, issues were clarified,
and communication and problem solving improved, Yee said.  Most
significantly, trust has been built among representatives of diverse
and sometimes antagonistic interests.  Currently, the Food Safety
Study Group is exploring ways to expand the process to the larger
community.<BR>
<H3>Social Science &amp; Farming</H3>
<P>
A second panel, including all of the afternoon speakers, and <B>Mas<FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT>Masumoto</B>, a Del Rey farmer with California Clean Growers,
reflected on how the work of social scientists might complement
or enrich farming systems research.  Faeth commented on the need
to improve our economic analysis of the &quot;factors of production,&quot;
considering natural resources as assets in an explicit way in
figuring net farm income.  Farming systems research should include
a more complete notion of economic accountability.  He also noted
that if WRI's analysis is taken seriously by policymakers, it
should strengthen the case for devoting more federal research
monies to sustainable agriculture.<BR>
<P>
MacCannell suggested that whole farm case studies could benefit
from the expertise of anthropologists or ethnographers.  He also
noted that a neglected and potentially fruitful area of research
would consider how &quot;economies of scale,&quot; studied from
an economic perspective, mesh with what is known about social
costs of large-scale agriculture.  Fujimoto went even further
to suggest the need to expand ways of measuring the impacts of
agricultural practices on rural communities.  He noted that commonly
used quantitative economic models describe impacts in dollars
and cents.  Fujimoto suggested the need to develop more creative
ways to measure the qualitative impacts of agriculture on communities.
 Masumoto concluded there is a need to recapture local knowledge
about farming systems, from farmers and from communities.  He
said it is important to emphasize that farmers, consumers, researchers,
farmworkers and policymakers are a community, and thus have a
need to speak the language of interdisciplinary work.<BR>

<P>
It's often said that the role of the university is to convey scientific
information to farmers and consumers. But we rarely question what
is meant by &quot;scientific information,&quot; and whether the
information that we convey is most relevant to the people we serve.
<BR>

<P>
To many of us, &quot;scientific&quot; means &quot;based on replicated
research, &quot;where comparisons are made of experimental treatments
applied in a systematic manner to different animals or plots of
land. Well-accepted experimental designs for assigning treatments
and analyzing results help to ensure that results can be accurately
judged to be due to treatments versus chance. These methods have
been very successful, and we highly recommend that farmers use
them in their own on-farm trials [see Auburn and Bugg, &quot;On-Farm
Research and the Transition,&quot; <I>Sustainable Agriculture
News</I> 3(2), Winter 1991], rather than dismissing them as irrelevant
&quot;number crunching.&quot; <BR>

<P>
There is, however, a broader view of scientific method that comes
from the social sciences, where experimental manipulation of people
is often not as easy as it is with plots of land. Systematic observations
without manipulation, and comparisons of treatments that are only
partially under the experimenter's control, are a part of &quot;quasi-experimental
designs&quot; that have their own methods for analysis. A book
on these methods by two prominent social scientists (Cook, T.D.
and D.T. Campbell, <I>Quasi-Experimentation: Design and Analysis
Issues for Field Settings</I>, 1979, Rand-McNally College Publ.
Co.) includes a thoughtful discussion of how both experimental
and quasi experimental designs can help, but not guarantee, that
our observations are free of bias and error. <BR>

<P>
In reality, we gain our knowledge of the world through a continuum
of methods ranging from observation to experimental manipulation.
If we restrict ourselves to using information derived from the
latter only, we are giving the public a fraction of what they
need. Education based on &quot;decision cases&quot; has long been
popular in business and law schools. It is just now being explored
by agricultural schools, most notably at the University of Minnesota
(see M.J. Stanford et al., <I>Decision Cases for Agriculture</I>,
1992, College of Agriculture, Univ. Minnesota, St. Paul). <B>Ann
Drescher Mayse,</B> SAREP analyst, has begun exploring the perception
of case studies by farmers and farm advisors in California (see
p. 6). <BR>

<P>
The Sustainable Agriculture Network, a national cooperative effort
to make information available has declared &quot;experiential&quot;
information (that which comes from practical experience rather
than scientific experiments) to be an equally valuable, although
different, data source on sustainable agriculture. It makes many
of us uncomfortable because there are relatively few accepted
methods for collecting and sharing it, compared to experimental
knowledge. Information from a poorly-designed and executed experiment
is just as worthless as unsubstantiated anecdotal information,
but we have a long-standing system for conducting and reporting
the former that helps us identify research that is, or is not,
credible or useful. Can we develop a similar system for collecting
and sharing experiential information that will help us do the
same with the great wealth of experience that farmers and other
citizens are developing from their day-to-day observations?-<I>Jill

<P>
California farmers and ranchers continue to feel the results of
Mother Nature's latest one-two punch:  the freeze and the drought.
 Fiscal crises continue to affect rural counties' survivability.
<BR>
<P>
With so many issues out of their hands, what can farmers do to
make their own survival easier?<BR>
<P>
Reducing off-farm inputs is a theme we've addressed before.  California
is in a major transition. By planning for this and taking action
farmers help set their own agenda.  Increasing their reliance
on internal resources and their own management skills will help.
 Farmers who take advantage of information the university system
has to offer may be less damaged by the drought.  (See<B> Drought
&amp; Sustainability</B> this page.)<BR>
<P>
Good basic soil management and preventative pest management is
a starting point.  Soil management may involve the use of biological
material including green manures, manure, and compost.  Many farmers
may be able to avoid purchasing much of the nitrogen they thought
they needed just by using what is still in their soil.  Due to
the lack of rain, most nitrogen in the soil last fall is probably
still there.  A simple soil nitrate test can confirm this.  Other
on-farm sources could include irrigation water and legumes in
the rotation.  If manures or composts are used as soil amendments,
they also contribute nitrogen.<BR>
<P>
Creating biological diversity in farms and ranches can help reduce
pest problems.  Grass and legume covers do this by providing habitat
for beneficials.  Diversified farms offer growers some protection
from crop-specific freezes or droughts.  <B>Mas Masumoto</B> notes
in an article on farms in transition (see page 10) that the chaos
of changing water patterns can actually inspire creativity and
innovation on the farm.  Philosophical shifts can help farmers
make decisions that may save their farms' economic viability.

Research in Rural Sociology and Development, Volume 6:67-93. 
1995<BR>

<P>
This paper critically evaluates the recent developments of sustainable
agriculture at the rural/urban fringe in the Northeast U.S. From
the  authors' perspective, sustainability relates mainly to diversification
of production, pursuit of new markets and a greater local and
regional self-sufficiency in food production. The authors present
specific agricultural trends for the Northeast in the 1980s and
then report how farmland preservation planners see these changes
playing out in the future. The authors identify some problems
that must be dealt with if agriculture  is to survive in the Northeast
and policies that have already been implemented to address these
problems. They conclude with an assessment of the possibilities
for sustainable agriculture in the Northeast's rural/urban fringe.
<H3>Background</H3>

<P>
In response to the farm crisis of the 1980s, many farmers across
the nation have begun developing alternative production systems
and farm enterprises that are less dependent on the highly specialized,
 government-supported agricultural system.  At one level, these
alternative systems are more risky than conventional operations,
but a greater diversity of products that take advantage of market
niches and that offer premium prices helps compensate for the
risks.  Such strategies have been particularly successful in rural/urban
fringe areas where producers have direct access to urban consumers.
<P>
As a result of the successful adaptation of farmers to these new
markets  and the stabilization of the farmland base near some
cities, say the authors, agriculture at the rural/urban fringe
is becoming a dynamic sector of the economy, and in fact, may
represent a &quot;harbinger of some types of activity that will
inhabit these areas in the future&quot; (p. 70).  According to
the authors, the literature on rural/urban fringe agriculture
consistently attributes this dynamism to the spread of residential
 development into agricultural areas that emerged in the 1970s.
 Although this phenomenon has created well-documented problems,
including cropland losses, complaints about farming practices
and loss of farm support businesses, residents also value local
agriculture as part of the ambiance they seek.
<P>
Farms that have flourished in rural/urban fringe areas have done
so largely because they cater to the preferences of nearby residents.
 They  tend to be more specialized in producing high value crops,
sell more products directly to consumers, are smaller and make
more efficient use of resources. Policies to support these farms
have been adopted throughout the Northeast, including right-to-farm
ordinances, preferential assessment of farmland, agricultural
zoning and purchase of land or development rights.  The authors
of this paper have two primary concerns:  1) What type of agriculture
do these policies aim to preserve?  And 2) Will they be successful
at  sustaining agriculture in the Northeast urban fringe areas
for years to come?
<H3>Methods</H3>

<P>
To address these questions, the authors used two main data sources.
First, changes in northeastern agriculture were observed using
county Census of Agriculture data for 1978 and 1987, the most
recent information  available.  Metropolitan counties in 11 states
(Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont)
were identified using the U.S. Census Bureau designation for 
1983. The second data source was a survey of professional planners
currently involved in land use planning in the Northeast's rural/urban
fringe.  A mail survey of 259 planners working in  the public
sector, in private non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and as
consultants to public and private agencies, was conducted in the
latter half of 1992.  The 210 responses returned represented an
81 percent response rate.  In addition to fixed-response questions
on local planning issues, respondents were asked two open-ended
questions about the future of agriculture in their area. These
views, along with salient agricultural  changes and local farm
preservation policies were then evaluated in terms of four criteria
for sustainability:  emphasis on production for local markets,
crop diversity, maintenance of small communities, and the adoption
of farming methods that minimize the disruption of ecosystems.
<H3>Agricultural Trends in the Northeast's Rural/Urban Fringe
</H3>

<P>
Census data showed that farm numbers and farmland acres in the
rural/urban  fringe remained relatively stable in the 1980s, although
small farms increased and middle-sized farms declined.  The largest
average percentage declines were in poultry and dairy farms. 
The largest proportional increase was in farms specializing in
animal products.  Data and interviews suggested horse farms were
the main source of this increase. The authors suggest that the
rural/urban fringe may be changing from a locus of  production
to one of leisure pursuits.  In contrast, numbers of farms specializing
in field crops, horticultural specialties and vegetables remained
the same.
<H3>Planners' Visions</H3>

<P>
Survey results found that planners expressed positive opinions
about the prospects for agriculture in their areas.  The minority
that had negative assessments were mostly from the New England
states and felt that urban expansion and farmland conversion would
continue and drive up the costs of production, making small-scale
production unprofitable.  These planners held out some hope for
pasture-based animal production on marginal lands.
<P>
Those expressing the majority opinion emphasized the importance
of market opportunities associated with access to urban markets.
 They felt that local agriculture was competitive with other regions,
given a situation where producers are treated equally in terms
of various government  subsidies.  Most still admitted that farms
directly on the urban periphery would be converted to other uses,
yet they also saw urban development creating new market opportunities
for produce and nursery products through local outlets.  These
views run counter to dominant development trends in the U.S. which
have led to increasing regional concentration.
<P>
Planners do not envision a type of agriculture at the rural/urban
fringe  that will be oriented toward self-sufficiency in food,
but that will exploit diverse, lucrative specialty niche markets
in the region.  These markets include a variety of nontraditional
commodities such as the growing ethnic demand for sheep and goat
products and &quot;boutique&quot; farm specialties, as well as
farm involvement in services such as tourism, recreation and education.
These activities are expected to become an important income  source
and contribute to the economic development of the region.
<P>
Planners expect to meet regional food demands in two ways: 1)
through the strong rise in direct marketing to consumers (e.g.,
farm stands, U-pick operations, local farmers' markets and 2)
by supplying larger regional markets in nearby large urban centers.
On the other hand, planners disagree about the likely future structure
of agriculture in the region.  About half expect farm consolidation
and the other half feel deconcentration will occur.  In both cases,
according to the authors, we can expect more diversification on
farms as well as a more diverse farm sector within local areas.
<P>
Although planners devoted much attention to the economic aspects
of local agriculture, very little concern was directed toward
the environment.  Few thought problems such as soil erosion, pesticide
drift, or water pollution would be problems in the future and
that local agriculture, in general, is environmentally friendly
and a preferred use of the land.  They expected that local agriculture
will be more important as dwindling energy supplies make local
food sources more attractive to urban populations.
<P>
Even though the Northeast rural/urban fringe agriculture may be
important for meeting future food needs, planners identified several
problems that threaten farm survival. It is most threatened by
development pressures and farmland conversion to non-farm uses.
 Related problems include the &quot;parcelization&quot; of farmland
as a result of poor zoning regulations, and the decreased opportunities
for young people to enter farming because they can't compete with
developers for valuable land.
<P>
There are some policies to preserve agriculture in rural/urban
fringe areas and these are strongly supported by planners.  Preferential
farmland tax assessment is the most common measure found in all
states of the region.  Purchase of development rights (PDR) programs
were also fairly common (in 60 percent of the counties studied)
and were enthusiastically endorsed by planners.  Under PDR programs,
farmers voluntarily sell their development rights and receive
payment for development restrictions through public funds.  Although
popular, PDR programs are expensive and the demand for them often
exceeds the funds available.  Other policies have also been enacted
to preserve farm enterprises, such as zoning for roadside stands,
farmers' markets, housing for farm labor, etc.  Planners indicate
these policies are not as important as farmland preservation.
 They view  farmland preservation as more of &quot;a means to
promote an orderly and efficient pattern of growth&quot; vs. &quot;a
limit to overall growth.&quot;  
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
From this evidence, the authors conclude that farm enterprises
must increasingly orient their production toward alternative markets.
 Farmers  in rural/urban fringe areas are successfully taking
advantage of the demand for local, specialty food and farm products.
 The dominant sentiment from planners is that local agriculture
is desirable and should be encouraged through local policies.
 This type of agriculture is consistent with the bioregional approach
articulated by environmentalists and others, which emphasizes
the consumption of food produced locally within a particular region.
 However, the capacity of local agriculture to sustain the natural
resource base in these areas is limited in scope.  Planners expect
an emphasis on high value commodity production, marketed mainly
to affluent consumers.  Development pressures will continue to
pose serious threats to farmland preservation.  Given this scenario,
the authors suggest that efforts are needed to intervene in land
markets and to enhance the  viability of existing farms.  The
effectiveness of these efforts hinges on three critical areas
of public support: 1) the demand for regional farm products and
services, 2) farmland protection, and 3) continued willingness
of the public to provide financial support for acquisition of
farmland. Although a strong base of support for rural/urban fringe
agriculture and its products and services has been established,
this trend will need to  continue lest farmland preservation become
narrowly defined as open space protection.  The extent of the
public's investment and sacrifice in an era of tight budgets will
ultimately determine the future of agriculture in the northeast.

UC SAREP received a $25,000 contract from the State of California
Water Resources Control Board for work demonstrating the role
of cover crops in improving water quality. In the next 16 months,
SAREP staff members will develop a manual based on the program's
rapidly expanding database of cover crop characteristics. Information
gathered from two demonstration projects in the Central Valley
will also be included in the manual, which is receiving additional
funding from a USDA Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA) Program
grant (see LISA, page 2.)<BR>
<P>
<B>Terry Prichard</B>, a UC Davis water management extension specialist,
and <B>Lonnie Hendricks</B>, a Merced County farm advisor are
coordinating a demonstration project comparing different grasses
in an almond orchard for their ability to improve water infiltration
and reduce the need for herbicides. Tulare County farm advisors
<B>Neil O'Connell</B> and <B>Michelle LeStrange</B> and Extension
Specialist <B>John Pehrson</B> are examining winter legumes for

<H1>Building Support for Sustainable Ag Policy</H1>

<P>
<I>by Kai Siedenburg, California SAWG</I>
<P>
<I> <BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Editor's Note: <B>Kai Siedenburg</B> is the coordinator of
the newly established California sustainable Agriculture Working
Group (CaSAWG). <BR>
</I>
<P>
The California Sustainable Agriculture working Group (SAWG) is
a new group dedicated to promoting sustainable agriculture through
policy work. California SAWG's key goals are to build alliances
among a wide spectrum of groups concerned with food and farming,
to broaden public participation in agriculture policy development,
and to win passage of sustainable agriculture policies, particularly
in the 1995 Farm Bill. SAWGs have already been organized in the
Midwest, the Northeast, the South and parts of the Western region
of the U.S. <BR>

<P>
California SAWG's current emphasis is coordinating the state's
participation in the National Dialogue for Sustainable Agriculture,
an unprecedented organizing effort to incorporate sustainable
agriculture policies into the 1995 Farm Bill. National Dialogue
participants are organizing local meetings throughout the nation
to generate practical policy options and build a strong coalition
to support their implementation. <BR>

<P>
In addition to work on the 1995 Farm Bill the California SAWG
can provide a forum for other agriculture policy work. Pending
additional funding, the group hopes to organize a statewide meeting
in 1994 to coordinate work on the Farm Bill and set directions
for future work. California SAWG is currently supported by a start-up
grant from the California Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture
(CASA). <BR>

<P>
California SAWG is committed to working with diverse participants
to identify common ground, including farmers, sustainable and
organic farm groups, labor advocates, environmentalists, consumer
groups, and others. Opportunities for involvement include inviting
SAWG representatives or publicizing SAWG work at local meetings,
helping write or commenting on policy options and draft legislation,
cultivating support from elected officials (particularly Congressional
agriculture committee members), publishing articles in newsletters
or generating press coverage, and issuing action alerts and lobbying
for specific policies and appropriations. For more information,
contact Kai Siedenburg, California SAWG, P.O. Box 1599, Santa
Cruz, CA 95061; (408) 458-5304.<BR>

<H1>Scarcity and Abundance</H1>

<FONT SIZE=+3>w</FONT>e have all experienced the feelings of scarcity 
and abundance. I experienced scarcity the first time I was in a sail boat. I 
was sailing in a small boat and went about two miles up a lake with a good 
strong breeze at my back. When I got to the end of the lake, I suddenly 
realized I could not return because I could not sail into the wind the way I 
had gone up the lake. After some struggle and thinking about my 
predicament, I experimented with doing things differently and in about 10 
minutes I was headed back down the lake. It was not straight and direct but 
rather a zig zag tacking course which took longer, but I made it back home. 
In this example I experienced both an abundance of wind in one direction 
and scarcity of wind in the other direction. I needed to change my behavior 
to make a round trip if I was going to use the boat as it was meant to be used. 
<BR>
 Both individuals and organizations run into scarcity and abundance. How 
can we adapt and adjust to these changes in resource availability? The 
survival of an organization, and indeed, California in the long-term will most 
likely be determined by what we do when times are hard. It is during those 
times that we need to change our behavior. Civilizations that have not made 
adjustments, such as those that ignored soil salinity, no longer exist. <P>

Due to the state of California's fiscal problems, the University of California 
suffered severe budgetary shortfalls in the 1990s. The legislature cut UC's 
allocation by approximately 20 percent of the 1989-90 budget through 1994-
95. SAREP's response to scarcity might have been to scale back our efforts 
in proportion to our declining budget: lay off staff, cancel some kinds of 
grants, etc. Instead, we tried another tack: We maintained all of our 
competitive grant categories (although the average size of individual awards 
was reduced) and our staff looked for opportunities to form partnerships with 
other individuals and organizations inside and outside the university. One of 
these partnerships, with the Community Alliance with Family Farmers 
Foundation, UC Cooperative Extension Merced County Farm Advisor 
Lonnie Hendricks and others, was the Biologically Integrated Orchard 
Systems (BIOS) project for almonds which has since expanded into walnuts 
and other crops.  This program started with the idea that there are many 
players who can come to the table with ideas about how to solve agricultural 
problems. The heart of this work involves participatory management teams 
of farmers, consultants, UC farm advisors and researchers, and independent 
pest control advisers. Approximately 20 farmers per area work with the 
participatory teams to develop whole systems on their farms that are more 
biologically based and therefore need fewer chemicals. In 1994 the state 
legislature passed AB 3383 which authorized a new program of competitive 
grants for projects modeled after BIOS. In this new Biologically Integrated 
Farming Systems (BIFS) program, we are supporting two collaborative 
projects in grapes and row crops (see <A HREF=" 
http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/sarep/newsltr/v7n4/sa-6.htm">Sustainable 
Agriculture Vol. 7, No. 4, "SAREP Awards BIFS Grants to San Joaquin 
Valley Growers, Scientists"</A>)-with more to come. Similar projects are 
underway around the state, with funding from US-EPA, California 
Department of Pesticide Regulation and private foundations. Instead of 
shrinking programs with a mentality of scarcity, we have expanding 
programs with new partners and new sources of funding.
<BR>
In this issue of Sustainable Agriculture (page 3, "Marin Coastal Watershed 
Project: Part 2") we present another example of collaborative work used to 
adapt to "changing winds." Ellen Rilla, UC Cooperative Extension director 
in Marin and Sonoma counties and Stephanie Larson, UC Cooperative 
Extension livestock and range management advisor, Marin/Sonoma counties 
have written about the Marin Coastal Watershed Enhancement Project. This 
collaborative project evolved from elements similar to those faced in BIOS 
and BIFS projects-public perceptions of agricultural practices and resultant 
criticism of farmers, threats of an increasingly restrictive regulatory 
environment in agriculture (in this case related to nonpoint source pollution 
or NSP), and a lack of understanding of practices that contribute to this 
problem. The issues were and are potentially contentious and yet this group 
of people, including UC Cooperative Extension personnel, farmers and 
ranchers, natural resources agencies, and environmental groups came 
together to work out solutions that will benefit individuals and the larger 
communities. They coordinated information on all aspects of NSP and 
encouraged farmers and ranchers to take a proactive stance in planning for 
NSP regulations. The Marin project is an example of how cooperation and 
creativity can bridge the gap that exists between a large and complex job to 
be done, and the limited resources any single organization can bring to the 
table.

<H1>First Organic Cotton Conference</H1>
<P>
<I>(Editor's note: This article was written by Brian Baker, with
California Certified Organic Farmers.  It appeared in the CCOF
Statewide Newsletter, Spring 1992, Volume 9, Number 2, and was
adapted for Sustainable Agriculture by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff6.html">David Chaney</A>, UC SAREP.)
<BR>
</I>
<P>
The first ever organic cotton conference was held in Visalia on
March 11, 1992.  The conference was organized by the California
Institute for Rural Studies with support from UC SAREP, California
Certified Organic Farmers, the Committee for Sustainable Agriculture
and several other organizations and companies.  It was attended
by more than 250 people from every facet of the cotton and textile
industry, including approximately 75 growers and 45 pest control
advisers. The agenda covered all aspects of growing, processing
and marketing organic cotton.<BR>
<P>
Representatives from clothing and textile manufacturers at the
conference said that there is an increasing demand for organic
cotton, with significant premiums going to the few growers who
now raise the crop.  In California, that includes two San Joaquin
Valley producers certified through California Certified Organic
Farmers (CCOF), Cal-Organics and <B>Sally Fox</B>, both in the
Kern chapter.  Several other CCOF growers have expressed interest
in growing cotton on CCOF certified acreage in 1992.  In addition
to the limited acreage in California, four Texas growers produced
organic cotton certified by the Texas Department of Agriculture
on 600 acres last year.
<H3><B>Growing Concerns</B></H3>
<P>
What are the chances for increasing the acreage of organic cotton
in California?  The answer to that question depends on how well
growers can alter their conventional production practices to suit
the requirements of organic certification and the quality standards
of ginners and textile manufacturers.  Some of the key areas discussed
at the conference are summarized here.<BR>
<P>
<B>Soil fertility</B>. While cotton is a relatively heavy feeder
when compared with other field crops, the nutrient requirements
are not as high as most vegetables.  Cotton could present a useful
rotation crop for organic growers who also produce canning tomatoes,
vegetables, grains and forage crops in the San Joaquin Valley.
 Presenters noted that a fertility program based on compost, manure,
and the right cover crops could adequately meet the nutrient requirements
of cotton.<BR>
<P>
<B>Pest management</B>. Cotton accounts for more pesticide use
than any other crop in California.  The principal insect pest
in the San Joaquin Valley is the lygus bug.  Lygus can be managed
by rotation of non-host crops and by strip-cropping with a preferred
host, such as alfalfa, which traps the lygus.  Other pests include
mites and caterpillars such as the beet armyworm and cotton bollworm
<I>(Heliothis zea).  </I>These worms can be managed with beneficial
insects and <I>Bacillus thuringiensis </I>(Bt).<BR>
<P>
Pest pressure is considerably greater in the Imperial and Palo
Verde valleys.  Pink bollworm is a significant problem in these
areas, but has been mitigated somewhat by the mandatory short
season that breaks the insect's reproductive cycle.  Another serious
cotton pest in the Imperial Valley is the sweet potato whitefly.
<BR>
<P>
Once established, cotton can hold its own against weeds.  A program
of rotation, preirrigation and timely cultivation can keep hand
labor costs to a minimum.  Mechanical harvesting requires relatively
weed-free fields.<BR>
<P>
<B>Defoliation</B>.  The biggest question for California organic
cotton producers is how to defoliate the crop prior to harvest.
 Under conventional production practices, this is accomplished
using synthetic chemicals.  In fact, almost half of the pesticides
used on cotton in California are defoliants (two of the three
currently registered in California are on the SB 950 list for
possible suspension).<BR>
<P>
Defoliants serve three purposes: 1) they make mechanical harvest
easier by eliminating the leaves that may jam the picker; 2) they
prevent the staining of the cotton by chlorophyll that would still
be in live leaves; 3) they reduce the moisture content of the
seed cotton by stopping evapotranspiration in the canopy.<BR>
<P>
While it is possible to mechanically harvest cotton without defoliation,
it is more difficult than with defoliation and can reduce quality
by several grades.  The presence of foliage results in a higher
moisture content of the harvested cotton, which in turn requires
greater care and attention during the drying and ginning process.
 Moreover, as the cotton is stacked into large &quot;modules&quot;
in the field, it may actually begin to compost if the cotton is
too moist.  (The modules are a convenient way to transport and
store seed cotton before it is ginned.)  In some cases the decomposition
process may produce temperatures in excess of 130 F.  Additionally,
San Joaquin Valley growers are required to plow down their crop
residue by December 20 for pink bollworm control.  This date necessitates
early defoliation in order to complete harvest and land preparation.
 Under these circumstances, natural defoliation by frost is not
a possibility.<BR>
<P>
CCOF growers have used several different naturally occurring materials
to defoliate, with little success.  Other possibilities explored
included a machine developed in the 1960s that defoliated cotton
with heat from propane gas.  While the defoliation and quality
were comparable with chemical defoliation, the cost of the machine
and fuel made thermal defoliation uncompetitive. Variations of
this machine may be economically feasible if it is linked to the
power take-off or electrical system of the tractor.<BR>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to prepare a crop for harvest is to manage
the nutrients and water so that the cotton plant will naturally
stop growing.  Cotton harvested without defoliants may have a
small amount of green staining, and should be ginned immediately
after harvest.  If the cotton could be picked into trailers, rather
than built into modules, excessive moisture and decomposition
could be  reduced.<BR>
<P>
The steps in processing from the gin to finishing are largely
mechanical.  A few production aids may be used in spinning and
weaving.  Finishing and dying are mostly chemical processes. 
These stages of the manufacturing process will require the most
attention if apparel manufacturers want to label finished products
&quot;organic&quot;<BR>

<P>
What are the consequences of adopting more &quot;environmentally
sensitive&quot; farming practices? Does the farmer change along
with the farm?   Can changes be categorized or documented? SAREP
is funding a two-year project that hopes to systematically document
what occurs after a farm makes the transition by monitoring production
systems at five farms in Tulare and Fresno counties.  Called &quot;Encouraging
Profiles,&quot; the project is examining habitats, biocontrol
and farmer experiences at the farms of <B>David Mas Masumoto</B>
in Del Rey, <B>Paul</B> <B>Buxman</B> in Dinuba, <B>Richard</B>
and <B>Karen Peterson</B> in Kingsburg, <B>Rod Riffel</B> in Parlier,
and <B>Fred Smeds</B> in Reedley.<BR>
<P>
The project is assessing the effects of biocontrol practices (use
of beneficial insects to control insect pests) in relation to
cover crop choices, natural fertilization, and IPM systems on
grape and stone fruit farms.  The baseline survey is being conducted
by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and farmers headed
by Ventura County entomologist <B>Everett Dietrick,</B> UC researcher<B>
Harry Shorey</B> and farmer Mas Masumoto.
<H3>Technical Findings</H3>
<P>
Harry Shorey, entomologist, UC Kearney Agricultural Center in
Parlier, has surveyed insects and arthropods on the five farms.
 He noted that beneficial arthropods were ten to 100 times higher
in the cover crops per square foot than in nearby vines or trees.
 In a project report Shorey wrote that this was probably caused
by the arthropods' response to plentiful food sources which were
much higher in species diversity and numbers in the cover crop
than in the vines and trees.  Shorey noted that a comparison of
data from farms with cover crops showed that they had a significant
reduction in the number of variegated leaf hoppers, a serious
pest in the area, compared to nearby farms without cover crops.
 His initial survey of species and numbers of pests and beneficials
in the vines, trees and cover crops will be used as a baseline
for further characterization of life on farms in various states
of transition.<BR>
<P>
Everett Dietrick noted in a report that the project reinforces
his experience with cover crops and mulch management, particularly
periodic alternate mowing.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Each time half of the cover crop strips are mowed, the other
strips are left to regrow and attract the insects (pests and beneficials)
from the cut area,&quot; Dietrick said. &quot;This repeated removal
reduces the food supply of plant-feeding insects.  Many move into
the adjacent uncut area instead of dispersing.  This favors beneficials
finding their prey,&quot; he added.<BR>
<P>
Dietrick said the strips act like farm field insectaries for natural
enemies, providing habitat for larger numbers of resident beneficials
in relation to their hosts, and helping to control noxious weeds.
 Dietrick said that &quot;proof that pests are under biological
control on all five farms is evidenced by the farmers' ability
to market quality fruit competitively, and pest population increases
observed where beneficials are disturbed.&quot;<BR>
<P>
He said diversity of cover crop species is less critical than
the protection of soil surfaces with cover crops and mulches that
provide habitat for living systems which improve biological control.
 The five farms range from the most complete coverage (shade from
trees plus ground cover) maximizing biological control and allowing
for minimum insect interference, to less managed land with large
amounts of insect and weed problems.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The duration that a farm is sustainable is less of a factor
than total soil coverage of some form of cover crop mulching system,&quot;
Dietrick said.  He noted that mulching systems to provide food
and niches for key natural enemies and the elimination of interference
with beneficials should be demonstrated in future project work.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The reason I have so much confidence in the effectiveness
of strip cutting is that I've had about 30 years experience watching
this,&quot; Dietrick said.  &quot;I'm excited about working with
these farmers.  We learned so much this last year.  Now we can
focus on some of things that will improve their farms next year.&quot;
<BR>
<H3>Farmer Perspective</H3>
<P>
After one year of on-farm research, Masumoto said two concepts
about the farms have emerged.  First, it is clear that there is
a lot of diversity, complexity and change going on simultaneously
at the five farms.<BR>
<P>
&quot;This often equals chaos, but chaos isn't necessarily bad,&quot;
he said.  &quot;In &quot;Farms work, nature's ecosystems, it is
healthy to have chaos and even in an economic/business/management
sense, chaos has its advantages.  Creativity and innovation come
out of chaos.  That's one of the keys to success, for business
people, farmers and the environment.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Masumoto said the other concept that has emerged from studying
the farms is the fact that it is hard to pinpoint how they work.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;There's no repeated pattern, in that we can't give anyone
a recipe in order to farm sustainably, nor predict what's going
to happen when they farm sustainably,&quot; he said.  &quot;I
think that's good, in the sense that it rewards innovation, it
rewards a farmer who is very close to his land, who has a good
sensibility, not only about his farm but about management, business
and the social community.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Masumoto said it is important to explore the idea of chaos in
farm work, and to tie the scientific community into this study.
 &quot;Farms work, and we don't know why.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;Here in the working world it's so much different than in
a lab, or even on a research farm,&quot; he said.  &quot;We're
trying to bridge some of those differences with our on-farm observations.
It's important to research what is happening on our farms.  Each
farmer needs to conduct their own innovative on-farm research.&quot;
  Masumoto said the drought is illustrating that it might be important
to farm differently.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Clearly the drought is showing how much change is occurring
everywhere, but specifically in agriculture,&quot; he said.  &quot;With
the changing dynamics of less water, there's a whole new agenda
being formed.  Sustainable farming is by its very nature farming
differently every day.  It gets back to 'change/diversity/chaos,'
which some people see as a vicious circle, but we see as a natural
circle.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Masumoto said the project is continuing to observe how the individual
farmers make decisions based on their own sense of their land,
and their recognition that everything added to the land affects
the entire farming system.<BR>
<P>
In the next year, the project will be examining on-farm research.
 &quot;How does science examine a changing environment?&quot;
 Masumoto asked.  &quot;A simple example is what happens when
you add less water to farms.  How does that affect the farm and
the sustainable practices you're using?&quot;<BR>
<P>
Additionally, the project will be focusing on specific farming
practices, like the use of cover crops.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We'll be looking to see not simply if cover crops are good
or bad, but how long does a farm need its cover crop?  Especially
in relation to water use,&quot; he noted, adding that cover crops
use a lot of water, which may not be sustainable in drought years.
<BR>
<P>
Another specific process being examined in 1991 involves the appearance
of thrips in orchards.<BR>
<P>
&quot;In one window of a nectarine growing season they're considered
a pest, but in the next window they're beneficial insects.  We
want to look at that,&quot; he said.<BR>
<P>
Masumoto said studying thrips will be useful in understanding
both the &quot;whole farm&quot; picture and the &quot;little microcosms&quot;
that occur, like &quot;when a pest isn't a pest.&quot;<BR>
<P>
An important component of on-farm research, Masumoto said, is
the study of the farmers and the communities they live in.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The same themes that we see occurring in the farm ecosystems
apply,&quot; Masumoto said. &quot;Farmers are constantly changing,
their needs are changing, they're very diverse.  Most research
projects tended to look at the farm only, and ignore the farmer.
 We're looking at management  decisions  and  the  decision-making
process.  We're examining innovation, how it works on farms. 
Sustainable farming by its very nature has necessitated innovation.&quot;

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Black medic, English Trefoil (Quinlivan et al.), yellow trefoil (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Quinlivan et al.  state that the crop is late maturing. According to Finch & Sharp (1983), seed maturity is in mid-April to May.<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>This is generally considered an annual or perennial herb (Duke, 1981), but it has also been termed semi-biennial (McLeod, 1982). In Western Australia, black medic behaves as an annual. In Europe and other Australian states, biennial and perennial forms are also found (Quinlivan et al.).  The plant starts growth in the winter but puts most of its growth on during the spring; it is regarded as early maturing (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Annual or perennial herb with stems pubescent, prostrate or ascending, four angled, up to 60 cm tall; leaves pinnately trifoliate; leaflets cuneate-obovate, up to 20 mm long, 12 mm wide, pubescent on both surfaces, denticulate; stipules green. Racemes dense, axillary, 5-50 flowered; corolla yellow, 2.5-3 mm long; and pods 1-seeded (Duke, 1981).  The plant surface is for the most part hairy.  The leaflets are usually rounded.  Petioles in the rosette may be as long as 7 cm, while on the runners they are usually about 1 cm.  The flower stalk is as long as the leaf stalk and elongates further in fruit.  The flowers are in distinctive, crowded, oblong heads composed of 20 to 50 tiny flowers.  The petals are only just longer than the calyx teeth. The fruits are spineless, single seeded, and kidney-shaped or discoid, being coiled on at the end. The pods blacken when ripe (resulting in the name black medic) and may or may not have hairs.  The radiating veins on the surface are very clear and appear almost concentric.  The species is difficult to classify taxonomically because different strains show some but not all of the features of the genus <I>Medicago</I></B>, whereas in general appearance the plants are similar to <I>Melilotus</I></B> spp. (sweetclovers and sourclover) (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The seeds are small, round or oval, 1 to 2.5 mm long and 0.75 to 1.75 mm wide, and the radicle is longer than half the length of the cotyledons (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) notes that most black medic stands are volunteer, that no special cultural procedures are needed to maintain such stands, and that black medic has been noted for tolerance of bacteria, high pH, limestone, low pH, mycobacteria, slope, virus, and weeds.<P> Goldstein and Young (1987) compared a conventional winter wheat-spring barley-winter wheat-spring peas rotation to low-input rotation of peas+black medic-medic-wheat rotation for the Palouse region of Washington state.  The latter is termed a "perpetuating-alternative-legume-system" (PALS), because the medic will reseed and reestablish.  Based on results from field trials, PALS generated higher net returns when market prices were used, but the converse was true when government target prices were employed.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Black medic does not tolerate salinity (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The black medic variety 'Virgo' outperforms other varieties (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Black medic shows poor tolerance to shade (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Black medic seed costs are moderate: $1.50/lb.  At 15 lb/a, this translates to $22.00 /a (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Black medic roots extend to a depth of 3-5 ft (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Black medic germination is rapid (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Black medic should be overseeded into corn when corn is 8-16" high (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>No precise figures were documented in the literature, but Brinton (1989) stated that black medic shows "good" nitrogen fixation.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Black medic overseeded into standing corn gives "fair" soil coverage (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Black medic overseeded into standing corn gives "fair" weed suppression (Brinton, 1989).  In replicated pot and field trials, wheat was grown with undersown black medic, <I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> L., Persian clover, <I>Trifolium resupinatum</I></B> L., and various associated weeds.  In both pot and field trials, biomass of weeds alive at the time of harvest was reduced substantially (50% or more reduction).  The field trials showed reduction of wheat yield, as well, for black medic and Persian clover, but a non-significantly-increased yield when white clover, <I>Trifolium repens</I></B>, was used (Hartl, W.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Black medic seed is more readily available than that of bur clover (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates are given as 6 lb/acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983), braodcast at 10-15 lb/acre (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982), and, when overseeded into standing corn, 15-20 lb/a (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Black medic is useful for forage and green manure (McLeod, 1982).  Its use and management are the same as for bur clover, and the species is well adapted to all orchard & vineyard soils (Finch & Sharp, 1983).  McLeod (1982) recommends that where clovers fail, black medic should be tried.<P> Goldstein and Young (1987) compared a conventional winter wheat-spring barley-winter wheat-spring peas rotation to low-input rotation of peas+black medic-medic-wheat rotation for the Palouse region of Washington state.  The latter is termed a "perpetuating-alternative-legume-system" (PALS), because the medic will reseed and reestablish.  Based on results from field trials, PALS generated higher net returns when market prices were used, but the converse was true when government target prices were employed.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>This species branches profusely at the base, the stems lay flat, and they attain a height of about 6-10 inches (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>According to Finch & Sharp (1983), maximum height is around 6-10 inches, but Duke (1981) says 60 cm (23.6 inches).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) states that black medic requires 500-800 mm of annual precipitation but goes on to say that it tolerates from 3.1-17.1 dm/year of precipitation.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Range of pH tolerated is 4.5-8.2, with a mean of 48 cases of 6.5 (Duke, 1981).  This species is well adapted to all soils that are neutral to slightly alkaline (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Black medic is a reliable reseeder (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> L. (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Black medic is not very palatable to livestock, yet it is nutritious (McLeod, 1982).  It is said to give good color and flavor to butter (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>McLeod (1982) suggests that black medic should never be sown alone but in mixtures with clovers and grasses; however, it does not grow well with red clover.  Black medic competes little with standing corn into which it has been overseeded, but does give "fair" soil coverage (Brinton, 1989).<P> In replicated pot and field trials, wheat was grown with undersown black medic, <I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> L., Persian clover, <I>Trifolium resupinatum</I></B> L., and various associated weeds.  In both pot and field trials, biomass of weeds alive at the time of harvest was reduced substantially (50% or more reduction).  The field trials showed reduction of wheat yield, as well, for black medic and Persian clover, but a non-significantly-increased yield when white clover, <I>Trifolium repens</I></B>, was used (Hartl, W. 19??).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Black medic survives frost once well established (Duke, 1981). This species withstands much greater cold than crimson or red clover and is similar in climatic adaptation to alsike clover; there are many varieties of diverse climatic tolerances, but in general the species grows best in a cool, moist climate (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Less susceptible to the <I>Sclerotinia</I></B> fungus than red clover (McLeod, 1982).  Duke (1981) lists 30 fungi, 1 virus (Common Pea mosaic), 1 parasitic plant (<I>Orobanche purpurea</I></B>), and 6 species of plant-parasitic nematode as attacking black medic.<P>

<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>This species is adapted to fertile soils that are not highly acid and can grow on a wide variety of soils having a good lime supply (Duke, 1981).  Best growth occurs on calcareous soils (McLeod, 1982), but black medic will not tolerate salinity (Duke, 1981).  On poor, mildly-acid soils, bur clover grows better than Black Medic (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Black Medic requires fertile soil and does not tolerate soil acidity (Duke, 1981).  Applying lime will help it grow on poor soil (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>McLeod (1982) suggests sowing in late summer or early fall, whereas Duke (1981) says that the species is usually sown in the spring.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>

<H3>USDA Western Region SARE/ACE Grants </H3>

<P>
The Administrative Council of the USDA Western Region's Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education programs are accepting proposals
for two companion competitive grant programs: The first is Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education (SARE), formerly known as LISA.
This program is funded through the USDA Cooperative State Research
Service. The second program, with many of the same goals is Agriculture
in Concert with the Environment (ACE), funded jointly by the Pollution
Prevention Office of EPA and the SARE program. Approximately $400,000
is available to fund new SARE proposals and $250,000 is available
from the ACE program for new competitive grants for the next cycle
(FY 93-94). Due to the limited funds, issues identified in the
Call for Proposals will receive priority. Proposals must be received
by 5 p.m. on October 8,1993. FAX copies will not be accepted.
Proposal authors will be notified of decisions by early April
1994. For further information contact<B> Denise Bodie,</B> University

<B>Ahmed</B>. This 90-page study was funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation and published by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance
(ILSR). It describes how plant matter (carbohydrates) provided
the raw materials from which the majority of medicines, inks,
dyes, paints, industrial materials, clothing and fuels were made
in the 1800s. By 1970, hydrocarbon-based technologies made up
95 percent of those products. Currently, the price of plant matter-derived
products is going down, while environmental regulations have raised
the price of petroleum-derived products. The result is the potential
emergence of a new carbohydrate economy, with major implications
for the environment and the economic well-being of rural America,
according to the authors. Available for $25 plus $3.75 for postage
and handing in U.S. funds from the ILSR, 2425 18th Street SW,

<H1>English/Spanish Sustainable Ag Documents<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Gall Feenstra, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">English abstracts of approximately
100 Spanish language documents on sustainable agriculture are
now available from the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program (SAREP). Abstracts in Spanish will be available
in the fall. The documents, appropriate for entry-level Hispanic
farmers and those who advise them, describe a variety of sustainable
farming and marketing practices including: soil and water conservation
practices, appropriate technologies for small-scale producers,
methods for reducing the use of pesticides, methods for employing
biological controls, and strategies for marketing organically
grown crops. Each abstract includes the author, title, source
and cost (for ordering purposes), year, a brief summary of the
contents (often with chapter headings), comments about who the
publication is intended to reach and the context within which
it was written, educational level of the intended audience, and
key words. An index of key words and topics is included with each
set of abstracts. The abstracts have been reviewed for relevancy
and usefulness by farm advisors and nonprofit organizations working
with Hispanic farmers and farmworkers. They will be widely distributed
to farm advisors and others who work with Hispanic farmers and
farmworkers in California. For information on obtaining a set
of abstracts, please contact UC SAREP at (916) 752-7556. Donations
are appreciated.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3>Four Libraries</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">As funding becomes available,
SAREP hopes to establish four regional library sites in California
to house the original Spanish documents and make them more accessible
to farm advisors and others who work with Hispanic farmers. These
four regional sites will include: the Small Farm Center in Davis,
Cooperative Extension offices in San Diego and Fresno counties
and the Rural Development Center in Salinas. These regional centers
will be clearinghouses for the information and requests pertaining
to sustainable farming for small-scale Hispanic farmers. Additional
Spanish information on sustainable agriculture will be collected
at the regional centers as it becomes available. Local planning
groups made up of Hispanic farmers and farmworkers as well as
university consultants and farm advisors will determine the most
effective mechanisms for getting the sustainable agriculture information
to Hispanic farmers in each region. <BR>

<H1>SAREP Turns 10: New PAC/TAC Members Join</H1>
<P>
It's been almost ten years since September 26, 1986, the day California
Governor <B>George Deukmejian</B> signed Senate Bill 872 into
law. Sponsored by Senator <B>Nicholas Petris</B> of Oakland, the
bill enacted the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Act of 1986, which requested the Regents of the University of
California to establish the Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program (SAREP). Petris carried the bill in response
to farmer, consumer and researcher concerns that California farming
practices be more ecologically sound, economically profitable
and socially responsible. 
<P>
SB 872 charged newly created SAREP with administering a competitive
research grants program for sustainable agricultural practices
and public policies, developing and disseminating new and existing
information on sustainable practices, and coordinating long-term
farmland research. The program found a home at UC Davis, its first
public and technical advisory committees were selected, and the
first Request for Proposals for grants went out in early 1987.
In March of that year <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B> was selected SAREP
director, the first grants were awarded to eight projects, and
the program was on its way.
<P>
&quot;We have always used the enacting legislation as our blueprint,&quot;
said Liebhardt. &quot;In the last ten years, SAREP has awarded
more than $2.8 million to approximately 200 basic and applied
research projects, economic and public policy projects, seminar
and field demonstrations and graduate student awards. It has also
provided the seed money for the first long-term irrigated farmland
study in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.&quot;
<P>
SAREP administers a second funding program to help farmers reduce
their use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, called the
Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) program. 
<P>
SAREP's enabling legislation requires it to have both public and
technical advisory committees to advise the university on program
goals and make recommendations on the award of competitive grants.
The Public Advisory Committee (PAC) includes individuals actively
involved in agricultural production, as well as representatives
from government, public organizations, and institutions of higher
education. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is made up of
universitywide faculty and staff with knowledge <BR>
and experience related to sustainable agriculture and makes recommendations
about the scientific merit of grant applications. Each PAC or
TAC members serves for three years. New members in 1996 are listed
here.
<H3>Public Advisory Committee</H3>
<P>
<B>JENNY BROOME</B> is an environmental research scientist at
the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. Her areas of

of fungal diseases of plants. She is interested in cultural and
biological control of plant pathogens, the use of weather/microclimate
monitoring to guide plant disease management, integrated pest
management, environmentally and socially just agriculture, and
viticulture.
<P>
<B> CYNTHIA CORY</B> is the director of marketing and commodities
for the California Farm Bureau Federation, and works with the
state legislature and agencies on agricultural issues. She focuses
on marketing, commodity, and transportation issues that facilitate
getting California ag products off farms and ranches into marketing
channels and ultimately to consumers. She works with a diverse
set of concerns that range from emu ranching to drug and alcohol
testing of commercial truck drivers. One of her particular interests
is in developing relationships between different sectors of agriculture
and between urban and rural communities. 
<P>
<B>DAVID COSTA</B> is a managing partner of a family farm in Lemoore,
Kings County which produces upland cotton, pima cotton, corn,
wheat, barley and alfalfa using conventional farming methods (with
an emphasis on reduced chemical inputs), cover crops and manures.
Licensed as both an agricultural and civil engineer, Costa would
like farming to remain a viable income-producing industry in California,
and to that end, wants to see issues like urban sprawl and over-regulation
addressed. He serves on various water boards and is a director
of the local Resource Conservation District board. His family
ranch cooperated with the UC in a six-year potassium deficiency
study which resulted in a major change in the way cotton and other
commodities are farmed.
<P>
<B>LEONARD DIGGS</B> is the owner/operator of Leonard Diggs Organic
Farms, a small organic operation in Sonoma County. He raises vegetable
crops including salad mix, tomatoes, specialty peppers, and strawberries.
The winner of the UC Small Farm Program's 1996 Pedro Ilic Award
for Outstanding Farmer, Diggs is particularly interested in agricultural
education. He has taught gardening to elementary level students,
teaches specialty crop production at the junior college level,
and is hoping to teach high school &quot;life skills&quot; classes
to show young people how science and the humanities affect their
lives. Diggs serves on the Sonoma County Solid Waste Board, the
Sonoma County Agriculture Literacy Project, the Sonoma County
Farm Bureau board, the UC Small Farm Program Advisory Committee,
and is active in the North Coast chapter of California Certified
Organic Farmers.
<P>
<B>JAMES LIEBMAN</B> is Staff Scientist at the Pesticide Action
Network North America Regional Center (PAN) in San Francisco,
part of an international network of citizens' organizations working
to end pesticide dependence and promote safe and sustainable pest
control. Trained as a plant pathologist, Liebman has worked extensively
on the ecology and control of agricultural soil fungi, and in
agricultural policy. Prior to his work at PAN, Liebman worked
at the Environmental Health Policy Program at the UC Berkeley
School of Public Health where he analyzed pesticide use in California
and proposed adoption of a statewide pesticide use reduction program.
He also has worked to assess and promote alternatives to the soil
fumigant methyl bromide. He is a contributing editor to the IPM
Practitioner and a member of the Materials Review Committee of
the California Certified Organic Farmers. 
<P>
<B>BROCK TAYLOR</B> is the agronomist/assistant manager of Vaquero
Farms in Stockton, San Joaquin County. He is responsible for all
water and fertilizer management decisions for processing tomatoes,
cotton, garlic and onions, and coordinates production trials and
technological innovations to produce consistent profitable production
levels and maximize resource use. A public member of the California
Department of Food and Agriculture's Fertilizer Inspection Advisory
Board and an executive member of the Fertilizer Research and Education
Subcommittee, Taylor is particularly interested in agricultural
economics and production management. He has also done agronomic
consulting in Thailand, Australia and New Zealand.

6th Stone Fruit Decline Workshop, USDA-ARS, Byron, GA. (In Press)
<BR>

<P>
Researchers in Georgia have tested numerous cover crops for their
effect on ring nematode populations (<I>Criconemella xenoplax</I>)
and a related disease of peaches known as peach tree short life
(PTSL). Of the species tested, 'Stacy' wheat showed the greatest
promise in suppressing the nematode. This paper summarizes results
of on-going research into pre and postplant uses of this wheat
variety to reduce the disease. <BR>

<H3>Peach Tree Short Life and Bacterial Canker</H3>

<P>
In the southeastern U.S., the second largest peach producing region,
PTSL is taking a huge toll on trees just coming into production.
In South Carolina alone, the disease killed 1.5 million trees
between 1980 and 1990, resulting in a loss of about $6.3 million
per year In California, the disease is known as bacterial canker,
or bacterial blast. While not as serious as in the southeast,
bacterial canker does reduce production. It also affects other
stone fruits, almonds, and pears. <BR>

<P>
<B>Symptoms</B>. The disease is expressed in several different
ways. Darkened cankers may appear on the Internal bark, which
often exude balls of amber-colored gum. In severe cases, the entire
tree may collapse, during which time the bark emits a vinegarlike
odor In the blast phase, buds in the lower portion of the tree
may fail to grow in the spring, or young shoots or blossoms may
die suddenly. <BR>

<P>
<B>Control.</B> Control of this disease has been based on choice
of rootstock and fumigation. Plum on peach (especially 'Lovell')
rootstock is less susceptible than on plum rootstock. Georgia
researchers have developed a peach rootstock that appears to be
highly resistant to PTSL. Ring nematode predisposes trees to PTSL,
so orchard soil is usually fumigated before planting. However,
with the impending loss of methyl bromide and the rising interest
in sustainable farming practices, nonchemical means of controlling
the nematodes (in this case cover crops) are being explored. 
<BR>

<H3>Cover Crop Research</H3>

<P>
This paper presents preliminary results from several three-year
research projects. <BR>

<P>
<B>Small Grain Replant Study.</B> In this experiment, from 19861989,
plots were planted to: 1) 'Stacy' wheat (no fumigation), 2) 'Lovell'
or 'Nemaguard' rootstocks (fumigated vs nonfumigated), or 3) fallow-disked
(no fumigation). In 1990, all plants were removed and 'Loring'/'Nemaguard'
peaches were planted to all plots. In 1991 and 1992, nematode
densities and incidence of PTSL were substantially greater in
nonfumigated peach plots than the other treatments (table 1).
The data also showed that, while ring nematodes were found in
all plots in the second year, growing 'Stacy' wheat for three
years was comparable to preplant fumigation in reducing incidence
of PTSL. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Rotation Study.</B> The purpose of this study was to the effects
of three-, two- and one-year plantings of 'Stacy' (prior to peach
planting) on ring nematode densities. Treatments included: 1)
Wheat+fallow, 2) a wheat+sorghum double crop (using a sorghum
cultivator that is a poor host to ring nematodes), and 3) peach
alone, nonfumigated. The 3-year, 2-year, and 1-year sequences
were initiated in the late fall of 1990, 1991, and 1992, respectively.
In order to provide a food source for nematodes before the 2-
and 1-year rotations were initiated, peach seedlings were planted
in the first year of the study; they were removed before initiating
each of these treatments. The entire test site will be planted
to peaches in the winter of 1994. <BR>

<P>
Initial results show that both two years and one year of each
wheat planting greatly reduced nematode densities compared to
peach alone (table 2). (<I>Reviewer's note: In the rotation plots,
nematode densities remained at a level that could be economically
damaging in a fumigated orchard. The reason is that, in fumigated
soil, ring nematode densities may increase drastically with little
competition or natural enemies and ample peach roots for food.
The effects of these nematode densities on trees in an unfumigated,
cover-cropped orchard may be less because natural enemy populations
would likely be higher</I>.) <BR>

<P>
<B>Wheat Interplanting Study</B>. The researchers tested the ability
of 'Stacy' wheat to control nematodes as a postplant management
strategy. The treatments used were wheat, herbicide alone, and
herbicide plus postplant nematicide (phenamiphos). The wheat was
planted in five-foot strips on either side of the tree row. After
two years, none of the treatments were adequately reducing nematode
populations. <BR>

<P>
<B>Root Exudate Study.</B> This study evaluated attraction and/or
repulsiveness of 'Stacy' wheat and 'Nemaguard' peach root extracts
to ring nematodes. Root extracts were prepared, freeze-dried,
and redissolved in water. The solution was poured onto a paper
disc, which was placed on either end of a rectangular strip of
water agar in a petri dish. Seven nematodes were then placed on
a drop of water in the center of the agar strip. Nematodes were
subjected to the following choices: peach vs. water, peach vs.
wheat, wheat vs. water,  water vs. water. Wheat extract was not
repulsive to nematodes, since more nematodes migrated toward wheat
when presented with wheat or water. Peach, however, was more attractive
than either wheat or water. <BR>

<P>
After two years of the study, it appears that 'Stacy' wheat is
demonstrating more potential as a preplant rather than a postplant
management strategy for the ring nematode and PTSL. <BR>

<H3>Clinton Budget Deletes Funding for Organic Food Programs<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The Fiscal Year 1994 budget submitted
to Congress in April by the Clinton Administration was a major
disappointment for advocates of organic agriculture. It failed
to include any funding for USDA's implementation of the Organic
Food Act or for continuing the work of the National Organic Standards
Board. This contrasts with the budget submitted by the Bush Administration
a year ago, which proposed full funding for the program. Organic
food supporters must now try to convince members of Congress to
add funding for organic agriculture into the 1994 budget. For

<H3>USDA Links &quot;White Lupin&quot; to Sustainable Agriculture
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">USDA researchers have identified
white lupin, a grain-legume developed in the 1950s, as having
the potential to aid sustainable agriculture in the 1990s. The
key is white lupin's nitrogen-fixing ability. In rotation with
other crops, white lupin can restore nitrogen to depleted soils,
avoiding the need for nitrogen fertilizer. It can also be used
to increase the fiber content of many foods, including pasta and
cereals. See &quot;New Food,&quot; </FONT><I>Nutrition Week, </I><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">March

<H3>Promoting Food Stamp Use at Farmers' Markets<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">After three years of demonstration
projects, the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) became
a permanent federal program in August 1992. The program provides
participants in the Food Program for Women, Infants and Children
(WIC) with $10 to $20 in farmers' market coupons in addition to
their regular benefits. The aim of the program is twofold: 1)
to provide clients with access to affordable, highly nutritious
food, and 2) to help provide farmers with a boost from additional
customers. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), which oversees
the program at the federal level, estimates that 450,000 people
will be served by the program in 1993. Farmers' participation
as vendors in the program is often easier than they believe. To

<H3>National Dialogue on Sustainable Agriculture<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Representatives of more than 100
different grass roots organizations met in Washington, D.C. in
late February to launch a national campaign to promote sustainable
agriculture in the 1995 Farm Bill. Present were groups from a
range of perspectives, including advocates of rural development,
animal rights, traditional farm policy, consumers and the environment.
Committees formed at the meeting will produce policy recommendations
which will then be debated by local members of the various organizations.
This grass roots input will lead to a national conference set
for spring 1994 at which a platform will be adopted to form the
basis for lobbying efforts. During the policy formulation phase,
researchers will be enlisted to buttress recommendations with
detailed analysis.<BR>

<H3>U.S. Begins Long-Term Study of Farm Family Health<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Three national agencies are launching
a project to monitor the health of farmers, farmworkers, and their
families, in what will be the largest agriculture-related health
study ever undertaken in the U.S. Collaborating on the 10-year
project are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National
Cancer Institute (NCI), and the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences (NIEHS). The project will follow two groups of
farm families, one in Iowa, and one in North Carolina. In all,
more than 100,000 people will be monitored, including male and
female farmers, farmers' spouses, agricultural pesticide applicators,
and their children. For more information, contact the Office of

<H3>Magnet High School for Agriculture and Environmental Sciences
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Beginning in the fall of 1992,
Pioneer High School in San Jose, California became a magnet school
specializing in agriculture and environmental sciences. It is
the only school of its kind west of the Rockies, reflecting both
the growing agricultural literacy movement and the new reform
movement in high school education. The curriculum approaches the
study of agriculture within a broader concern for the way humans
interact with the environment. It also takes into account the
changing nature of the food system, given that much of the growth
in agricultural employment is now in technical or marketing areas,
rather than in production. For more information, see </FONT><B>Sibella</B>

Faculty of Economics, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's Note: This paper describes a valuable and practical
method of managing meetings whereby farmers and scientists can
collaborate to solve complex problems. This approach is becoming
increasingly popular because it can unleash collective creativity
while reducing conflict. The technique is especially relevant
in developing understanding of interrelationships among sustainable
agricultural practices, which are often more complex than among
those in chemically-intensive farming.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Agricultural researchers use lectures, publications, and demonstrations
for communicating <B>to </B>farmers. Surveys and focus groups
are emphasized in order to obtain information <B>from</B> farmers.
The farmer/scientist focus session (FSFS) makes use of the creativity
and synergy that arise when farmers and scientists listen to each
other and learn as a team. FSFSs are especially useful in addressing
complex cropping or livestock systems, in designing experiments,
and to enquire into controversial issues that have incomplete
research bases.<BR>

<P>
Although farmers often conduct studies on their own farms and
discuss the results with each other, they participate little in
planning and implementing research and extension efforts conducted
at universities and other governmental institutions. The FSFS
technique can aid in the integration of these separate research
approaches. Depth and breadth of knowledge differ among farmers,
extension agents, extension specialists, and research scientists
(Fig.1). For example, farmers typically have greater breadth but
lesser depth of knowledge about farming systems than do University
scientists. These differences lead to complementarity in the context
of FSFSs. The technique works best when more than half of the
members are growers, and there are from 8 to 20 group members.

</I>
<H3><B>Participant Roles</B></H3>

<P>
The FSFS is not a transfer process by which one subgroup gives
and another receives information. Rather, the process provides
a forum for discovery by all participants. The approach may require
acclimation, with scientists learning to restrain themselves and
farmers encouraged to speak. FSFSs works best when the team members
are jointly responsible for managing and developing the meeting.
<BR>

<P>
Key roles are the<B> facilitator</B>, the <B>process observer</B>,
and the <B>recorder</B>(s). The <B>facilitator</B> controls the
flow of the meeting, requesting clarification where necessary,
and draws out quiet members while respectfully restraining those
who are more outgoing. The facilitator does not insert personal
opinions.<BR>

<P>
The <B>process observer</B> quietly watches the meeting and helps
guide it by providing non-verbal cues to the facilitator. The
process observer may also request a break in the meeting or a
change of roles if the meeting gets off-track.<BR>

<P>
<B>Recorders </B>register the group memory. When participants
see their ideas recorded, they relax. The group memory also enables
group ownership of these ideas. If possible, two recorders or
note takers are desirable. One develops a &quot;discussion map&quot;
that depicts the relationship of themes and sub-themes discussed.
This map is organized much like a strawberry plant with runner
plants spreading out in different directions. The other recorder
transcribes the proceedings in greater detail using a conventional
outline form.<BR>

<H3><B>Conducting the Meeting</B></H3>

<P>
Coordinators should reiterate or clarify goals and boundaries
at the outset of the session to avoid misconceptions that may
persist despite prior correspondence or phone conversation with
group members. Narrow definition of content is important where
a specific, urgent problem is being addressed. A two to three-hour
session with a long break may generate tentative solutions to
such problems. In order to evaluate the success of FSFSs, it may
be important for participants to establish at the outset what
they would consider successful outcomes. These might include better
understanding of an issue, a written document depicting a problem
and a list of alternative solutions, identifying key researchable
issues, a better sense of teamwork, or learning more about issues.
<BR>

<P>
Time boundaries are also a consideration. Complicated issues may
require two to three sessions over several weeks. Such sessions
may be organized to begin with general discussion and become increasingly
specific. Gaps between sessions allow reflection that can lead
to improvements. For issues that are neither narrowly defined
nor pressing, there may be no established boundaries. If such
sessions are not managed carefully, they may drift into pointless
complaining. By contrast, with proper handling, such meetings
can promote greater understanding of a range of viewpoints.<BR>

<P>
In managing FSFSs, a horseshoe seating arrangement with a board
in front focuses attention on the issue and reduces emphasis on
personality. This arrangement is superior to a circle of chairs,
which encourages debate, or rows of chairs, which encourage passive
listening. The facilitator should announce at the beginning that
all are expected to participate, and that the group as a whole
is responsible for preventing strong personalities from dominating
and for increasing the involvement of quieter people. Participants
should then be asked to introduce themselves, and to share their
concerns. Other techniques involve writing before speaking; this
generates more ideas because all participants are engaged intellectually,
not just those who are speaking.<BR>

<P>
Rather than allowing the group to plunge directly into debate
on the &quot;best solution&quot; to a problem, discussion should
start out broad, enabling the evolution of a &quot;rich picture&quot;
of the issues. This is the <B>brainstorming phase</B>, and should
not involve judgments or analyses of individual comments. Important
themes will emerge during this phase.<BR>

<P>
At some point in the discussion, the need for a phase change will
arise. A <B>short break</B> at this point allows informal discussion
in small groups. After the break, it is time to <B>prioritize
the</B> <B>themes</B> that emerged during the earlier brainstorming.
Next, the group can <B>brainstorm potential</B> <B>solutions</B>.
In the final phase, the <B>proposed solutions are evaluated critically</B>.
<BR>

<P>
Closure of FSFSs usually occurs after two to three hours, and
can involve verbal and visual cues from the facilitator. Closing
thoughts of participants may be requested, and an evaluation of
the session is typically made, including an appraisal of the overall
value of the meeting and of specific aspects.<BR>

<H3><B>Post-Meeting Follow-up</B></H3>

<P>
After the meeting, the planning team holds debriefing and reporting
sessions, at which notes are again taken. The recorders organize
the group memory and circulate it among all participants, setting
a deadline for corrections and additions. The resulting document
may be used in newsletters or for special mailings to interested
parties.<BR>

<P>
Several references on related themes are listed at the end of
the manual.<BR>

<H1>Western Sustainable Ag Training Program Underway</H1>

<P>
<I>by Kristen Kelleher, Western U.S. USDA SARE/ACE</I>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education (SARE) program in the Western U.S. recently awarded
nearly a half million dollars in educational grants to several
universities and non-profit organizations.  The purpose of the
grants is to kick off a federally-legislated &quot;train the trainers&quot;
effort to instruct Extension Service and Natural Resource Conservation
Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service) personnel and others
in sustainable agriculture concepts and practices.  The Western
region SARE program is coordinated by soil scientist <B>V. Philip
Rasmussen </B>and hosted by Utah State University.
<P>
&quot;We've hit the ground running this year with a handful of
solid, ground-breaking training projects,&quot; says Rasmussen.
 &quot;The SARE regional leadership worked closely with selected
training project leaders to make sure that every state and territory
in the West would have access to at least one educational effort.&quot;
<P>
&quot;One goal of this grants program is to train Extension advisors
and other professionals, but the end users are really farmers
and ranchers,&quot; says <B>A.J.</B> <B>Dye, </B>USDA program
leader for this $2.96 million national effort.
<P>
Rasmussen also announced that <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>, </B>UC SAREP
associate director, will act as training coordinator.  Auburn
will organize the annual educational grants cycle and link training
projects with similar state, federal and private outreach efforts.
<P>
Auburn was a founding member of the Sustainable Agriculture Network
(SAN), a national information-gathering and electronic networking
initiative of the national SARE program and has been involved
in sustainable agriculture for 15 years.  Auburn completed her
doctorate at the University of California, Davis.
<P>
The competitive research grants portion of SARE, known as Chapter
1, has been funded since 1988.  The new training effort, most
often called Chapter 3, received funding for the first time in
the 1994 federal fiscal year.  Both grants programs are administered
by USDA's newly-combined Cooperative State Research, Education
and Extension Service (formerly the separate Cooperative State
Research Service and the Extension Service).
<H3>Grant Awards and Selection </H3>

<P>
Western SARE Chapter 3 grant awards include:
<UL>
<LI>$ 78,000 for a four-state &quot;Pacific Northwest Sustainable
Agricultural Systems Training    Program&quot; involving Oregon,
Washington, Alaska and Idaho to be coordinated by <B>John</B>
<B>Luna </B>of Oregon State University.
<P>

<P>
The selection process for the first round of grant awards and
a regional training coordinator was conducted simultaneously and
directed by the program's Administrative Council.  Regional recommendations
were then approved by the USDA.
<H3>New Calls for Proposals Released</H3>

<P>
In one of her first duties as training coordinator, Auburn recently
initiated the Chapter 3 grants cycle for the current federal fiscal
year.  A Call for Proposals for educational and professional development
training projects was released in the fall of 1994; proposals
were due January 10, 1995.
<H3>State-by-State Strategic Planning</H3>

<P>
According to Auburn, in addition to awarded grants, every state
Extension Service has been given financial support to develop
educational strategies for training their personnel in sustainable
agriculture.  The federal Extension Service has directed state
offices to bring together a variety of players to work on the
plans.  It is actively encouraging strategies that take advantage
of existing resources and encourages long-term dialogue within
the extended agricultural community.
<P>
&quot;It's a terrific opportunity for Extension and land-grant
universities to work with farm advocates, educators and private
industry outside the federal system on a vital task: sharing the
latest scientific research and technologic s related to sustainable
agriculture,&quot; says Auburn.
<P>
In California, statewide planning is being coordinated by UC SAREP
Director and State Extension Sustainable Agriculture Leader Bill
Liebhardt (see &quot;SAREP Coordinates Statewide Planning&quot;,
p.9). To find out the extension leader in other states, contact
that state's Cooperative Extension Service o r Auburn at (916)
757-3278.
<H3>About SARE</H3>

<P>
The national SARE initiative is directed regionally by four independent
policy-making councils: West, North Central, Northeast and Southern
United States.  In cooperation with the federal SARE office and
the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service,
these regional committees of scientists, farmers and administrators
represent a variety of institutions, agencies, organizations and
interests that provide regional perspective and leadership to
all research, educational and training efforts.
<P>
Utah State University is host to the SARE program in the thirteen-state
Western region, which includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington,
Wyoming and the Island Protectorates.

<H1>Earthworms: Renewers of Agroecosystems</H1>
<P>
<I>by Matthew Werner,</I>
<P>
<I>UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program, and</I>
<P>
<I>Robert L. Bugg, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
The Hindu pantheon includes a multitude of deities, but the principal
trinity are Brahma the creator, Vishnu the sustainer, and Shiva
the destroyer. Creation, sustention, and destruction, they interconnect
and operate in balance through the cycles of nature. By contrast,
in western religions the destructive forces of the universe are
generally seen as evil. Emblematic of these destructive  forces
 is  the  worm, destroyer of all things mortal. Yet in our efforts
to create a more sustainable agriculture, we may need more balance
in our appraisal of the great destructive forces of nature, and
of the worm in particular.<BR>
<P>
For all its destructive reputation, the worm, paradoxically, has
a crucial role to play in building. As noted by Charles Darwin
in his 1882 classic, <I>The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through
 the  Action  of Earthworms with Observations on Their Habits,
</I>earthworms process huge quantities of plant litter and help
convert it into rich topsoil, liberating nutrients for renewed
plant growth. More recent studies show that earthworms can help
reduce soil compaction, improving permeability and aeration. Earthworms
do this through burrowing activities, ingestion of soil along
with plant debris, and subsequent excretion of casts. Upon drying,
these casts form water-stable soil aggregates.  These aggregates
are clumps of soil particles bound together by organic compounds,
and their presence helps improve soil structure, retain nutrients
that might otherwise be leached, and reduce the threat of erosion.
<BR>
<P>
Earthworms are only part of the complex of organisms termed &quot;decomposers&quot;
in agroecology.   Other destroyers include springtails (Collembola),
nematodes, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. Earthworms themselves
fall into several subgroups based on their behavioral ecology:
epigeic, endogeic, and anecic.<BR>
<P>
Epigeic earthworms are those that live in the superficial soil
layers and feed on undecomposed plant litter. These worms are
usually small and produce new generations rapidly.<BR>
<P>
Endogeic species are those which forage below the soil surface
in horizontal, branching burrows. These species ingest large amounts
of soil, showing a preference for soil rich in organic matter.
Endogeics may have a major impact on the decomposition of dead
plant roots, but are not important in the incorporation of surface
litter.<BR>
<P>
Anecic earthworms build permanent, vertical burrows that extend
deep into the soil. This type of worm comes to the surface to
feed on manure, leaf litter, and other organic matter. Anecics,
  such   as   the nightcrawlers, <I>Lumbricus terrestris </I>and
<I>Aporrectodea longa, </I>have profound effects on decomposition
of organic matter and the formation of soil.<BR>
<P>
Deep tillage is generally harmful to earthworms. It can kill them
outright, disrupt their burrows, lower soil moisture, and reduce
the availability of surface litter. Shallow tillage, ridge-tillage,
 and  surface management of crop residues has often led to increases
in earthworm activity compared to areas where deep tillage is
practiced. Earthworms favor leaf litter that has a low ratio of
carbon to nitrogen, and tend to prefer residues of clovers and
other legumes over residues of grass. Residues left as surface
mulch are very useful in enhancing earthworm densities.<BR>
<P>
Certain pesticides are particularly harmful to earthworm populations.
These include aldicarb, carbaryl, carbofuran, benomyl, and most
soil fumigants. Most herbicides are probably not directly damaging
to earthworms at the normal rates of use. Some inorganic fertilizers,
especially ammonium sulfate, can be harmful to earthworm populations,
possibly due to an acidifying affect.<BR>
<P>
Much of the research on earthworm agroecology has been conducted
in areas with humid cool-temperate climates. Relatively little
research has occurred in regions with Mediterranean climates.
Native California earthworms particularly are still poorly documented
and understood. The most complete collection of native earthworms
was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and has never
been restored.<BR>
<P>
There is still little research on the roles of earthworms in Californian
agroecosystems. Preliminary observations suggest that earthworms
in some California agricultural soils tend to have small populations
of endogeic species that are active for short periods during the
rainy season. More information is needed to take full advantage
of the potential benefits of including earthworms in sustainable
agriculture practices. What earthworm species/behavioral groups
inhabit California ecosystems? Can earthworm species be introduced
that are suited to particular agroecosystems? How does irrigation
affect earthworm activity patterns?  Are earthworms affected by
botanical insecticides? What management practices will sustain
crop productivity by promoting earthworm activity? These questions
are a starting point for observation and experimentation.<BR>

<H1>Agriculture's Agenda<BR>
</H1>
<P>
California growers find themselves in a vulnerable position. The
combined issues of food safety and environmental problems caused
by agricultural practices have been building for many years.<BR>
<P>
In food safety, the use of Alar on apples hit the front pages
of newspapers and magazines across the country last winter. The
Alar issue is symbolic of the credibility problem that agriculture
faces. Consumers do not believe that the regulatory process is
protecting their interests. As a result of this lack of credibility,
many stores and consumers are making independent judgments about
food safety that affect the marketplace. Increasingly, people
want food they believe is clean, healthy and nutritious at an
affordable price -but they are also willing to pay more for produce
that does not contain pesticide residues.
<H3>Growers are Vulnerable</H3>
<P>
As a result of these collective decisions in the marketplace and
the judgment of legislators who follow consumer movements, growers
are increasingly vulnerable to market and legislative actions.
Even if chemicals used on crops are approved, the produce may
not be accepted in the marketplace by consumers. And increasingly,
chemical production tools are  being  removed  from  the marketplace
by either legislative or chemical company action. As one grower
told me 18 months ago, laws without alternatives don't help. Increasingly,
growers want alternatives to toxic materials which are disruptive
to their production systems or which interfere with the marketing
of their products.
<H3>Set Our Own Goal</H3>
<P>
The question is, how is agriculture going to reduce its vulnerability
to these forces? Most importantly, we must decide on a primary
goal- <I>that we will move agriculture toward economically and
environmentally sound production and marketing practices.  </I>Individual
 farmers and ranchers, public institutions such as<I> </I>the
University of California and the
<P>
California Department of Food and Agriculture, agricultural organizations
and chemical companies can help. This goal makes good business
sense. In a marketplace economy, those who produce what consumers
want will remain in business.<BR>
<P>
Working toward the goal of economically and environmentally sound
farming will help reduce agriculture's vulnerability. And, finally,
it is a step in helping <I>agriculture </I>set agriculture's agenda.

<P><I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">Dave Campbell</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>, SAREP</I> </P>

<P>The relentless pace of global economic integration and dramatic changes
in national agricultural policy are reshaping how food is produced, processed
and distributed. One response to these changes has been an increasing interest
in &quot;community food systems.&quot; This approach seeks to build community
within a neighborhood, city or region by implementing strategies to increase
the self-reliance of the regional food economy. Across California, local
collaborations are creating new ties among farmers, civic organizations,
non-profit groups, consumers and elected officials. </P>

<P>To showcase the most innovative collaborations and to explore the many
questions surrounding their development, SAREP, the Community Alliance
with Family Farmers, the Community Food Security Coalition, and the UC
California Communities Program will host a conference Oct. 2-3, 1996 at
UC Davis. &quot;Community Food Systems: Sustaining Farms and People in
the Emerging Economy&quot; will feature: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Keynote addresses that articulate why a renewed experience of community
is essential to civic vitality and economic prosperity in the years ahead;
</LI>

<LI>Panel presentations of innovative community food system projects from
across California, including SAREP-funded projects; </LI>

<LI>Plenaries that describe coalitions, institutions and businesses that
can promote the long-term sustainability of community food systems; </LI>

<LI>Workshops in which to learn and share practical skills for developing
community food systems; </LI>

<LI>Time for networking and building bridges of cooperation among allies;
</LI>

<LI>Social time, food, culture and entertainment at the famous Davis Farmers'
Market; </LI>

<LI>Delicious lunches prepared from locally grown foods. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The conference is intended for a diverse audience, including representatives
of community-based organizations, Cooperative Extension, farmers, university
faculty, anti-hunger and food security representatives, farmers, market

<H1>Scavenging Nitrogen in Orchards<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP and Rick Miller; Agronomy and Range
Science Department, UC Davis<BR>
</I>
<P>
Nitrate levels in many wells throughout California exceed established
health standards, largely due to percolation of highly contaminated
water from agricultural soils. Soil water beneath fertilized orchards,
for example, can exceed 100 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of nitrate-nitrogen,
while health levels in drinking water have been set at 10 mg/l.
Nitrate leaching may be especially serious in tree crops, since
the proportion of nitrogen removed in the harvested crop to the
fertilizer applied is often far less with tree crops than in other
crops. Many practices aimed at improving nitrogen-use efficiency
have been developed, although many gaps in information still exist.
Overfertilization in tree crops is still common because most growers
rely on synthetic fertilizers.<BR>

<P>
One strategy that will reduce nitrate leaching is the use of winter
annual cover crops. These covers grow during the period when uptake
of nitrogen by trees is at a minimum and percolation from rainfall
is greatest. While few growers have economic or legal incentives
to grow cover crops solely to prevent nitrate leaching, it is
one of many benefits of cover cropping and should be an integral
part of orchard floor management decisions.<BR>

<H3>Timely Growth<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The amount of nitrogen taken up by the cover crop is closely related
to the biomass production of the cover crop. Cover crops must
grow vigorously in the fall and winter to be most effective. In
some orchards, this requirement maybe difficult to meet. For example,
drip irrigated orchards are usually dependent on fall rain for
cover crop germination, but rain often does not occur until November.<I>
</I>Also<I>, </I>late harvesting in walnut orchards can delay
cover crop planting until November.<BR>

<H3>Effects of Cover Crop Species<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<B>Resident Vegetation. </B>Using resident vegetation, or weeds,
can be an inexpensive and simple way to capture soil nitrate.
However, the amount of nitrate taken up by weeds varies greatly
among species. Since weed species composition among orchards varies
greatly, resident vegetation will vary in its nitrate uptake capacity.
Chemical mowing in the aisles often results in a weed population
with little biomass and therefore a negligible effect on nitrogen
cycling.<BR>

<P>
<B>Nonlegumes </B>Nonlegume cover crops will often accumulate
about 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre. However, they have been
shown to accumulate up to 100 to 150 pounds. Most of the research
on nitrate scavenging in nonlegumes has focused on a few key species.
Of the grasses, cereal rye has received the most attention, although
others have been successfully used, such as barley, annual ryegrass,
oats, and wheat. The crucifers showing the greatest potential
include oilseed radish, mustard, rape, and turnip. Another cover
crop species which has shown promise in lettuce rotations is phacelia,
also called bee phacelia.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes</B>. Legumes will use symbiotic nitrogen fixation to
obtain nitrogen, but only when soil nitrate levels are low. While
legumes usually recover less nitrate than nonlegumes, one study
showed that vetch acquired 125 pounds of nitrogen per acre from
a high-nitrogen soil. The remainder of the nitrogen in the vetch-about
70 pounds-was derived from nitrogen fixation. Mixing grasses and
legumes is a practical strategy for both conserving and adding
nitrogen.<BR>

<H3>Effects on Tree Nutrition</H3>

<P>
While cover crops can greatly affect nitrate leaching, it is also
important to consider their effects on tree nutrition. The carbon-to-nitrogen
ratio (C/N ratio) of residues is an indicator of subsequent nutrient
availability. With the incorporation into the soil of a high C/N
ratio material (e.g., grass residue), microorganisms will scavenge
available nitrogen from the soil, creating a temporary deficiency
for the trees. If a low C/N ratio material is incorporated into
moist soil, it will decompose rapidly and will release a large
flush of available nitrogen in the soil within a few weeks. The
time of incorporation (spring) corresponds to the time of high
demand by tree crops. The C/N ratios of some residues are as follows:
<BR>
<BR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=151>Grass</TD><TD WIDTH=114>40:1 to 80:1</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Under nontillage, residues with a high C/N ratio will decompose
slowly due to a lack of nitrogen source for microorganisms which
decompose surface mulch. The nitrogen contained in the residue
will become available to plants only after the residue has become
incorporated into the soil organic matter pool. If low C/N residue
is left on the surface, microbial decomposition will be more rapid
because of the favorable nutrient status. About 80 to 85 percent
of the nitrogen in cover crops is contained in the above-ground
portion.<BR>

<H3><B>Limitations on Effectiveness<BR>
</B></H3>

<P>
Several obstacles can limit cover crop production and nitrate
scavenging in orchards. These limitations usually do not preclude
the ability to grow cover crops. However, they can reduce their
ability to scavenge nitrate.<BR>

<P>
<B>Herbicide strips. </B>The ability of cover crops to remove
nitrate is reduced by the use of herbicide strips. For example,
an orchard with rows 24 feet apart and with a 6-foot herbicide
strip has only 75 percent of the soil planted to cover crops.
In addition, some growers fertilize in the treated strips only,
since this area contains a large portion of the tree roots. During
the winter, fertilizer nitrogen remaining in the strips may easily
leach beyond the tree root zone, especially if late summer or
fall applications were made.<BR>

<P>
<B>Shading. </B>Deciduous orchards with a complete canopy cover
can cast considerable shade on the orchard floor in the fall and
spring. Shading from the branch structure of deciduous trees probably
has minimal effect on cover crop growth during the winter. Cover
crops grown in citrus orchards, however, may receive little or
no direct sunlight, especially in orchards with east-west row
orientation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Winter orchard operations. </B>Cover crops in orchards can
rarely be left undisturbed during the winter. The traffic required
for pruning and spraying can seriously diminish the growth capacity
of the cover. Most species can tolerate a moderate amount of traffic,
however, especially when they are older. One operation that can
nearly eliminate most cover crops is pushing brush out of the
orchard. This practice should be done before planting or seedling
emergence. Cover crops could also be planted in alternate rows,
with brush stacked on rows with resident vegetation. Alternatively,
large wood can be removed and smaller wood can be shredded with
equipment now on the market.<BR>

<P>
Cover crops offer an important way to conserve excess soil nitrate
during winter and to supply nitrogen when needed by the trees
in the spring. Because of these and other benefits, orchardists
should consider using cover crops rather than relying solely on
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers for managing nitrogen. Cover cropping
can then become a tool for integrated floor and fertility management.

<H1><U>From the Director</U> - Long-Term Research Necessary<BR>
</H1>

<P>
The legislation that authorized SAREP in 1986 states that the
program should address long-term issues related to sustainable
agriculture. The concept of<BR>
sustainability implies a long-term view, which is necessary to
evaluate many of the processes in nature and agriculture. It is
important that society support long-term research so that we can
see the effect of farming practices on the natural resource base.
For example, the practice that led to the 1930s dust bowl-plowing
the prairies-actually began about 100 years earlier. 
<P>
Maintaining California's resource base is part of an intergenerational
equity question: What is our generation's responsibility to the
future? (See &quot;Sharing the Cost of Land Tenure and Stewardship,&quot;
p. 4.) In many areas of the world, the environment has been severely
degraded because there was little or no thought about the needs
of the future. Once the environment is degraded, productivity
decreases, which reduces society's ability to feed itself. In
his book <I>O</I>ut of the Earth-Civilization and the Life of
the Soil ( The Free Press, 1991), soil scientist <B>Daniel J.
Hillel</B> says:
<P>
<I>We live in an age and culture that is very sensitive to human
rights, but does not grant equal weight to human responsibilities.
We insist on our prerogatives, and neglect our obligations. Our
attitude toward the environment is marked by careless confidence
and reckless self-indulgence. These are the attitudes and actions
that, in any individual, we recognize as childish. And just as
a mature person must learn to consider the circumstances and needs
of others, so a mature society must restrain its exploitation
of resources and consider both the rights of future generations
and the needs of other species.</I>
<P>
Intermediate-length research such as that being conducted at the
Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems project at UC Davis and
other sites (see Technical Reviews, p.9 and p.11) begins to address
some long-term issues. Nonetheless, a commitment to real long-term
research is essential to fully understand the ramifications of
our farming practices. As a major research institution, it is
the responsibility of the University of California to address
these long-term issues. In 1990 SAREP funded a group of UC Davis
researchers who initiated the first 100-year irrigated farmland
research site in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.
SAREP provided $150,000 to begin the experiment. Since that time
both the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR)
and the UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences
have committed substantial resources to keep this research going.
In addition to its considerable scientific value, the Long-term
Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) project at UCD is a very
worthy effort, for it is an acknowledgment by those of us living
that we have a responsibility to the next generations. The experiments
are under the leadership of<B> Ford Denison</B> of the Agronomy
Department at UCD. Denison and other scientists have two years
experience at the site, and have made good progress in the set-up
of long-term research, and in experiments that can provide information
that is useful right now. Important questions relating long-term
sustainability and soil, air and water quality are being examined.
The effect of different levels of organic matter on soil productivity
will be researched over a long time period. For example, researchers
will be comparing treatments for which the amount of carbon inputs
varies by seven-fold. In addition to answering specific scientific
questions, this comparison may also shed light on a critical issue
related to the problem of global warming. CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>
is a greenhouse gas. If we learn how to trap or sequester this
CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> in soil organic matter, that would help
reduce atmospheric CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>, one of the culprits
implicated in global warming. The only way to identify and understand
these soil processes is to study them under carefully conducted
field studies over very long periods of time. Other issues that
will be examined at the LTRAS are water use efficiency, nitrogen
sources, organic matter management, soil health/plant health relationships,
microbial dynamics in the soil, soil physical issues, and dust
movement. As we have seen in the famous Rothamsted Classical Experiments
in Southern England and other long-term experiments started more
than 100 years ago, unforeseen issues not contemplated at the
beginning of those experiments have emerged and can be understood
because we have this long-term history.
<P>
The LTRAS experiments began in the early 1990s, when the state
and the University of California were beginning to experience
financial difficulties. It took a substantial effort by many people
to negotiate the finances of this important research. The experiment
has many individual investigators studying the sustainability
of agricultural practices within the larger context of agricultural
systems. Since contributing the initial start-up money for the
overall project, SAREP has funded an additional four-year treatment
in the original experiment. But long-term support cannot stop.
It is important to keep this experiment well-financed, as it is
the only one of its type in California. This effort must be continued
so we have a sound scientific knowledge base from which to draw
information about the future of agriculture. Agricultural practices
will continue to evolve and change in the next century, but the
basic questions addressed in this research will always be timely.
Because it is important to keep this work going into the future,
the UC must take the lead in securing funding sources to maintain
the LTRAS project and start other long-term studies.-<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>,

Advances in Soil Science, Volume 3:71-94.  1985<BR>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note: Green manures are crops which are turned into
the soil in order to improve the growth of subsequent crops. This
article reviews the non-nutrient benefits of green manures, i.e.
their potential to improve soil organic matter levels, reduce
soil compaction and soil erosion, and enhance crop yields. To
narrow the scope of the analysis, the authors focused on literature
relevant to field crop systems (mainly corn) in temperate regions.
The information presented in the article partially explains the
recent resurgence of interest in using green manures and cover
crops, and also highlights the need for more and better research
in this area. The review is a good introduction for those who
want to find out more about the reasons for using green manures.
<BR>
</I>
<H3>Historical Background</H3>
<P>
Earliest references to the use of green manures are from China,
dating back to the 12th century B.C. Ancient records from Greece
and southern Europe show that lupines and faba beans were favored
in the Mediterranean region. A seminal work by Pieters (1927),
suggests that the use of green manures occurred much later in
northern Europe, and that colonists brought the practice with
them to North America. The use of green manures on this continent
reached a peak in the beginning of the 20th century, but has declined
since the introduction of synthetic inorganic fertilizers. Historically,
farmers used green manures as a way of improving soil fertility
and increasing crop yields. Improvements in soil tilth that accrued
through regular additions of organic matter may not have been
as apparent.<BR>
<H3>Effect of Organic Matter on Soil Physical Properties</H3>
<P>
Research during this century has established that organic matter
affects some soil physical properties more than others. This review
focuses on aggregate distribution and stability, bulk density,
moisture retention, and water movement.<BR>
<P>
<B>Soil Aggregates.</B> Organic matter plays more of a role in
aggregate stability than in aggregate formation. It is, in fact,
the primary stabilizing agent for aggregates in temperate-area
soils. This stabilization process is accomplished mainly through
the by-products of organic matter decomposition (microbial gums
and mucilages).<BR>
<P>
<B>Bulk Density.</B> &quot;With few exceptions, organic matter
decreases the bulk density of soil.&quot; This effect can occur
either directly by &quot;diluting&quot; the soil with a less dense
material, or indirectly through greater aggregate stability. Indirect
effects seem to be the most important and are not dependent on
soil textural class.<BR>
<P>
<B>Moisture Content and <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Availability.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">
 Soil </FONT><FONT SIZE=4>organic </FONT>matter <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">has
</FONT>a variable effect on <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">available
</FONT>water in soil. It <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">is </FONT>generally
a positive relationship, but whether or not the effect is significant
depends on other soil properties, notably texture. One experiment,
for example, found organic matter to influence available water
only in soils of medium to low clay content (13 to 20 percent);
other 
<P>
researchers concluded that coarse silt, not organic carbon, was
the primary factor determining available water in mineral soils.
It is important to distinguish between <I>water retention </I>and
<I>water availability. </I>Some sources of organic matter (like
peat moss) have high water retention (i.e. they increase soil
water holding capacity), but a portion of this water may be held
so tightly that it is not available to plants. Increased soil
aggregation can have a similar effect.<BR>
<P>
<B>Water Movement.</B> Organic matter has a strong, positive effect
on infiltration of water into soils. This effect is due mainly
to a decrease in bulk density, and improvements in aggregation
and structure.<BR>
<H3>Effect of Green Manures on Soil Organic Matter</H3>
<P>
The maintenance or accumulation of organic matter in soils depends
on a number of factors including: characteristics of the added
material, soil and climatic factors as they affect microbial activity,
and agricultural practices. All other factors being equal, it
is generally accepted that low-nitrogen green manures (1.5 percent
N or less) can be effective in improving soil organic matter levels.
High-nitrogen materials such as legumes, on the other hand, cannot
maintain organic matter levels because they decompose too rapidly.
Varied reports from the literature suggest that each plant species
should be considered on its own merits and in the context of the

of how diverse the literature is on this subject. Any interpretation
of these varied results should also take into account soil type,

<H3>Effect of Green Manures on Soil Physical Condition and Crop
Performance</H3>
<P>
The authors next address two practical questions: Are green manures,
used in a field situation, capable of improving soil physical
properties in the same way that other forms of organic matter
do? And the related question: Can the use of green manures improve
crop performance?<BR>
<P>
<B>Green Manures and Soil Physical Properties.</B> The same characteristics
evaluated in the first section of this paper are also evaluated
here: aggregate distribution and stability, bulk density, moisture
content and availability, and water movement. Though limited,
the literature on green manure effects is generally consistent
with that on the effects of organic matter per se.<BR>
<P>
<B>Green Manures and Crop Performance.</B> It is an accepted fact
that improvements in soil physical condition create the potential
for increased crop growth. It is, however, difficult to assess
this relationship quantitatively, and to determine the degree
of improvement necessary to effect a significant increase in crop
yield. Researchers who have looked at corn production report that
increased corn yields are associated with improvements in the
physical condition of the soil.  Due to limitations in experimental
design, they were unable to differentiate the effect of enhanced
soil fertility from the effects of an improved physical environment.
One definitive point can be made: The benefits of green manuring
on crop yield are most apparent during dry periods, particularly
in rainfed production systems.<BR>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
The authors' conclusions focus on the need for more creative research
into the effects of green manures and soil organic matter. The
number and complexity of factors involved <FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Xerox Serif Wide">necessitates
</FONT>the use of a new approach to research, one that is scientifically-based,
and also holistic. Rather than following the traditional approach
of controlling all but the few factors to be studied, the authors
suggest that the interactions among <I>many </I>factors can be
established by systematically holding one factor constant and
measuring the effect of the green manure upon the others. These
experiments must be conducted under different climatic conditions
and over a long period of time. Though more expensive, this &quot;holistic
approach&quot; is probably the only way to fully understand the
benefits and challenges of green manuring.<BR>

<H1>Long-Term Project Breaks Ground</H1>
<P>
<I>By <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Last October's groundbreaking at UC Davis of the first 100-year
irrigated farmland research site in a Mediterranean climate anywhere
in the world was the culmination of years of preparation. Plans
began in the early 1980s when California farmers and university
personnel launched efforts to establish a statewide sustainable
agriculture research and education program, including long-term
research sites.  In 1985 the Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Act sponsored by Senator Nicholas Petris was passed,
which requested that the University of California create a sustainable
agriculture program.  The UC Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program (SAREP) was established in 1987 and is housed
on the UC Davis campus.  Additionally, the College of Agricultural
and Environmental Sciences at UCD established its own sustainable
agriculture program in 1988.<BR>
<P>
In 1989 UC SAREP sponsored a grant competition to establish a
long-term farmland research site.  A multidisciplinary team of
18 scientists headed by former UCD Agronomy and Range Science
Associate Professor <B>Kenneth Cassman</B> was awarded $150,000
in 1990 to begin its Long-term Research on Agricultural Systems
(LTRAS) experiments.  The project, which has grown to include
31 researchers, is now under the auspices of the UCD Sustainable
Agriculture Program, directed by <B>Montague Demment</B>, an agronomy
and range science associate professor. UC Davis' College of Agriculture
and Environmental Sciences is providing institutional support
to sustain the experiments for the long-term.  SAREP's public
advisory committee, which includes large- and small-scale and
conventional and organic farmers, was actively involved in the
design of the project.  Crop management guidelines and strategies
will be developed by a committee that includes both conventional
and organic farmers, the investigators, a farm supervisor and
a staff research associate.  The 300-acre experimental site is
located three miles west of the main campus on the newly acquired
1,600-acre Russell Ranch.<BR>
<H3>Beginnings</H3>
<P>
At the groundbreaking Demment lauded the efforts of the Committee
for Sustainable Agriculture, California Action Network and California
Certified Organic Farmers, which were instrumental in initiating
the sustainable agriculture legislation.  Demment also noted that
UC faculty members and administrators, including <B>William Rains</B>
of  the UCD agronomy and range science department and <B>Robert
Peyton</B>, director of the UC Office of Programs, Information
&amp; Analysis, were convinced of the importance of multidisciplinary
research to investigate the way irrigated California agriculture
has changed everything from farming practices to the weather in
the last 80 years.<BR>
<P>
Demment said the LTRAS groundbreaking represents the UCD College
of Agriculture and Environmental Science's commitment to the integration
of two parts of its mission, agricultural and environmental sciences.
 He called the LTRAS &quot;a magnet facility&quot; with the capacity
to serve as a model of balanced disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research.  &quot;This project will partly answer the question
of how to get good science from the laboratory to address problems
in the field,&quot; he said.  &quot;It will help bridge that gap.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
Demment called the LTRAS a laboratory for scientists.  It includes
fields, field maintenance and administration, and a core of data
gathered by the UCD Sustainable Agriculture Program staff. &quot;The
LTRAS provides the contextual background for disciplinary research
in a multidisciplinary setting,&quot; Demment said.  A matrix
of fundamental water, nitrogen and cropping system treatments
will be established.  Researchers will be able to examine their
specific issues in the context of the larger experiment.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We frame the large-scale question for the disciplinary scientist
by the way the experiment is set up.  The researcher can see the
breadth of systems-how ten levels of input affect a cropping system,&quot;
Demment said.<BR>
<H3>First Experiment</H3>
<P>
The first experiment on the site is a 60-acre study of annual
cropping systems and their long-term effects.  The experiment
will compare the performance of cropping systems that differ in
levels of irrigation water, nitrogen rates and sources, and cropping
diversity.  The land is prepared for a spring planting of Sudan
grass, a cover crop that will be grown for one season, then harvested
and analyzed to provide a background reading of the land's productivity.
 In the fall the first experimental winter cereal crops will be
planted.  They will be followed by Spring 1993 plantings of corn,
tomatoes and legume cover crops.  The project is described in
detail in <I>Sustainable Agriculture News, Volume 2, No. 4, Summer
1990.<BR>
</I>
<H3>Rothamsted Visit</H3>
<P>
As part of the preparation for the LTRAS start-up, Demment and
six other UCD researchers involved in the project traveled to
Southern England in the spring of 1991 to observe results and
research at Rothamsted Experimental Station, one of the most important
long-term farmland research sites in the world.  The Rothamsted
plots are examples of temperate humid sites where data on continuous
cropping have been collected since 1843.  Although continuous
cropping systems had existed before, there had never been systematic
data collection before the Rothamsted Classical Experiments.<BR>
<P>
&quot;What was exciting about Rothamsted was the strong historical
perspective of being in a place where a relatively intensive form
of agriculture has affected a country for several thousand years,&quot;
said Demment.  &quot;We also saw that it is important to start
with large plots, because as time goes on, it will become important
to divide them.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>Richard Plant</B>, professor and vice-chair in the agronomy
and range science department who specializes in agricultural systems
analysis, said visiting the Rothamsted Experimental Station gave
him a sense of history.<BR>
<P>
&quot;You have the sense that you really are in an historical
place,&quot; he said.  &quot;Often we miss that perspective of
the past.  Rothamsted is a soil museum where you can do lively
intellectual research even though many parts of the research may
be derived from archival samples.  Very often scientists work
in isolation.  It's nice to get a sense of our scientific culture.
 Rothamsted provided us with that shared heritage.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Plant said Rothamsted researchers stressed they are using information
collected over the years for purposes never dreamed of by the
site founders.  &quot;No one in 1843 could possibly have conceived
of testing soil for the effects of nuclear testing or air pollution
on agriculture,&quot; Plant said, noting that Rothamsted researchers
are doing just that.  He said the LTRAS must be planned carefully
for future researchers.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We're starting to design an experiment to collect data to
use in 100 years for scientists to solve problems we can't even
conceive of,&quot; he said.<BR>
<P>
Demment said that tests on lead deposits on Rothamsted soil underscored
the importance of extremely long-term experiments:  There were
tremendous variations in lead deposits within various time periods,
&quot;but over a period of 150<I> </I>years it was absolutely
clear that lead depositions were decreasing,&quot; he said.<BR>
<P>
&quot;There were 20-year time frames when the lead increased,&quot;
Demment said.  &quot;Shorter time frames can give clearly contradictory
trends from the 100-year pattern, especially in systems like ours
at the LTRAS which has deep soil profiles and water.  At the LTRAS,
where we're looking at the movement of materials that may take
50 years to reach groundwater, long-term studies are necessary.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Carol Shennan</B>, assistant professor of vegetable crops,
said discussions at Rothamsted emphasized the importance of collecting
exhaustive baseline data at the Davis site.  &quot;The first five
years or so are critical for defining the systems at their inception,&quot;
she said.  &quot;In particular we need to do a good job of defining
initial soil conditions.&quot;<BR>
<P>
She noted that observing the Rothamsted research operation made
it clear that these projects are more than just long-term experiments.
 &quot;We will also be developing an historical record, building
archives and having to continuously make decisions about management
modifications, and approving specific studies that will use the
site.&quot;  She noted that this requires an effective administrative
structure.  &quot;The people at Rothamsted have developed an impressive
system
<P>
for sample collection and cataloging, and for ensuring that careful
records are maintained of where measurements are made or samples
removed, to avoid problems of excessive disturbance in particular
treatments or locations,&quot; she said.<BR>
<P>
Shennan said the trip to Rothamsted brought up the issue of maintaining
the relevance of the long-term experiment to current agricultural
and societal concerns.  &quot;We need to ensure that the LTRAS
does not become fossilized.  This requires a carefully thought-out
balance between maintaining sufficient continuity for answering
long-term scientific questions, and adapting management to reflect
changes in agricultural practices over time.&quot;  She said a
combination of input from scientists, farmers and other interested
people on advisory committees will be essential.<BR>
<P>
<B>William Rains</B>, a professor of agronomy and range science
interested in nutrient cycling and plant/soil interactions, agreed
that one of the most important issues for the visiting UCD scientists
was discussion of experimental design.  &quot;We bounced ideas
around with their experimental design people, plot managers and
statisticians,&quot; he said.  &quot;That's when the real details
came out.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Rains said the Davis researchers experienced the excitement of
interdisciplinary research in their discussion with Rothamsted
scientists.  &quot;People with different disciplines asked questions,
raised points and identified issues I hadn't thought of, &quot;Rains
said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Akbar Abshahi</B>, a researcher working for the UCD Sustainable
Agriculture Program, is the manager and research coordinator of
the LTRAS, responsible for all experiments.  At Rothamsted Abshahi
was interested in soil and plant sampling, and how samples are
compared.<BR>
<P>
&quot;What are the results of planting one crop for many years
in one place?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What is the change in nutrients
in each plot?  How do both applied and naturally occurring nutrients
leach down through the soil?&quot;  Abshahi said he is interested
to see the differences that will exist between Rothamsted's unirrigated
site and the irrigated Davis plots.  Each of the 60 one-acre LTRAS
plots has been leveled, making it possible to measure exactly
how much water is used. In Rothamsted, researchers only measure
the amount of rain that falls.  UCD researchers were also impressed
with the importance of proper storage:  The first 20 years of
Rothamsted soil samples were improperly stored.<BR>
<P>
<B>Kate Scow</B>, an assistant professor in the Department of
Land, Air and Water Resources whose specialty is soil microbiology,
was surprised at Rothamsted's proximity to London, approximately
40 miles from the urban center.  &quot;You can feel the sense
of a city near the experimental site,&quot; she said.  Scow noted
that the closeness to the city underscores &quot;a new reality
about agriculture, especially in California, where the urban community
is encroaching on agricultural lands.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Scow said the College of Agriculture and Environmental Science's
support of the Davis long-term site is important for many reasons.
 &quot;It is important to tie agricultural and environmental studies.
 They are very, very closely linked.  At a place like Rothamsted,
both in studies of nitrate leaching from agricultural practices,
and studies of polyaromatic hydrocarbon accumulation from fossil
fuel combustion, you can see how agriculture is both a source
of pollution and a victim. They go together and there is a lot
you can learn about either agriculture or the environment by understanding
how they impact each other.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<B>Stuart Pettygrove</B>, a soil specialist in the land, air and
water resources department, was particularly impressed by a discussion
at Rothamsted on how to use the information the plots provide.
 &quot;We saw how they use plots that had been differentially
fertilized, then used as the basis of relatively short-term experiments,&quot;
he said.  &quot;Because different nutrient levels evolved over
135 years in the original plots, modern researchers could leverage
the information from those soils in short-term experiments (14-years)
to obtain results that would otherwise have taken a much longer
period of time.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Pettygrove said the LTRAS will eventually be able to provide such
a setting for researchers. &quot;The punchline for me was to see
the long-term plots as laboratories.  The benefit for future scientists
is not only the stored soil samples, but the fact that the soils
side-by-side in the LTRAS fields will have different nutrient
levels, but in other respects will be the same.&quot;<BR>

<H1>Insect Videotape Available<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A videotape on handling beneficial insects for the control of
agricultural pests is now available in English and Spanish. &quot;Handling
Beneficial Organisms on the Farm&quot; was produced by<B> Bob
Wise</B> of <B>Videowise </B>of Fresno, with technical information
supplied by <B>Kenneth Hagen</B> of the UC Berkeley entomology
department,<B> John Plain</B> of the Association of Applied Insect
Ecologists, and <B>Lyndon Hawkins</B> of the California Department
of Food and Agriculture. It was funded by UC SAREP. The videotape
prepares farmers for handling shipments of live beneficial insects,
making it easier for them to use these techniques on their own
farms.  To order the 28<I>-</I>minute, 1/2 inch VHS video, contact
Wise at Videowise, 2156 N. Fine, Fresno, CA 93727, (209) 251-8668.
The cost is $23.00, which includes tax, shipping and handling.

Voice in Agriculture<BR>
</H1>
<P>
In two recent issues of this newsletter (Winter, Spring 1990),
we reported on work groups formed by SAREP's Economic and Public
Policy Advisory Group. In this issue, <B>Larry Yee</B>, Ventura
County Cooperative Extension director, writes about his county's
food safety study group (page 4). <B>Debra Van Dusen</B> of the
UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program describes a recent conference
(page 8) on balancing social, environmental and economic issues
in sustainable agriculture, while <B>Dave Chaney</B> of SAREP
writes about the Rural Development Center that helps small farm
families reach economic self-sufficiency (page 10). These activities
show the public that we in the agricultural community are concerned
about their issues.
<H3>Public Role</H3>
<P>
For those of us formed in the sciences, the specter of a meddling,
uninformed public can be chilling. We honor the traditions of
great scientists of the past - Copernicus, Galileo, Darwin-whose
pursuit of truth brought them popular scorn and censure.  The
scientific method, controlled and isolated from political fray,
is the context of our enterprise. So what role does the public
play?<BR>
<P>
Hyman Rickover, an engineer and father of the modern navy, argued
that confusion between pure science and applied science leads
to a mistaken disregard for human considerations in the application
of science. We have no methods to test the safety and usefulness
of any given technology comparable to the methods used by science
to test its hypotheses. Around every field in which science is
used for human benefit, public debate is not only inevitable,
but essential. In pursuit of certain truth, science cannot regard
popular ideas, Rickover argued.<BR>
<P>
&quot;But technology is action and thus potentially dangerous.
Unless it adapts itself to human interests, needs, values, and
principles, that is unless it is humanistic, technology will do
more harm than good. For, by enlarging man's power of mind and
body, it enhances his ability to do harm, even as it enhances
his ability to do good,&quot; he wrote.<BR>
<P>
Agriculture is probably humanity's oldest technology. The application
of our knowledge of biology, chemistry, and physics has unlocked
nature's storehouse. But the instrumental use of nature to benefit
humans is coming into question today in public debates, in the
halls of legislatures, and in the voting booth. Despite the complexities
of modern life, we can still trace the threads connecting our
activities to other important patterns in the natural fabric.
<BR>
<P>
Our ability to produce food and fiber for expanding populations
will depend to a large extent on our ability to maintain the planet's
resource base. We need to develop agricultural production systems
that work in harmony with natural processes rather than disrupting
them. This will require new and different approaches, information,
and understanding. It also means that we in agriculture need to
look at our impact on the total system and make sure we consider
both human and nature's interest, values and principles. It is
not enough that we understand the technical processes of our pursuits.
We also must instruct the public in these issues so that they
can understand the options and make informed choices. Because
agriculture, like other applied sciences, must be a humane enterprise.

[<I>Editor's Note:<B> David E. Schlegel</B>, regional co-coordinator
of the federal USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
(SARE) program in the western U.S. and Plant pathologist and University
of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources administrator,
wrote this commentary for Sustainable Agriculture. UC SAREP director
<B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B> will return from sabbatic leave in July;
his commentary will return</I> <I>in the fall</I>.]<I> <BR>
</I>
<P>
In April I attended the second national IPM symposium/workshop
in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was very successful in every sense. The
conference was at tended by about 700 Agricultural Experiment
Station, Cooperative Extension and Agricultural Research Service
scientists as well as food processing company representatives,
private agricultural consultants and others from the general public.
The audience represented the cross-section of people interested
in the implications of integrated pest management for agriculture.
<BR>

<P>
The turnout was 30 percent greater than the first symposium, but
more importantly, the tone and content of many of the discussions
and posters were remarkably similar to what would be expected
at a national sustainable agriculture symposium. Indeed, on numerous
occasions reference was made to IPM strategies that are environmentally,
economically and socially acceptable. <BR>

<P>
More than 200 posters were presented, which were spectacularly
informative. Technical application was a key component of the
presentations. As I walked through the aisles of displays, I could
not help but notice that many, if not most, exemplified more systems-oriented
and interdisciplinary approaches, in sharp contrast to IPM activities
reported during the first symposium. I also saw posters displaying
projects funded by the federal sustainable agriculture initiative,
USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program,
which was authorized by Congress in the 1990 Farm Bill. <BR>

<P>
There is no question in my mind that IPM and sustainable agriculture
need to be much more closely linked. This has been one of my goals
since the beginning of the sustainable movement, but it is a slow
process. At the federal and regional levels, the USDA SARE program
has worked from the premise that pest management is a vital part
of whole farm systems and must be addressed in research and education
proposals. It has been clear to me for a very long time that these
connections should exceed simple awareness; there needs to be
joint funding for both pursuits, where appropriate. We need to
devise ways to formally link these programs at the federal level,
as well as regionally and locally, when appropriate. Integrated
pest management, however, should not be pulled entirely under
the &quot;sustainable agriculture umbrella&quot; because IPM has
activities singular to its mission. <BR>

<P>
Vice President Gore has stated that &quot;75 percent of the agricultural
land in the U.S. will be under IPM by the year 2000.&quot; The
USDA has taken this proclamation very seriously and has charged
its agencies (13 in all) to come up with a plan that provides
for coordination of the various programs. In my view this plan
must include a formal relationship with the federal USDA SARE
program, and this should set an example for similar cooperation
between state and educational programs throughout the nation.
I am optimistic about the funding picture for both sustainable
agriculture and integrated pest management, but it will be more
promising if we can devise a realistic and functional plan for
coordination and joint funding.-<I>David E. Schlegel, regional
coordinator, USDA Western SARE,</I> University of <I>California

<P>
&quot;Most agricultural regions of California enjoy long growing
seasons, fertile soils and irrigation, all conditions that favor
a highly diversified cropping.  In addition, the wide variety
of vegetables, field and tree crops determine a high diversity
and flexibility of agricultural enterprises.  Despite these factors,
Californian agroecosystems are dominated by monocultural cropping
systems.  Although productive, these systems lack the ecological
features to ensure efficient nutrient cycling, water and soil
conservation, and biotic regulation.  Productivity is subsidized
with chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers, some
of which cause undesirable environmental and public health hazards.
 Large-scale monocultures are also highly susceptible to wind
erosion and are dependent on ground water for irrigation, leading
in some areas to a considerable 'overdraft'.  In other regions,
poor field drainage and rising water tables are leading to unacceptable
soil salinity levels.  In summary, California agriculture is very
productive, but the environmental cost of such productivity is
threatening the sustainability of agriculture.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The search for self-sustaining, low-input, diversified and
energy-efficient agricultural systems is now a major concern of
researchers, farmers, policy makers and the public in California.
 The long tradition in biological pest control in California,
as well as the experience of a number of organic farmers who developed
low-input systems through 'trial and error', provide the building
blocks for the search for a more sustainable agriculture.<BR>
<P>
&quot;A key in sustainable agriculture is to restore the agricultural
landscape.  Diversity can be enhanced in time through crop rotations
and sequences, and in space in the form of cover crops, intercropping,
agroforestry crop/livestock mixtures, etc.  Vegetation diversification
not only results in pest regulation through restoration of natural
control, but also produces optimal nutrient recycling, energy
conservation and less dependence on cultural inputs.  In California,
although this new approach to agriculture is actively researched,
realistically it will work only if it is economically sensible
and can be carried out within the constraints of a fairly normal
agricultural system.  Therefore, adoptions of recommended diversification
designs will proceed  as these reduce costs and increase the efficiency
and viability of farms.&quot;<BR>

The concept of suppressive soils was described by Baker and Cook
(1 9 74) in their first book on the biological control of plant
pathogens.  This treatise described suppressiveness as the ability
of a soil to prevent, truncate or delay the development of a disease
even though favorable environmental conditions exist.  Further
research has attempted to explain the actual mechanisms of disease
suppression.  These studies have looked at the influences of various
microbial antagonists, soil fungistasis (inhibition of fungal
growth), and physical and chemical properties of soils.  Investigations
into the role of soil fauna in this process are relatively new.
<BR>

<P>
From the start, this article argues that the effect of soil fauna
on plant growth must be examined in the context of the whole microbiotic
community.  The author, therefore, puts considerable effort into
describing the members of this community, both flora and fauna,
that dwell in the rhizosphere.  A brief section highlights the
soil microflora: bacteria, actinomycetes, and the fungi.  More
detail is provided on the microfauna.  This diverse group includes
the protozoa, nematodes, and some arthropods, primarily mites
and springtails (collembola).<BR>

<H3>Organic Matter Decomposition<BR>
</H3>

<P>
In keeping with its holistic emphasis, the article examines the
relationship between flora and fauna in organic matter decomposition
and nutrient cycling before looking narrowly at plant disease.
 The author reminds us that as nematodes and protozoans feed upon
microbial populations, they consequently will affect organic matter
decomposition.  It is likely that such feeding ultimately liberates
nutrients immobilized in microbial cells or reduces competition
between microorganisms so that mineralization is actually accelerated.
 &quot; These activities not only influence the general nutrition,
health, and vigor of higher plants (which relates to disease susceptibility),
but also determine t e competitive behavior of root-infecting
fungi and their microbial antagonists.&quot; These indirect and
direct impacts are important ones for further study.<BR>

<P>
The role of microarthropods in mineralization is also discussed.
 Mites and collembola are known to fragment organic matter as
they feed on soil microflora.  This fragmentation to finer particles
creates new surface areas for microbial colonization and consequently
speeds the decomposition and mineralization processes.<BR>

<P>
Along with mineralization effects, this section of the article
describes several other interesting features of the microbiotic
community, including increased nitrogen fixation by nitrogen-fixing
bacteria <I>(Azotobacter </I>spp.<I>) </I>where protozoa are present,
and the behavior of bacterialand fungal-feeding nematodes.<BR>

<H3>Rhizosphere Effects</H3>

<P>
The rhizosphere is the soil zone surrounding and influenced by
plant roots.  To complete the picture of the microbiotic community,
the author examines the specific characteristics of the rhizosphere
that affect microflora and fauna.  The primary influences in this
zone are root exudates and the chemical and physical features
of the root-soil interface.  Root exudates and sloughed root cells
in the rhizosphere provide a rich carbon source for microbes.
 As the microbial population increases, so does the activity of
microbe-grazing fauna, leading eventually to the release of inorganic
nitrogen and phosphorus.<BR>

<P>
Root exudates can also have a strong influence on soil pathogens.
 &quot;The nutrients in exudates release dormant spores and sclerotia
from the grip of soil fungistasis, a natural phenomenon imposed
by chemical inhibitors and microbial competition for nutrients.
 Propagules fteed from fungistasis germinate and establish infection
if they are not first consumed by mycophagous [fungus-eating]
animals.  Root exudates are also important in the activation of
quiescent nematode stages and in the movement of plant parasitic
forms to infection sites.&quot;<BR>

<H3>Specific Soil Fauna-Plant Disease Relationships</H3>

<P>
This analysis of the soil fauna and the author's description of
the niche the fauna have in the rhizosphere are sufficient to
indicate that soil fauna do regulate pathogen populations to some
degree.  Investigations since 1975 have given some detail to the
actual mechanisms involved and highlight some interesting relationships.
 These are summarized in table 1.<BR>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
The studies reviewed in this paper point to the fact that the
soil microfauna play an important role in suppression of plant
pathogens and represent a significant biological control potential.
 However, there has not been adequate field testing to verify
if this biocontrol potential can be exploited in cropping systems.
 In addition, any evaluation of a candidate organism must include
the possibility of adverse effects upon plants, animals, or the
environment.  A problem with the fungal-feeding amoebae, for example,
maybe their effect on other beneficial organisms such as the mycorrhizal
fungi.  &quot;In the final analysis, efforts to manipulate and
exploit the friendly fauna populations for crop benefit must be
compatible with microbial symbionts, and other plant-growth promoting
rhizosphere organisms, and with fungi and bacteria that are being
promoted for biological control of diseases.&quot; This is clearly
an area with great opportunities for further research.<BR>

CA. 1993 <BR>

<P>
Food security in the inner city is a serious problem. The premise
of this report is that the lack of food security in inner cities
is due not just to inadequate resources, but also to inadequate
planning. This report advocates new mechanisms for food security
planning that integrate disparate actions and policies into a
comprehensive food policy. The authors start with two basic assumptions:
1) food is a basic human right; and 2) food security is a crucial
community concern. Building on these, effective food policy requires
an integrated, whole systems approach (grower to consumer) coordinated
at the municipal level. <BR>

<P>
This research project was supervised by Robert Gottlieb and Peter
Sinsheimer of the UCLA Graduate School of Urban Planning. The
project team had five objectives: 1) to evaluate the problems
of food security in the inner city from national and local contexts,
2) to assess the adequacy of the federal response to these problems,
3) to analyze how the structure of the food industry has contributed
to food insecurity, 4) to identify and evaluate community-based
strategies for change, and 5) to propose a framework for food
security planning that is equitable, economically efficient and
environmentally sound. <BR>

<H3>Methodology</H3>

<P>
This project integrated a number of disciplines, including nutrition
education, public health, hunger advocacy, economics and community
development, food retailing, agriculture, urban ecology and public
policy. The study was organized into four phases: focus, research,
publicity and advocacy. In phase one (summer/fall 1992), a series
of meetings was held with community people to clarify food access
issues and to sketch out the dimensions of the study and the complexity
of the food network. <BR>

<P>
In phase two, extensive research and analysis of the food system
was done with an emphasis on the local level. More than 1,000
policy, industry and academic documents were reviewed and more
than 200 interviews were conducted. The research involved assessments
of the food system at the local, the regional and the state/national
levels. At the <B>local level,</B> a comprehensive case study
was done of a 2-square mile area in South Central Los Angeles.
At the <B>regional level,</B> studies were done of the location
of supermarkets over time, of consumers and growers at farmers'
markets in the county, of low-income community gardeners, and
of the structure of the food retailing industry from the grower
to the store. The study also evaluated urban agriculture programs,
land use in the region, policy and local government activities
and transportation routes. At the <B>state and national</B> <B>level,</B>
the project reviewed food support programs, analyzed eight Food
Policy Council initiatives in the U.S. and Canada, examined the
public health literature on nutrition and food security issues,
did an analysis of the supermarket industry over the past decades,
and reviewed community development initiatives with regard to
new supermarket investments. <BR>

<P>
In the third phase, all of the research was synthesized and the
report was written. The fourth phase will include dissemination
of the report and the development of an implementation strategy
based on the reports recommendations.<BR>

<H3>Key Findings</H3>

<P>
The report summarizes its findings in five key areas: hunger and
nutrition, the food retail industry, transportation, alternative
food strategies and policy. <BR>

<P>
<B>Hunger and nutrition</B>. Hunger and nutrition are substantial
problems in the inner city. The project's survey found that 27
percent of residents of a South Central L.A. neighborhood did
not have enough money to buy food. The emergency food network
was overwhelmed, with the amount of food distributed increasing
from 25 million pounds in 1979 to over 450 million pounds in 1990.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Food retail industry</B>. The food retail industry has abandoned
the inner city. Recent supermarket investments are driven by the
market and not community needs. The industry has not adequately
examined creative solutions to improve communities. <BR>

<P>
<B>Transportation</B>. There is a lack of adequate transportation
in the inner city. Thirty-eight percent of the households surveyed
in the case study area do not have cars and three out of ten people
surveyed have problems bringing home large amounts of groceries.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Alternative food strategies</B>. There is much interest among
consumers in urban agriculture programs. Sixty-eight percent of
those surveyed in the case study area reported interest in participating
in a community gardening program in their neighborhood. Urban
agriculture provides significant economic and community development
possibilities but receives very little municipal support. A 64-square-foot
plot can save a family up to $600 in food purchases per year.
Farmers' markets can also provide tangible social and economic
benefits to communities; 83 percent of the farmers' market growers
surveyed reported economic benefits from participating in farmers'
markets. <BR>

<P>
<B>Policy</B>. There is no overall food policy in Los Angeles
City ox County. This situation has hindered the development of
an adequate food delivery system, and created inefficiencies and
inequities in the food distribution system. <BR>

<H3>Recommendations</H3>

<P>
The report concludes with a range of new initiatives and strategies
based on its findings. They include both substantive and procedural
actions to provide a basis for planning for food security. <BR>

<OL>
<LI>One of the project's primary recommendations is for Los Angeles
to establish a Food Policy and Planning Council with the vision
to develop and integrate food policies at the municipal, regional
and state levels. At the national level, the report suggests that
the USDA integrate food policy councils and urban food system
initiatives across the country. 
<LI>Increased funding should be directed to federal and state
food assistance and nutrition education programs. 
<LI>The supermarket industry should establish joint ventures for
community participation in inner city markets. The Food Policy
Council could create incentives for supermarkets to participate
in these ventures. 
<LI>Transportation planning should be part of planning for the
food needs of the community. The Food Policy Council should develop
a transportation plan that integrates transportation routes with
food distribution outlets. 
<LI>More local and state support should be directed toward farmers'
markets, the WIC Farmers' Market Program, a statewide direct marketing
program, and urban agriculture. The Food Policy Council could
help coordinate urban agriculture and farmers market programs.
They could also provide technical support for urban agriculture
projects. 
</OL>

<P>

<P>
The report ends with a &quot;Call to Action.&quot; The authors
suggest that with the Clinton administration, Los Angeles and
the nation are politically ripe for a new food policy. In addition,
economic forces are pushing supermarkets to reinvest in the inner
city. This influx of political and economic capital could provide
the encouragement needed to address the urgent food security needs
of urban areas. <BR>

<P><B>A Cooperative Approach to Adapting Nonpoint Source Pollution Guidelines
to Local COnditions</B> </P>

<P><I>by Ellen Rilla, UC Cooperative Extension director, Marin/Sonoma counties,
and Stephanie Larson, UC Cooperative Extension livestock and range management
advisor, Marin/Sonoma counties</I> </P>

<P><I>(Editor's Note: This is the first part of a two-part article on the
Marin Coastal Watershed Enhancement Project, which was coordinated by Ellen
Rilla and Stephanie Larson, and involved the work of many individuals in
UC Cooperative Extension, the agricultural community, natural resources
agencies, and environmental groups. Funding for the project was provided
by the Marin Community Foundation.)</I> </P>

<P>he condition of riparian habitat in coastal Marin County has deteriorated
significantly since the early part of this century. Agricultural practices
are often cited as a primary cause of this habitat degradation. Public
perceptions of agricultural practices and resultant criticism of agriculturists
have polarized community factions and hindered cooperation in solving resource
management problems. Some agricultural practices have undoubtedly contributed
to resource degradation, but management is highly varied, and there are
numerous examples of sound resource management on agricultural land in
coastal Marin County. </P>

<P>Though agricultural management practices have greatly improved over
the last 20 years, the viability of agriculture is threatened by an increasingly
restrictive regulatory environment. In response to recent amendments to
federal water quality laws, Regional Water Quality Control Boards will
begin regulating nonpoint source (NPS) pollution on rangelands unless landowners
take voluntary steps to improve water quality. </P>

<P>Several watershed enhancement programs have been conducted in coastal
Marin County since the early 1980s. Despite the benefits of these projects,
they have primarily focused on repair of localized erosion problems, and
they have not significantly affected agricultural management practices.
</P>

<H3>Project Goals </H3>

<P>The Marin Coastal Watershed Enhancement Project was designed to address
the issue of NPS pollution on a local level. A primary focus of the project
is to provide landowners with the resources that they need to demonstrate
cooperative, voluntary compliance with water quality regulations. This
approach will minimize regulatory involvement in local land management.
</P>

<P>Project goals include improving water quality, fish habitat, and natural
resources in western Marin County through voluntary adoption of appropriate
management practices. Specific objectives of the project include helping
landowners identify water quality problems, demonstrating existing examples
of good management, providing information on management practices that
maintain or improve water quality, and assisting with monitoring programs.
</P>

<P>This two-year project was funded by the Marin Community Foundation,
a local private foundation, between approximately March 1994 and March
1996. The Foundation was interested in funding a project that would bring
stakeholders together for cooperative watershed enhancement, addressing
their goals in the areas of environmental quality and land conservation.
</P>

<H3>Nonpoint Source Pollution</H3>

<P>Pollution is defined in the California State Water Code as &quot;an
alteration of the quality of the state waters by waste to a degree which
unreasonably affects either of the following: (1) The waters for beneficial
uses; (2) Facilities which serve these beneficial uses.&quot; The Federal
Clean Water Act (CWA) identifies categories of pollution as either point
source or nonpoint source. Point source pollution is an observable, specific,
and confined discharge of pollutants into a water body. Examples of this
kind of pollution include dairy waste ponds, food processing plants, and
agrochemical processing plants. In contrast, NPS pollution consists of
diffuse discharges of pollutants throughout the natural environment. </P>

<P>Nonpoint sources of pollution, including erosion, and, to a lesser degree,
animal nutrient production, occur naturally at certain levels. However,
common management practices increase these types of pollution. Nonpoint
source pollution from rangelands can be exacerbated by grazing, road building,
mining and recreational activities. Grazing can be a source of excessive
sediment, nutrients, and pathogens. Animal concentration in riparian areas
allows the direct deposition of nutrients and pathogens in waterways, and
can cause streambank erosion and sedimentation. </P>

<P>Statewide and nationwide, sediment is considered to be the primary nonpoint
pollution source on rangelands. However, in Marin County, because of the
high concentration of livestock on dairies, animal waste is the greatest
pollution concern from both point and nonpoint sources. Pollution of Tomales
Bay by dairy waste has increasingly become a focus of public concern because
of its presumed negative effect on shellfish production, a $2 million dollar
industry operating in Tomales Bay. </P>

<H3>Project Area </H3>

<P><IMG SRC="group.gif" ALT="Image: Break-out group" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 HEIGHT=285 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=RIGHT>The
project area encompasses the watersheds of three major coastal streams
north of San Francisco, within Marin County. These include Walker Creek,
Lagunitas Creek, and numerous smaller tributaries to Tomales Bay and the
Marin County portion of Stemple Creek/Estero de San Antonio, which flows
into Bodega Bay. </P>

<P>The watersheds encompass approximately 232 sq. miles, or 148,480 acres,
primarily in agricultural ownership. The Lagunitas Creek watershed is unique,
with an estimated run of 500 Coho salmon documented, or ten percent of
the state's current Coho population. The Walker Creek watershed drains
into Tomales Bay, one of the prime remaining estuaries on the west coast.
It is also listed as an impaired waterbody by the State Water Quality Control
Board. Stemple Creek becomes the Estero de San Antonio, and is part of
the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. Federal lands within
the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA) and the Point Reyes National
Seashore fall within the project area boundaries. These federal lands were
not specifically addressed by the project at the onset, though park service
staff actively participated in landowner outreach and education. With the
change in park superintendents midway through the project, the boundaries
of the study were expanded to include the park lands encompassing Olema
Creek. The project area also encompasses proposed federal legislation which
seeks to expand the seashore park boundaries by 38,000 acres by purchasing
development rights from willing landowners. </P>

<P>The predominant agricultural use is characterized by dairy, sheep, and
cattle operations ($40 million/year) interspersed with small commercial
horse operations in rural residential settings. Conservation easements
exist on 25,000 acres due to an aggressive campaign by the local Marin
Agricultural Land Trust. </P>

<H3>Regulatory Agencies</H3>

<P>Laws regulating NPS pollution have been in existence since 1977, but
until recently, regulatory agencies have focused on controlling point sources
of pollution. </P>

<P>In California planning and enforcement authority for NPS pollution is
passed from the EPA, to the State Water Resources Control Board (State
Water Board), then down to the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards.
In 1988, the State Water Board produced a nonpoint source management plan
for the State of California. This plan outlines three management approaches
for addressing NPS pollution problems. This is commonly referred to as
the &quot;three tiered&quot; approach, where each enforcement tier increasingly
emphasizes regulation. Tier One is described as &quot;Voluntary Implementation
of Best Management Practices,&quot; and encourages landowners to utilize
available technical assistance to voluntarily assess and improve management
practices that effect water quality. Tiers Two and Three involve enforcement
actions from the Regional Board. </P>

<P>The Nonpoint Source Management Plan did not adequately address some
nonpoint sources, and it is currently being amended. This process includes
preparation of a rangeland grazing plan for California. The rangeland grazing
plan will specify a strategy for either individual landowners or watershed
management groups to address NPS <BR>
pollution on rangelands. This proposed strategy utilizes Tier One compliance
and is based on the assumption that, if landowners demonstrate a significant
effort to reduce water pollution through voluntary measures, enforcement
will not be necessary. The primary element of this strategy is preparation
of water quality management plans by all rangeland owners or operators.
</P>

<P>The deadline for the State Water Quality Control Board to have a nonpoint
source management plan that complies with federal water pollution laws
was July 1995. There will be an eight-year time frame for implementation
of this plan. By 2003, landowners will be expected to have significantly
reduced NPS pollution through voluntary compliance. </P>

<H3>Agency/Community Involvement</H3>

<P>An important aspect of the project is the cooperative effort of local
government agencies and private support groups working together as a team
to assist landowners with NPS pollution issues. Participating groups include
the University of California Cooperative Extension, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, National Park Service, and
the Marin County Resource Conservation District. To ensure that the project
is practical and meets the needs of agriculturists, a local sheep and beef
producer was hired to help with landowner outreach. </P>

<P>A team of six staff from these groups provide day-to-day project orchestration.
This team approach eliminates program duplication, and the coordination
of efforts assures efficient flow of information between regulatory agencies
and land owners. </P>

<P>A thirty member advisory committee, made up of community representatives,
producer groups (from shellfish growers to dairy operators), regulatory
and resource agencies, and environmental organizations provides general
guidance and oversight. The committee met at the onset of the project to
discuss and amend project goals and objectives. Members are kept up-to-date
on project progress with informational memos between meetings. Initial
interviews were conducted with members prior to the project start-up as
a partial assessment of their views of the problem, potential solutions
and possible pitfalls. </P>

<P><I>(Part 2 of &quot;Marin Coastal Watershed Project,&quot; which includes
descriptions of landowner outreach, local compliance, and next steps, will
appear in Vol. 8, No. 4, Fall 1996 of Sustainable Agriculture. See &quot;Marin

<P>
Thirty-six research and education projects have been granted a
total of $203,430 by UC SAREP in the 1995/96 funding cycle, according
to <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B>, SAREP director. New projects were chosen
in four different areas: community development and public policy,
production, educational events, and graduate student awards. A
brief description of the projects, principal investigators and
amounts awarded for the first year follows.<BR>

<A NAME="community"></A><H3>Community Development and Public Policy Projects<BR>
(6 Projects; $51,699)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Patricia Allen</B> and <B>Jackelyn Lundy</B>, Center for
Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, UC Santa Cruz, &quot;Food
Security in Santa Cruz, California: Building a Foundation for
Community Action&quot;: $8,560. This project will focus on the
city of Santa Cruz and its issues of food security, which means
the ability of community members to have a secure, culturally
acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through local non-emergency
sources within a viable, environmentally sound agricultural system.
This will be addressed by research, policy analysis, community
networking and publications to support the development of a local
food policy council. Guided by an advisory committee of local
stakeholders and food policy experts, the investigators will prepare
a report on food security in Santa Cruz, including who is most
at risk nutritionally and why.
<P><LI><B>Joyce M. Ewen</B>, Pomona-Inland Valley Council of Churches,
&quot;PIVCC's Food Security Project&quot;: $5,000. This project
will increase food security by building the capacity of a low-income
neighborhood to produce its own food, increase knowledge and practice
of good nutrition, and expand accessibility of fresh, locally
grown food. The collaborative project will link several key organizations
to create solutions for hunger issues and long-term food security.
<P><LI><B>Santos Gomez</B>, Pacific Institute for Studies in Development,
Environment and Security, &quot;Using Water Transfers to Promote
Sustainable Rural Development&quot;: $11,000. This project will
determine the conditions under which water transfers can promote
the health and sustainability of rural communities. Working collaboratively
with farmer and farmworker organizations, rural community leaders,
and other researchers, the investigators will determine where
water transfers could generate significant positive or negative
impacts and identify policy alternatives for water transfers that
encourage sustainable rural development.
<P><LI><B>Robert Gottlieb</B>, Urban Planning, UCLA, &quot;Expanding
Direct Marketing Opportunities for Community Development and to
Reduce Pesticide Use&quot;: $10,139. This continuing project will
complete a feasibility study of a &quot;Market Basket&quot; program
in which farmers who sell at farmers' markets use a new marketing
arrangement resembling community supported agriculture. Demonstration
projects will be launched in two low- and middle- income communities
with large minority populations, one in Southwest and one in East
Los Angeles.
<P><LI><B>Sharon Junge</B>, Placer County Cooperative Extension Office,
&quot;Impacts of Local Food Systems on Communities and Agriculture/Reason
for the Seasons...Increasing Sustainable Practices Among Consumers&quot;:
$10,000. This continuing project is encouraging greater purchasing
and production of local agricultural products to create a more
stable and sustainable community. The investigators are working
with a grassroots agricultural marketing association, PlacerGROWN,
to educate consumers on the benefits of purchasing locally produced,
processed and distributed food that is geared to seasonal availability.
<P><LI><B>Sibella Kraus</B>, Center for Urban Education about Sustainable
Agriculture, &quot;Market Cooking for Kids: Developing Children's
Consciousness of Regional Sustainable Agriculture&quot;: $7,000.
This project is an innovative cooking and science program for
children in Bay Area public schools which combines hands-on education
about the biology and production of local seasonal foods with
basic cooking instruction about how to appreciate and prepare
these foods. The program will reach almost 500 children, primarily
from low-income backgrounds and will be a year-long collaborative
effort among the school district, restaurants, produce businesses,
farmers' markets, and regional farms.
</UL>

<P>

<A NAME="production"></A><H3>Production Projects<BR>
(11 projects; $128,481)</H3>

<UL>
<P><LI><B>Roger Ingram</B>, Placer-Nevada counties farm advisor,
&quot;Controlled Grazing on Foothill Rangelands&quot;: $21,500.
This project will address the expressed needs of Northern California
livestock producers for research-based information on controlled
grazing and sustainable livestock production practices. It will
also demonstrate how land owners and ranchers can monitor the
effects of these practices so they can decide for themselves whether
controlled grazing is appropriate for their business. The project
will also address public concerns about the environmental impacts
of grazing.
<P><LI><B>Rob Atwill</B>, UC Davis Veterinary Medicine Teaching and
Research Center, Tulare CA, &quot;Assessing the Environmental
Risk from Rangeland Cattle Shedding Cryptosporidium parvum in
their Feces&quot;: $7,966. Large municipal water-borne outbreaks
of Cryptosporidium-induced gastroenteritis in humans has raised
questions among ranchers, government regulators and watershed
managers as to whether cattle grazing is a leading source of this
pathogen and how best to equitably minimize its possible impacts.
This project will determine whether and under what conditions
eggs of the pathogen shed in the feces of rangeland beef cattle
can survive the ambient temperatures typical of California rangeland
from spring through fall.
<IMG SRC = "IMG00001.GIF" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5>
<P><LI><B>Larry Forero</B>, Shasta-Trinity counties farm advisor,
&quot;History of Livestock Grazing on the Shasta-Trinity Forest:
Implications for the Future&quot;: $5,000. Historical documents
indicate that livestock grazing in Shasta, Siskiyou, and Trinity
counties has decreased from 90,000 animal unit months (aum: amount
one cow with a calf eats per month) during the 1930s to about
9,400 currently. This study will reconstruct the history of grazing
in the Shasta Trinity National Forest and determine the causes
for this reduction of grazing activity. The data could be used
to demonstrate how reduction in livestock grazing on public land
translates to private land use decisions.
<P><LI><B>Bruce Jaffee</B>, Nematology, UC Davis, &quot;Suppression
of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes in Conventional and Organic Farming
Systems&quot;: $9,000. This is the second year of a study in which
soils from conventional and organic farming systems are being
examined for their suppressiveness to plant-parasitic nematodes.
The project will be conducted at the Sustainable Agriculture Farming
Systems project at UC Davis.
<P><LI><B>Steve Temple</B>, Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;A Comparison of Conventional, Low Input and Organic Farming
Systems: The Transition Phase and Long-Term Viability&quot;: $37,500.
The <A HREF="http://agronomy.ucdavis.edu/safs/">Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems</A>
 project at UC Davis,
now in its eighth year, compares four farming systems with varying
levels of dependence on external resources over a 12-year period.
<P><LI><B>Ford Denison</B>, Agronomy and Range Science, UC Davis,
&quot;Rotation Length and Organic Transitions&quot;: $7,000. An
additional four-year organic rotation was added last year to the
Long Term Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) project at
UC Davis. SAREP provided the start-up money for this 100-year
long-term farmland research experiment in 1990. This part of the
LTRAS project will continue to evaluate two-year and four-year
rotation length and will assess the contributions of soil quality
and human factors in the transition to organic farming.
<P><LI><B>Steven Koike</B>, Monterey County farm advisor, &quot;Determination
of the Effect of Cover Crops on Lettuce Drop Disease&quot;: $3,540.
This is the second year of a study that will determine the ability
of cover crop residues to reduce lettuce drop disease. Another
objective of the study is to determine the effects of compost
on populations of the lettuce drop pathogen.
<P><LI><B>Krishna Subbarao</B>, Plant Pathology Specialist, U.S.
Agricultural Research Station, Salinas, &quot;Subsurface Drip
Irrigation for Soilborne Disease Management in Lettuce&quot;:
$8,000. In the first year of this study, the use of subsurface
drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation was shown to reduce
the incidence of lettuce drop and the severity of corky root,
two serious diseases of lettuce in the Salinas Valley. Also, yields
were higher under drip irrigation. The second year of the study
will continue with the same objectives to verify the results and
will include fungicide-sprayed vs. unsprayed subplots.
<P><LI><B>Jay Rosenheim</B>, Entomology, UC Davis, &quot;Ecology
of a Group of Generalist Predators, the Green Lacewings, and their
Contribution to Biological Control in Almonds and Walnuts&quot;:
$8,000. This project seeks to develop an improved understanding
of the ecology of green lacewings, one of the dominant groups
of generalist predators in almonds and walnuts. The research will
evaluate whether releases have the potential to substantially
augment natural populations, and will determine the optimum timing
and developmental stage of release.
<P><LI><B>Marita Cantwell</B>, Vegetable Crops, UC Davis, &quot;Alternative
Postharvest Treatments for Decay and Insect Control&quot;: $13,000.
Consumer demand for pesticide-free produce is increasing while
consumers also continue to expect insect-free and decay-free products.
This project will evaluate the two important benign postharvest
treatments, high carbon dioxide atmospheres and heat therapy,
for their effects on decay and insect control on grapes, pears,
leafy greens, tomatoes, and peppers.
<P><LI><B>Michael Costello</B>, Fresno County farm advisor, &quot;Fostering
Transition toward Balanced Predator/Prey Mite Populations in Vineyards
Using Narrow Range Summer Oil&quot;: $7,975. While the most frequently
applied pesticide for Pacific mite on grapes is effective, it
has a 30-day reentry period and is scheduled for cancellation
due to regulatory changes. This project will evaluate the effects
of narrow range summer oil, which has a 12-hour reentry period,
on Pacific mite and predator mite populations in comparison with
the standard mite treatment.

<H1>North Coast Organic Winegrape Workshop<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Editor's note: <I>UC SAREP has worked with Cooperative Extension
on several grape conferences (see &quot;Visalia Conference Addresses
Reduced Inputs in Grapes&quot;, </I><B>Sustainable Agriculture
News</B> <I>Vol.1, Number 2 and &quot;500 Attend Low-Input Grape
Meetings&quot; in Vol. 2</I> <I>Number 2.) A recent industry-sponsored
workshop in Healdsburg also provided information of interest to
growers, farm advisors and researchers.<BR>
</I>
<P>
&quot;Organic Farming of Winegrapes: Is Organic the Way of the
Nineties?&quot; was the question of the day and the subject of
a February 21 seminar in Healdsburg sponsored by the California
North Coast Grape Growers Association of Ukiah. The sold-out meeting
drew 155 people. <B>Charlie Barra</B>, an organic grape grower
in Redwood Valley, was the session moderator.
<H3>Hardy Character</H3>
<P>
<B>Brian Fitzpatrick</B>, of Fitzpatrick Winery and Lodge in El
Dorado County, began by asking the rhetorical question &quot;Can
premium winegrapes be grown organically?&quot; According to Fitzpatrick,
the answer may be both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot; The
nitrogen needs of winegrapes are quite low, cosmetic appearance
is not important, and grapes have an overall &quot;hardy and thrifty
character,&quot; which makes them one of the easiest crops to
grow organically, he said.  Growing grapes organically will be
very difficult, however, if the grower has not carefully considered
site and variety selection, which can drastically affect disease
management, Fitzpatrick said. Weeds and persistent pest imbalances
may wreak havoc for some, he said. Fitzpatrick emphasized, though,
that many problems may be overcome by proper canopy management
to increase airflow, pruning to manage annual crop loads, cover
cropping to control weeds and to increase the diversity of predators,
and improving soil fertility. He discussed the legal definitions
of organic grapes, noting that there is a difference between wines
that contain <I>organically grown </I>grapes, and <I>organic wines
</I>that do not contain sulfites or synthetic acids. Most wines
containing organically grown grapes are not organic wines.
<H3>Vineyard diversity</H3>
<P>
Ron Bartolucci, general manager of vineyard operations at Fetzer
Vineyards in Redwood Valley, said his winery has attempted to
eliminate pesticides for many years, but the decision to grow
organically was made for three reasons: 1) the potential to produce
a &quot;better grape,&quot; 2) concern about natural resources,
and 3) the trend in legislation toward reduction or elimination
of pesticides. Bartolucci stressed the need for diversity in the
vineyard ecosystem to improve the habitat for predators. He said
&quot;we must view the whole system, and not make decisions on
individual parts.&quot; He noted that cover crops can improve
soil fertility and microbial activity, provide an excellent source
of organic matter, choke out weeds, open up the soil to improve
aeration and soil moisture, and provide nectar for predators.
He said several cover crop experiments are underway at Fetzer,
including mowing at different levels of maturity, and green manuring
trials.<BR>
<P>
<B>Will Dennison</B>, of Dennison Vineyards in Boonville reminded
the audience that the concept of organic farming is very old,
and that current problems may be solved with old solutions.
<H3>Gradual conversion</H3>
<P>
The discussion of organic grape growing was continued by <B>Dennis
Bowker</B>, vineyard manager of Hayward Winery in Sonoma. He said
there are several levels in the transition to organic farming
practices, and recommended that the process be a gradual conversion.
He said that frequently his biggest problem is surrounding growers
who use disruptive pesticides. Mildew remains a major problem
for which there is no promising solution. Organic growers use
sulfur for mildew control, which requires relatively large amounts
of energy to produce, he said.
<H3>Why organic?</H3>
<P>
An extended question and answer period produced the following
exchanges: W<I>hat is the best way to convert from conventional
to organic practices? </I>Diligent integrated pest management
practices should be used in the transition, using the least disruptive
insecticides when control is required. Non-disruptive spraying
techniques might include using low rates, spraying only every
other row, using low volume spraying, and avoiding the use of
broad spectrum insecticides. <I>Is there a monetary advantage
in growing organically? </I>To date, there is no price premium
for organic wines or wines made from organically grown grapes.
The increased demand however, may eventually result in a higher
price. <I>Then why grow organically, since it can be more expensive?
</I>Consumption of alcohol worldwide is decreasing, and survival
of California vineyards may mean keeping up with the times; furthermore,
price is primarily related to quality, and organically grown grapes
are believed to have excellent quality.<BR>

<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Berseem clover is an erect-growing, non-reseeding annual legume with oblong, slightly hairy leaflets lacking a watermark.  It has hollow stems and a short taproot; flowers are yellowish white, self-sterile, and clustered in dense elliptical heads about 1 in long; and each floret produces one roughly-spherical yellow seed (Graves et al. 1987).  The landrace 'Saidi' tends to be decumbent rather than erect (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>According to Knight (1985), the wild parent of berseem clover has apparently become extinct; however, Duke (1981) suggests that <I>Trifolium berytheum</I></B> Boiss. & Bl., native to Israel, Lebanon, and Syria and fully interfertile with berseem, may be the wild progenitor.  Egyptian landraces of berseem clover include Miscawi, Saidi, and Fahl (Graves et al., 1989).  Kennedy and Mackie (1925) reported that there are four distinct agricultural varieties of berseem clover grown in various localities and differing in rapidity of growth, number of cuttings per season, height of plant, and amount and method of irrigation required.  They are Miskawi, Khadrawi, Saidi and Fahl.<P> Miskawi (Muscowi U.S.D.A.) is the variety most commonly grown in Egypt.  It is preferred in the delta region of lower Egypt where there is an abundance of water for winter irrigation but none in summer.  It is a basal or crown-branching type and can be cut 5 or 6 times during its life (Graves et al., 1989).<P> Kennedy and Mackie (1925) mention that Khadrawi (Kadrawi U.S.D.A.) resembles Miskawi in habit of growth but requires more water.  It is said to have a longer vegetative period and heavier yield.<P> Saidi (Saida U.S.D.A.) is characterized by having a long root system which enables it to withstand drought.  It is somewhat intermediate in growth between Miskawi and Fahl.  This variety is the berseem of upper Egypt; it grown on the basin lands and sown in the mud after the Nile flood.  Saidi branches both basally and on the stems and can be cut two or 3 times (Graves et al., 1989).<P> Kennedy and Mackie (1925) state that Fahl (Fachl U.S.D.A.) is used where water is not available after sowing and where the land is to be used immediately after cutting the crop.  The land is overflowed by the Nile during the autumn months and when the water subsides a layer of mud is deposited.  The seed is sown in the mud.  No further irrigation is given and only one cutting of green fodder is obtained.  'Fahl' is a stem-branching type and can be cut only once (Graves et al., 1989).<P> The two varieties commercially available in California are 'Multicut' and 'Bigbee.' Other varieties include 'Fahl' (single cut), 'Miscawi' (Egypt), 'Sacromonte,' and "Tunisian common" (Graves et al., 1987).  'Multicut' has the best growth rate in the Central Valley and irrigated desert valleys of southern California. 'Bigbee,' a variety from the southern U.S., grows more slowly than 'Multicut' but is more winter hardy (Miller et al.  1989).  In general, cultivars of berseem clover that exhibit basal branching (e.g., 'Miscawi', 'Bigbee', 'Multicut') can regrow from repeated cuttings (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Seed production is abundant (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925; Graves et al., 1987) with 1500 kg of seed per hectare produced in a 1987 foundation seed field.  Very little is hard seed (Graves et al., 1989).  Unlike alfalfa, the most vigorous berseem produces the best and heaviest crops of seed.  One field of soft soil in the Imperial Valley produced seed at the rate of 792 lbs/acre, but less than half of this amount was secured from the heavy soils of the Experiment Station (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  In Egypt, the average yield of seed for 'Miskawi' (1925) was 360 lbs/acre (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>The multiple-cut varieties can be harvested 5 or 6 times at four week intervals from January or February until June or July.  The first three cuttings are made in the vegetative stage while the later harvests are made during bloom beginning in May (Graves et al., 1987).<P> Mowing when the plants are about 9 inches high causes new shoots to initiate.  For early-sown berseem this cutting should be made about the first of January.  40 or 50 days later, the second cutting may be made.  If no seed production is desired, three more harvests may be made by June 1st when the hot weather usually curtails growth.  When seed is desired, only three cuttings are made.  Seed should be ready for harvest after the first week in June.  When berseem is grown on soft soil under favorable conditions, it should be cut every 30 days after about the first of February at which time it should be about 24 inches in height. Before cutting, basal shoots will already have been initiated (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P> Mowing is scheduled when the plants attain 16 inches or the basal sprouts are 2 to 3 inches long.  The harvesting of small areas may be done with a garden-type tractor with a front sicklebar attachment.  Larger fields are usually cut with a greenchop windrower or rear-mounted tractor sicklebar attachment (Graves and Munoz, 1986).  In favorable years, early-sown 'Miskawi' can sustain its first cutting in fifty days.  If conditions are less favorable, it may take seventy days (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Berseem roots do not extend as deeply into the soil as those of alfalfa but are mainly restricted to the first two feet; however, 'Saidi' has "a long root system" according to Kennedy and Mackie (1925).  The species is mentioned as having a short taproot (Graves et al., 1987).  Inoculation of berseem clover seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD accelerated the development of nodules.  There was also, according to Yahalom et al. (1989), an increase in root surface area and nutrient uptake.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Fertilizer needs of berseem clover are similar to those of alfalfa (Graves et al., 1987).  Phosphate fertilizer and sometime sulphate is needed.  Single super phosphate (0-25-0-10) applied yearly at 200 kg/ha (200 kg/ha x $200/ton = $40/ha) will normally provide this need (Graves and Munoz, 1987).  Because San Diego County soils are usually deficient in phosphorus, spread 200 to 500 lbs/acre of single super phosphate (0-25-0) before soil preparation (Graves and Munoz, 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Kennedy and Mackie (1925) stated that berseem is tolerant of salinity or alkalinity and used in reclamation of "salty" land in Egypt.  Graves et al. (1987) stated that it tolerates moderate salinity.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>In general, fall-seeded berseem clover flowers from April through May (Duke, 1981).  'Multicut' bloomed ten days later than Bigbee (Graves et al., 1987)<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Bugg et al.  (1990) found that cv 'Bigbee' reached a height of 23.97 +/- 1.26 inches (mean +/- S.E.M.) in southern Georgia, and Graves et al.  (1987) mention that 'Multicut' is taller than 'Bigbee.' Miller et al.  (1989) state that berseem will reach a height of 18 inches, whereas in Arizona, berseem clover can attain 95-105 cm (about 37 to 41 inches) (Knight, 1985).  'Miskawi' is a rank grower sometimes attaining a height of five feet (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  Cv 'Multicut' reached 57.15 +/- 3.20 cm (mean +/- SEM) in a Mendocino Co. vineyard (Bugg, unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Once established berseem will grow vigorously and reach a height of 18 inches by the end of January (Miller et al., 1989).  A crop may be matured from early sown berseem (Sept.- Oct.) in 50 days from seeding while late sown (Nov.-Dec.) may require 70 to 90 days to produce the first crop (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  Seed set of fall-seeded berseem occurs during June (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>The seedbed should be well worked and firm, much like that used for seeding alfalfa.  This usually consists of a discing or plowing, harrowing to break up the soil clods and floating the surface with a drag.  Broadcast the inoculated seed on this smooth seedbed and cover lightly with a chain drag and firm the seedbed with a cultipacker roller (Graves and Munoz, 1986). Cultipacking ensures better seed-to-soil contact and moisture conservation (Zahradnik, 1985).<P> On heavy soils not so well adapted to berseem, the stand and subsequent growth is much improved by corrugating the surface in the direction of the flowing water.  In this manner, the whole of the soil is sub-irrigated or saturated by capillarity, avoiding the detrimental effects of flooding.  These corrugations are only 4 or 5 inches high, and offer no obstacle to the mower (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>On heavy, infertile soil of the Imperial Valley Experiment Station, berseem yielded 10 to 12 tons of green fodder to the acre in addition to a crop of seed.  Soft soil near El Centro produced in four crops of berseem 23.5 tons of green feed to the acre by April 16 after which a seed crop of 792 lbs/acre was harvested (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  'Multicut' berseem germplasm out- performed annual ryegrass, a commonly used winter and spring forage grass, during four years of field testing under supplemental irrigation in the Central Valley (Morey and Marchant, 1977).<P> According to Graves and Munoz (1986), the following production schedule can be obtained with a September 15 seeding in San 
Diego County:<P>

'Bigbee' can yield up to 4 tons/acre.
</PRE>

 In Mississippi State University tests, 'Bigbee' ranked first out of 20 clovers, including 'Tibbee' crimson and 'Yuchi' arrowleaf, producing slightly more than 4 tons of dry matter per acre in three cuttings (Zahradnik, 1985). Cv 'Burton' (now called 'Multicut') consistently outperformed other varieties and strains over four years of trials in the Central Valley of California, under supplemental irrigation.  Yields ranged from 11,000 to 14,100 lbs of dry matter/acre, averaging 13,300 lbs (Morey and Marchant, 1977).  Graves et al. (1987) found in field trials that 'Multicut' produced up to 14,000 lbs/acre dry matter and that 'Bigbee' suffered a yield disadvantage compared to 'Multicut' of 10 to 50% in field trials.  'Multicut' also produced more winter forage than 'Bigbee.' Biomass harvests were made on May 15-16, 1991 for cover crops seeded during October, 1990, in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Dry above-ground biomass for 'Bigbee' was 8.463+/-0.803 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M. When weed biomass was added, the sum was 8.630+/-0.713 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data)<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>During 1925, seed was obtained commercially in Imperial Valley, Australia, and Egypt (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925). 'Multicut': Breeder seed will be maintained by the Dept.  of A&RS, U.C.  Davis. Foundation seed can be obtained from the Foundation and Plant Materials Service, Parsons Seed Certification Center, UC Davis. Adequate quantities of foundation and certified seed were available for autumn planting in 1989 (Graves et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Kennedy and Mackie (1925) stated that no fungal pests of berseem were known, but Duke (1981) listed 12 fungi, 2 bacteria, 1 virus (cucumber mosaic), 2 parasitic plants, and 12 types of plant parasitic nematodes as being associated with berseem.  Duke (1981) mentions berseem as tolerant of virus.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Kennedy and Mackie (1925) stated that berseem had been attacked by plant-parasitic nematodes in the Imperial Valley, but like alfalfa, it carried nematodes in limited numbers. Baltensperger et al.  (1985) evaluated 9 germplasm sources, and found that all were severely galled by <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp. Duke (1981) listed 12 types of plant parasitic nematodes as being associated with berseem.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Adequate phosphorus helps ensure shade tolerance of berseem clover in agroforestry systems (Hazra and Tripathi, 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seed should be sown at a depth of 1.3-2.5 cm (about 0.5 to 1 in) (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Berseem clover can be grown in combination with white clover, oat, or rye (Duke, 1981).  Mixtures of 'Multicut' Berseem clover and annual ryegrass combine advantages of both plant species by providing early winter production as well as extending the availability of high quality forage through late spring (Graves et al., 1989).<P> 'Multicut' berseem and annual ryegrass were planted in mixtures in field trials at Davis.  Annual ryegrass alone yielded about half as much biomass as 'Multicut' alone.  The mixtures of 50% and 75% 'Multicut' with ryegrass yielded as much as 'Multicut' alone (13,800 lbs/acre dry matter). 'Multicut' became dominant in all mixtures by the third harvest.  The frost-tolerant cultivar 'Bigbee' can be included with 'Multicut' as an insurance against freezeout.  In trials at Davis it was noted that 'Bigbee', because of its shorter stature, appeared to contribute progressively less to the mixture after the first harvest (Graves et al., 1987).<P> Late maturation makes berseem clover tricky to use in relay-intercropping schemes with summer vegetables because of potential competition with the cash crops for light, nutrients, and water (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Kennedy and Mackie (1925) stated that when berseem is sown early on soft soil, ordinary weeds are controlled by its dense growth, but when grown on hard soils or when the stand is thin, weeds may continue.  Mallow (<I>Malva</I></B>) and Lamb's-quarter (<I>Chenopodium</I></B> sp.) have persisted in berseem fields in the Imperial Valley.  Sourclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B>) has become established in the Imperial Valley and is persistent in fields of berseem on heavy or hard soils.  Mixed seed of sourclover and berseem are almost impossible to separate.  Contaminated berseem fields should not be harvested for seed.  Dodder (<I>Cuscuta</I></B>) attacks berseem in Egypt but has not as yet appeared on berseem in California.  Mowing of berseem clover may be essential to control weeds (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Graves et al.  (1987) stated that berseem is a fairly strong competitor with winter weeds during establishment and by the third cutting is often weed-free. In fall-seeded 'Bigbee' berseem plots, weed above-ground biomass in mid-May was 0.167+/-0.104 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  (3.4% of the weed biomass in control plots) in Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass. In the same trial, per cent vegetational cover data for berseem during May was 98.75+/-1.25 (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Berseem clover is heavily fed upon by rabbits (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Berseem clover is considered native to the Mediterranean region, Near East, and India (Duke, 1981); Knight (1985) however, stated that the wild parent of berseem clover has apparently become extinct.  Berseem has been introduced to California and the southern U.S., especially Florida.  However, it does not volunteer in these areas.  Its tolerances range from the Boreal Wet through Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zones (Duke, 1981). Berseem clover can be grown as a summer annual in areas with cool, moist summers. It does best as a winter annual in areas with long, warm winters and no frost danger (Knight, 1985). Berseem clover grows in most of the U.S.  and does especially well along the Gulf coast and in the Yuma, Rio Grande, and Imperial valleys of the Southwest (McLeod, 1982).  It performed sporadically after its introduction to California (1896), Texas (1916), and Florida (1950) (Graves et al., 1989), and it should not be grown as a winter annual in areas where winter temperatures commonly go as low as 6 degrees C or lower (Knight, 1985).  Berseem clover does best below 65 m (2,500 ft) in elevation (Knight, 1985).  'Miskawi' is best adapted to regions of mild winter where irrigation is practiced (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Total N contribution of berseem can range from 50-400 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Cv 'Burton' (now 'Multicut') fixed 300 lb/acre/yr of atmospheric nitrogen in four years of field testing of 'Multicut' berseem germplasm under supplemental irrigation in the Central Valley (Morey and Marchant, 1977).  In a five-year study on an irrigated Yolo loam, Williams et al.  (1990) found that total annual nitrogen fixation ranged from 275 to 400 lb N/ac for 'Multicut' and from 150 to 350 lb N/ac for 'Bigbee.' With five or six cuttings, irrigated 'Bigbee' and 'Multicut' berseem clovers apparently fixed 272-400 kg/ha of N while obtaining 50-235 kg/ha from soil.  When over 150 kg/ha of soil nitrogen was available per year, nitrogen fixation declined steeply (Williams, 1990).  In trials at Cal Poly - Pomona, nitrogen fixed was consistently lower than that measured at Davis (Yolo County), and ranged from 158 to 214 lbs per acre.  This lower fixation was attributed to higher residual nitrogen in the soil (Graves et al., 1987).  In Georgia, berseem clover replaced up to 97 kg/ha of N in corn and sorghum production; mean above-ground N-content was 110 kg/ha (McVay, Radcliffe, and Hargrove, 1989). At plowdown, available N from berseem cover crops can be estimated by multiplying harvested fresh weight of cover crop from a sixteen square feet (4 x 4 ft.) sample plot by 13 (to estimate lbs of N/acre) (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Crude protein contents of berseem clover remained stable through successive mowings (28-30%, slightly higher than crimson clover or alfalfa) (Knight, 1985).  Graves and Munoz (1986) presented the following production schedule, obtainable with a September 15 seeding in San Diego County:<P>

</PRE><P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>All kinds of stock and poultry feed on berseem and prefer it to alfalfa.  In fields of alfalfa and berseem mixed, cattle and horses select the berseem, leaving most of the alfalfa until the berseem has been grazed to the ground. Replacing alfalfa with berseem showed an increase in butter fat per cow daily of more than 10%, and there are no problems with butter or milk having unusual flavor.  Bloating (tympanitis) from feeding berseem when covered with dew is very rare in Egypt and Australia and not serious when it does occur.  In the Imperial Valley, no bloating with berseem has occurred although it is reported for alfalfa (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  Berseem can be direct pastured, but some caution has to be observed to reduce the potential of bloat (Graves and Munoz, 1986).  Crude protein contents of berseem clover remained stable through successive mowings (28-30%, slightly higher than crimson clover or alfalfa) (Knight, 1985). Zahradnik (1985) asserts that 'Bigbee' is a palatable and nutritious legume and confirms that crude protein concentration is slightly higher than crimson clover or alfalfa and that berseem does not cause bloat.<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Berseem clover can be grown as a summer annual in areas with cool, moist summers.  Berseem clover does best as a winter annual in areas with long, warm winters and no frost danger (Knight, 1985).  Compared to other clovers, 'Bigbee' berseem grows more vigorously in the fall and spring (Zahradnik, 1985).  Flowering begins in May, and seed is ripe by late July.  When the crop reaches a height of 16 to 20 in, buds from 1 to 2 in long develop from nodes, and the crop is ready for biomass harvest (Graves et al., 1987).  Berseem clover flowers are self sterile and are pollinated by honeybees (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Berseem clover can be mowed several times for forage and then ploughed under as green manure (yielding 33-66 kg/ha of nitrogen), or it can be allowed to produce seed following the final cutting (Knight, 1985).  If the crop is to be used for green manure, the cuttings may be transferred directly and turned without composting (Graves and Munoz, 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Berseem is used for forage in the eastern Mediterranean region and subtropical areas.  It can be green-chopped, grazed, or used for silage and by all measures its quality is excellent (Duke, 1981; see also Munoz & Graves, 1988; McLeod, 1982).  As detailed by Graves and Munoz (1986), berseem affords other uses as well: green manure (see also McLeod, 1982), renovating old clover or alfalfa stands, and as a "break crop" in rotations, for disrupting weed and other pests' life cycles.  It can be mowed several times for forage and then ploughed under as green manure (yielding 33-66 kg/ha of nitrogen), or it can be allowed to produce seed following the final cutting (Knight, 1985). For greenchop, the cuttings may be loaded and taken directly to the livestock feeders.  The cuttings can be used for silage by mixing with grass cuttings, hay, or straw to produce the proper moisture content for silage fermentation (Graves and Munoz, 1986). Clippings can be used in compost preparation or as green manure on adjacent areas (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Berseem clover is an erect-growing, non-reseeding annual legume with oblong, slightly hairy leaflets lacking a watermark. It has hollow stems and a short taproot.  Flowers are yellowish white, self-sterile, and clustered in dense elliptical heads about 1 in long.  Each floret produces one roughly-spherical yellow seed (Graves et al., 1987).  Berseem clover flowers are self sterile and are pollinated by honeybees (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Cultivars of berseem clover that exhibit basal branching (e.g., 'Miscawi', 'Bigbee', 'Multicut') can regrow from repeated cuttings, and these produce more regrowth if mowed before bloom than if mowed after (Knight, 1985).  In fact, mowing of berseem clover during February may be essential to control weeds (Bugg, pers. comm.). Berseem can be mowed several times for forage and then ploughed under as green manure (yielding 33-66 kg/ha of nitrogen), or it can be allowed to produce seed following the final cutting (Knight, 1985). Crude protein contents of berseem clover remained stable through successive mowings (28-30%, slightly higher than crimson clover or alfalfa) (Knight, 1985). Berseem clover seed yields exceed 1,100 kg/ha in Arizona (Knight, 1985).  Most varieties of berseem clover do not normally reseed and reestablish well, but the Italian variety 'Sacromonte' has done so in Mississippi (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Cultivars of berseem clover that exhibit basal branching (e.g., 'Miscawi', 'Bigbee', 'Multicut') can regrow from repeated cuttings (Knight, 1985).  They are very responsive to mowing or grazing; will resprout quickly from the crown (Miller, 1989); and can be mowed frequently for weed control or for animal feed (Miller, 1988).  In fact, mowing may be essential to control weeds (Bugg, pers. comm.).  According to Munoz & Graves (1988), berseem should be mowed each time it reaches 16 inches; however, according to Miller et al (1989), it should be cut every time it regrows to 14 to 18 inches during the late winter and spring season (5 or 6 times).  With five or six cuttings, 'Bigbee' and 'Multicut' berseem clovers apparently fixed 272-400 kg/ha of N while obtaining 50-235 kg/ha from soil.  When over 150 kg/ha of soil nitrogen was available per year, nitrogen fixation declined steeply (Williams et al., 1990).  Berseem produces more regrowth if mowed before bloom than if mowed after (Knight, 1985), and crude protein contents remained stable through successive mowings (28-30%, slightly higher than crimson clover or alfalfa) (Knight, 1985). Berseem clover can be mowed several times for forage, and then ploughed under as green manure (yielding 33-66 kg/ha of nitrogen), or allowed to produce seed following the final cutting (Knight, 1985).  With 'Bigbee', grazing or cutting should begin when the stand is 10 inches high and basal shoots are visible (Zahradnik, 1985).  'Fahl' can be cut only once (Graves et al., 1989). According to Graves et al. (1989), 'Miscawi' can be cut 5 or 6 times; however, Kennedy and Macki (1925) suggest cutting it from 4 to 8 depending on the amount of water used and the height of the crop when cut.  'Saidi' can be cut two or 3 times (Graves et al., 1989).<P>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Berseem or Egyptian Clover (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925; McLeod, 1982)<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Berseem clover does not withstand extreme heat or cold and is the least winter hardy of the cultivated clovers (McLeod, 1982). It should not be grown in areas where winter temperatures commonly go as low as 6 degrees C or lower (Knight, 1985).  The most cold-hardy variety is cv 'Bigbee' (Graves et al., 1987), but 'Multicut' has withstood temperatures as low as 24 F without damage (Graves et al., 1987).  In general, berseem sown early in autumn resists frost much better than that which is late sown (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  Among the Egyptian landraces, 'Miskawi' does not do well with intense heat; late sowings result in reduced number of cuttings that may be made due to injury from summer weather; however, it appeared to be the most cold resistant (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Berseem tolerates soil pH ranging from 4.9-7.8 with a mean of 15 cases of 6.8 (Duke, 1981) and has been noted as tolerating basic to acidic soils (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  It has been mentioned as alkali tolerant (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925; McLeod, 1982) and is said to do best on slightly alkaline soils (Zahradnik, 1985; Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Berseem clover tolerates loam to clay soils (Munoz & Graves, 1988); it has been said to do best on medium loam soil (Knight, 1985; Zahradnik, 1985).  Experiments in the Imperial Valley with berseem indicate that tight, heavy soils are not well adapted to this crop, but the softer loamy and silty soils produce good crops. Loose river sand deposits yielded poorly.  In the Imperial Valley, those soils containing large quantities of very fine sand or silt produce the best crops of berseem.  The Imperial Valley soils which produce good crops of alfalfa are best adapted to berseem (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates (using drill) have been given as 10 lbs/acre (Zahradnik, 1985), 15-20 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982; Graves et al., 1987), 15 to 25 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989), 17-22 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and 20 lb/acre (Miller, 1988).  If seed is to be broadcast, a rate of 20 lbs/acre has been recommended (Zahradnik, 1985); pre-inoculated seed should be broadcast at 25 to 30 lbs/acre (Graves and Munoz, 1986).  On medium soil at the Imperial Valley Experiment Station, excellent stands resulted from drilling 12 lbs/acre.  On heavy or poorly-conditioned soils, as much as 20 lbs/acre may be required.  Excessive seeding rates produce excessively-thick stands which prevents tillering and spreading of the root crowns (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Berseem clover seed costs about $1.10/lb (Munoz & Graves, 1988); Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the price as $1.72 per lb retail in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Berseem clover is said to tolerate from 3.8 to 16.6 dm of precipitation (15-65 inches) (mean of 17 cases, 8.7 (34.25 inches). It is said to require from 25-30" of irrigation, from which should be deducted the amount of rainfall received (Munoz & Graves, 1988). McLeod (1982) states that berseem thrives under irrigation; Kennedy and Mackie (1925) stated that it requires almost the same quantity of water as alfalfa applied in the same manner and at the same intervals of time.  The irrigation schedule should follow that of fall-planted alfalfa according to Graves et al. (1987). Too-frequent irrigations were found to retard the development of roots and stems.  Softer soils (presumably soils with better tilth) require fewer irrigations (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  Berseem tolerates moderate periods of waterlogging in the soil (Graves et al., 1987).<P> An appropriate irrigation regime would include: (1) light, frequent irrigations to germinate seeds - two weeks; (2) after seedling stage - heavier weekly irrigations until the first late fall rains; (3) no irrigation is needed in the winter unless a dry period of more than three weeks occurs, or unless the soils are sandy; (4) spring irrigations to start as soon as soil drying begins and to continue until final cutting is made or seed formation is completed.  The above irrigation requirements for the San Diego coast and inland areas will require approximately the following schedule (Graves and Munoz, 1986):<P> 
<PRE>
 September               1 inch
 October                 1 inch
 November                2 inches
 December through March  rain
 April                   4 inches
 May                     4.5 inches
 June                    1.5 inches
 Total                   14.0 inches
</PRE>

 Berseem clover can tolerate more soil moisture than either alfalfa or white sweetclover and is similar to alfalfa in drought tolerance (Knight, 1985).  'Bigbee' is similar in drought tolerance to alfalfa but can withstand a little more soil moisture than alfalfa (Zahradnik, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Rhizobium type "R" (Nitragin Co.) is the recommended inoculant for berseem (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Munoz & Graves, 1988) which is the same type used for crimson clover (Zahradnik, 1985). However, superior strains of <I>Rhizobium</I></B> were found in Tunisia by Burton during 1981 (Graves et al., 1989).  As a result, Duke (1981) suggests that Special Culture "No. 1" for <I>Trifolium</I></B> should be used.  Seed should be pellet-inoculated before planting. (Graves et al., 1987).  Inoculation of bur clover and berseem clover seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD accelerated the development of nodules.  There was also an increase in root surface area and nutrient uptake according to Yahalom et al. (1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Kennedy and Mackie (1925) mentioned that many (unspecified) pest insects can build up on berseem clover with potential adverse effects to other crops should these pests disperse.  To prevent excessive build up, irrigation of berseem in Egypt is stopped by law by the end of April.  Weevils which attack berseem severely in Egypt have not yet appeared in the Imperial Valley.  The Chalcis fly, found attacking alfalfa seed in this region, has not attacked berseem.  In southern Georgia, Bugg et al. (1990) found relatively few aphids or lady beetles associated with berseem, but extremely high densities of a bigeyed bug, <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B>, an important beneficial generalist predator, during late May and early June.  Flowers of berseem attract bees (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seed is small (Miller, 1988).  Kennedy and Mackie (1925) state that the seed is slightly smaller than that of red clover and about the same size and shape as that of crimson clover, egg-shaped, reddish brown, and about one-twelfth of an inch long (2 mm.).  On the average there are about 200,000 seeds per pound (Graves et al. 1987), or about 440 seeds/gram (Graves et al., 1989).  Most seeds are yellow; about 10 to 15% of the seeds are purple.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Berseem should be seeded during early fall (Graves et al., 1987;Munoz & Graves, 1988; Miller et al., 1989).  This has been translated as early October for much of California (Miller, 1988). In the Imperial Valley, late September or early October are preferable times of seeding.  When a crop of seed only is desired, spring seeding in February may be practiced (Kennedy and Mackie, 1925).  In San Diego County, seeding Dates are: September 1-15, inland areas to 1,500 feet elevation and September 15-30 for the coastal areas of San Diego County (Graves and Munoz, 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Seeded areas should be sprinkle irrigated, if necessary, to establish a vigorous stand before cold weather begins (Miller, 1988).<P>

<P>
Revelations about the fumigant methyl bromide's strong link to
ozone depletion remind us once again that everything is connected
to everything.  Methyl bromide is used for both structural and
agricultural pest control.  It is an effective fumigant but it
has also been linked to health problems and the depletion of the
ozone layer.<BR>
<P>
Methyl bromide is a classic example of the way we declare war
on nature in our quest to produce food.  Previously I have discussed
how we tend to want to dominate and control nature.  I believe
the systems approach, looking at the whole picture rather than
at a specific issue, can help provide a strategy for dealing with
the problems that have prompted us to use methyl bromide. <B>Will
Allen</B>, director of the California Institute for Rural Studies
rural toxics project and a farmer representative to a recent United
Nations Education Program/EPA international workshop on methyl
bromide, reminds us that farmers will not enhance their image
with the general public when it becomes known that methyl bromide
is an extremely efficient ozone depleter, 30 to 120 times more
effective than the notorious chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  Unfortunately,
the United Nations guidelines for methyl bromide replacements
include chloropicrin, Telone-2 and metam-sodium, all of which
are in regulatory trouble in California.<BR>
<P>
Solutions to the dilemma of using methyl bromide in agriculture
may lie in the adoption of new and existing cultural practices
instead of looking for more acceptable chemicals.  Good soil organic
matter management, crop rotation strategies, cover crops, and
experiments with new crop varieties may eliminate the need for
soil fumigants.  Providing habitat for beneficial organisms is
one way to naturally solve crop pest problems.  This perspective
of the soil assumes that it is an ally rather than a home for
pests that must be obliterated with a fumigant.  There is much
we don't know about soil biology; we have only begun to understand
the roles and interactions of various microorganisms.  When we
work with nature it has a tendency to work with us-which is what
we all want in the end<I>. -<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, director, UC Sustainable

<H1>Sources of Funding</H1>

<H3><B>Organic Research Grants</B></H3>

<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation is offering funds for
organic farming methods research, dissemination of research results
to organic farmers and to growers interested in making the transition
to organic production systems, and public education on organic
farming issues. Projects should involve farmers in both design
and execution, and take place on working farms whenever possible.
Proposals of $3,000-$5,000 are encouraged. Most projects will
be less than $10,000. Matching funds from other sources and/or
in-kind contributions from cooperators are encouraged but not
required. Proposals are considered twice a year. Proposals received
by July 15,1993 will be awarded by October 30, 1993. To receive
copies of grant application procedures and the &quot;OFRF Research
and Education Priorities&quot; which describes target areas, write

<H3><B>Charles A. Lindbergh Fund</B></H3>

<P>
Each year the Charles A. Lindbergh Fund, Inc. provides grants
of up to $10,580 (a symbolic amount representing the cost of &quot;The
Spirit of St. Louis&quot;) to individuals whose work furthers
the balance between the environment and technological progress.
Categories of the award include aviation/ aerospace, agriculture,
arts and humanities, biomedical research, conservation of natural
resources, exploration, health and population sciences, intercultural
communication, oceanography, waste disposal management, water
resource management, and wildlife preservation. Grants are directed
at individuals rather than institutional programs. All application
materials must be postmarked by June 15, 1993. For applications
and more information contact Marlene K. White, The Charles A.
Lindbergh Fund, Inc., 708 South 3rd Street, Suite 110, Minneapolis,

<P>
University Research Expeditions Program (UREP) provides funds
and field assistance to University of California researchers worldwide.
Applicants need not qualify for principal investigator (PI) status.
Support is provided by selected members of the public who subsidize
research costs through tax-deductible donations and contribute
their own skills and time as short-term field assistants. UREP
funds can be used for short or long-term field research, as seed
money for new research, to extend continuing projects, supplement
other grants and support graduate students or additional staff.
Proposal deadlines: April 9, 1993 (for projects during November
1993-May 1994); October 1, 1993 (for projects during June 1994-Oct.
1994). For more information, contact University Research Expeditions
Program, Desk D06, University of California, Berkeley, Ca 94720,

<H3><B>Stewardship Incentive Program</B></H3>

<P>
Federal Stewardship Incentive Program (SIP) funding of up to $10,000
per landowner per year is available to private individuals, groups,
associations, corporations, Indian tribes or other legal private
entities who own rural lands with existing tree cover or woody
vegetation or land suitable for growing such vegetation. The Food,
Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 authorizes the
SIP to offer cost-sharing assistance to improve management of
nonindustrial private forest lands. Landowners must maintain and
protect SIP funded practices for a minimum of ten years. Eligible
landowners must have an approved Forest Stewardship Plan and own
up to 1,000 acres of qualifying land. (Authorizations must be
obtained for exceptions of up to 5,000 acres.) Existing management
plans can be modified to meet guidelines. Specific SIP practices
approved for cost-share assistance include management plan development,
reforestation, forest and agroforest improvement, windbreak and
hedgerow establishment and maintenance, soil and water protection
and improvement, riparian and wetland protection and improvement,
fisheries habitat enhancement, wildlife habitat enhancement, and
forest recreation enhancement. For more information contact a
state forester, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
office, County Extension office, or Soil Conservation office.

</H1>
<P>
We hear much about biotechnology-about its &quot;bright side&quot;
and its &quot;dark side.&quot;  Recently a full gamut of opinions
about biotechnology was heard at a Sacramento meeting sponsored
by the National Agricultural Biotechnology Council.  Sentiments
ranged from discussions of when biotechnology will deliver its
promised results, to questions about whether the results would
be what we want or expect.  The intensity that such discussions
can generate sometimes makes it hard to remember that biotechnology,
like irrigation management, is a tool rather than a philosophy.
<BR>
<P>
As an individual working in sustainable agriculture I hope that
what biotechnology delivers will serve us all.  In my opinion,
biotechnology must be used within the general guidelines of the
definition of sustainable agriculture, i.e., its end results (products
or processes) must be economically viable, environmentally sound
and socially just.<BR>
<P>
Much of the emphasis in biotechnology seems to be on product development,
often with little understanding of how products will function
in agricultural systems.  Many questions have been raised about
biotechnology:  Is it acceptable for companies to develop herbicide-tolerant
crops for use with herbicides that create health or environmental
problems?  Will companies develop products so they can dominate
the market and ultimately the structure of agriculture?  Is it
wise to introduce organisms into the environment that are totally
new and different?  Will biotechnology threaten the genetic diversity
of our plant and animal production systems and therefore the stability
of the food supply?  Is it wise to have so few scientists or companies
making decisions for so many?  Should universities invest substantial
resources in biotechnology?  If they do, will the research be
for the general public rather than for a few private companies
or individuals?  Should universities invest substantial resources
in product development for private companies?<BR>
<P>
I believe we need a dose of healthy skepticism as we examine biotechnology,
but we also need to be open minded so that dialogue can continue.
 Those of us in sustainable agriculture continue to discuss and
struggle with the concept of sustainability.  I believe efforts
to do the same with biotechnology will be helpful.  As we become
more sophisticated about technology and humans' role in the scheme
of things, these questions are a natural outgrowth of our desire
to discover where we should be going as a society.  The Sacramento
agricultural biotechnology meeting helped by providing a forum
for such dialogue to continue. <I>-Bill</I> <I>Liebhardt, director

California Department of Conservation, Office of Land Conservation.
 1991<BR>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note: This 97-page study was commissioned by the
Office of Land Conservation of the California Department of Conservation
in response to the lack of available information on the socioeconomic
and environmental impacts of farmland conversion. Prepared by
Jones &amp; Stokes Associates, Inc., an independent, Sacramento-based
consulting firm, the report makes significant progress in identifying
the rate and extent of farmland conversion in critical agricultural
regions, and documenting the resulting impacts. While not a definitive
study, the report is sure to serve as an invaluable springboard
for future research. It may also prompt reforms that strengthen
the way state officials assess the environmental impacts of farmland
conversions.<BR>
</I>
<H3>Methodology</H3>
<P>
The report is based on published data and interviews with more
than 70 individuals directly concerned with farmland conversion
and related issues.  The interviewees represented a range of interests
and backgrounds, and included officials from county agricultural
offices, planning departments, and UC Cooperative Extension; also
interviewed were environmental officials, farmers, farm labor
contractors, and soil conservationists.<BR>
<P>
The heart of the document consists of two case studies of farmland
conversion, one in Ventura County, and the other in the Northern
San Joaquin Valley (San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties). In each
case two types of conversion are considered: cropland to urban
uses (&quot;Type A&quot; conversions) and wildlands to croplands
(&quot;Type B&quot; conversions). The study examined conversion
patterns over the past two decades, with a focus on those that
took place between 1984 and 1988.<BR>
<P>
A special concern of the study was to evaluate the adequacy of
the impact analysis of farmland conversions that has taken place
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and to
recommend amendments to improve the environmental impact reports
(EIRs) for proposed conversions covered by the Act. A total of
26 past EIR's that involved farmland conversions of over 100 acres
near urban areas were reviewed to determine their rigor and comprehensiveness.
<BR>
<H3>Results</H3>
<P>
<B>Acreage loss.</B> Not surprisingly, the study finds that prime
farmland is being lost to urban expansion near existing cities.
In the northern San Joaquin Valley, alfalfa and field crops lost
the most acreage Table 1), while in Ventura County, vegetables,
citrus and field crops experienced the heaviest losses (Table
2). In both Stanislaus and Ventura Counties, Type B conversions
of wildlands to croplands were roughly equal in area to Type A
conversions.  Type A conversions were dominated by new avocado
orchards on hilly terrain (Ventura County) and almond orchards
(San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties). In San Joaquin County,
little new cropland has been established since 1976.<BR>
<P>
The report echoes the alarm heard elsewhere about the diminishing
supply of prime farmland: &quot;If Type A conversion trends occurring
between 1974 and 1986 continued through the year 2010, farmland
losses in the Central Valley would exceed 300,000 acres, or over
4 percent of the state's stock of important farmlands. Projected
over one century, urbanization in the Central Valley alone would
claim one-fourth of the state's important farmlands.&quot;

<B>Impacts.</B> The impacts of urban encroachment are examined
from the perspective of both urban residents and farmers. For
urban residents in these newly developed areas, nuisances and
health risks such as pesticide exposure, dust, noise and odor
are the most common complaints.  For farmers, urban encroachment
adversely affects the efficiency of remaining farming operations
due to &quot;increased air pollution, livestock predation by pets,
crop diseases resulting from inadequate care off-farm ornamental
plants, restrictions on pesticide use and burning, and requirements
to set aside on-farm buffer zones.&quot; At the same time, production
costs increase due to rising land values, water scarcity, theft
and vandalism of farm equipment, crop pilferage, road congestion,
and personal injury liability resulting from trespassing on farms.
By reducing the profitability of remaining farming operations,
urban encroachment tends to take on a spiraling effect, encouraging
further losses of farms to urban development.<BR>
<P>
In terms of socioeconomic impacts, the report finds conversions
to have little effect on the viability of the regional agricultural
sectors. The most critical impact is on housing prices, which
have risen as growth occurs. The report concludes that &quot;farmland
conversion appears to be correlated with worsening housing conditions
for farm workers and other low-income segments of the population.&quot;
Currently, most California farm workers who do not live in government-operated
labor camps live in substandard housing.<BR>
<P>
Both Type A and Type B conversions are associated with negative
environmental impacts such as the loss of wildlife habitat.  Type
B conversions can increase groundwater scarcity and sometimes
increase groundwater contamination, while Type A conversions are
expected to have a beneficial impact on water quality due to reduced
pesticide use and replacement of septic systems with municipal
wastewater treatment facilities. Increased air pollution due to
vehicle emissions (due to Type A conversion) and atmospheric dust
(due to Type B conversion) are also found. In fact, &quot;acid
fog&quot; is now becoming a recognized problem in the San Joaquin
Valley and ozone pollution is responsible for significant reductions
in yield. For example, one study cited in the report found a 34
percent reduction in grape yield due to ozone pollution.<BR>
<P>
The report finds existing CEQA EIR's inadequate, because they
have tended to focus too narrowly on loss of prime soils without
considering the related issues. It recommends a broader focus
along the lines used in this study and improved guidelines to
assist lead agencies and EIR preparers.<BR>
<H3>Reviewer Comments</H3>
<P>
The report paints a predominantly negative picture of how farmland
conversion impacts the sustainability of California agriculture.
Aside from the environmental impacts, the most important issue
related to sustainability identified in this report is the influence
of rising land values.  Escalating values create barriers to entering
farmers, and pressure existing farmers to change to high-value
crops to make mortgage or rental payments. High land values also
encourage farmers to view their holdings in light of their short-term
development potential, as opposed to making long-term investments
that improve the holding's agricultural value. In general, these
pressures discourage farmers from adopting sustainable practices
and a long-term perspective on the value of their land.<BR>
<P>
On the other hand, the increased proximity of urban residents
to farms is creating pressure to curb pesticide usage, burning,
etc. This pressure provides a tangible incentive for farmers to
consider a range of alternative practices.  A key issue that will
determine whether agriculture can be preserved on prime soils
is whether the transition to these practices can be made economically.
Policymakers can help by increasing support for research on sustainable
practices and providing economic aid to help farmers during the
transition. More broadly, the Office of Land Conservation report
emphasizes the need for growth management policies that protect
prime farmland from urban encroachment. Finally, the report underscores
once again the need for policies that address the glaring need
for adequate low-income housing for California's farm workers.

The three-year-old Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN), a cooperative
effort by people from universities, government, business and nonprofit
organizations from throughout the U.S., has made steady progress
toward its goal of improving access to existing and new information
on sustainable agriculture systems, techniques, and issues. The
interrelated publications and databases are available and being
used by farmers, Extension agents, activists and others around
the world. <BR>

<P>
SAN has four publications that are available in print and computerized
forms:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>  The 1993 <I>Sustainable Agriculture Directory of Expertise</I>,
which lists over 700 people and organizations willing to share
their information and experience in soil-building, pest management,
marketing, and many other areas; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  The <I>Showcase of Sustainable Agriculture Information and
Educational Materials</I>, a compilation of over 300 publications,
videos, and other materials, including detailed descriptions and
order information; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  The first in a series of practical handbooks for farmers,
<I>Managing Cover Crops</I> Profitably (a second handbook, due
out in 1994, addresses tillage tools and techniques); 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>  The 1993 compendium of research and education projects funded
by the national Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
and Agriculture in Concert with the Environment (SARE/ACE) programs,
including the new farmer-initiated grants of the North Central
and Northeast regions, and updated information on all projects.

</UL>

<P>

<P>
Each of these publications demonstrates the SAN philosophy of
organizing practical information from a variety of sources-private
and public organizations as well as farmers themselves-into useful
forms for farmers and the general public. Each draws upon a wide
range of sources of information, both experimental and &quot;experiential,&quot;
that is, based on the practical experiences of farmers and others.
<BR>

<H3>How to Get SAN Products<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Nearly everything that SAN produces is available in three forms:
in print, on diskette, and via the Internet system of computer
networks. That way, people who use computers can have the advantage
of searching, retrieving and manipulating information from the
SAN databases, but people who don't use computers are not left
out. <BR>

<P>
Print publications are available from Sustainable Agriculture
Publications, Hills Building, Room 12, University of Vermont,
Burlington, VT 05405. Prices include postage and handling: $14.95
for the Directory, $4.95 for the Showcase, and $9.95 for the Handbook.
The SARE/ACE project compendia are available separately through
the four regional offices of the SARE program: West, <B>Kristen
Kelleher</B>, USDA Sustainable Agriculture Program, University
of California, Davis, CA 95616; North Central, <B>Lisa Jasa,</B>
207 Agriculture Hall, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0704;
South, <B>Gwen Roland,</B> c/o SARE/ACE Program, Georgia Experiment
station, Griffen, GA 30223-1797; Northeast, <B>Beth Holtzman</B>,
Plant &amp; Soil Science Dept., University of Vermont, Burlington,
VT 05405.<BR>

<P>
SAN information on diskette is available in Folio &quot;Infobases&quot;
prepared by <B>Phil Rasmussen</B> at Utah state University. (Rasmussen
is the new head of the Western Region USDA SARE program, see p.9.)
Infobases allow you to read electronic &quot;books&quot; by browsing
through them, jumping from section to section via hypertext links,
or searching for key words anywhere in the document. Once you've
found the information you need, you can print it or save it to
a file, which you can then capture into your word processor or
e-mail to a colleague across the country. Each of the publications
described above fits on one high-density 3 1/2 inch floppy disk;
also available is the complete text of the 1990 Farm Bill on an
Infobase, which fits on two high density 3 1/2 inch disks. These
Infobases are currently for DOS users only, but Windows and Macintosh
versions are forthcoming. Each disk includes the Infobase plus
the software needed to read it. To receive the DOS Infobases,
send two blank, formatted, high-density 3 1/2 inch disks for EACH
database you want to Phil Rasmussen, Ag Systems &amp; Technology
Dept., Utah state University, UMC-2300, Logan, Utah, 84322-2300.
Please include a self-addressed label, and return AIRMAIL postage
if you're outside the U.S. (or your order will travel by surface
mail). Or, if you're an experienced Internet user, you can get
them via ftp (file transfer protocol) from extsparc.agsci.usu.edu
(129.123.13.55; Be sure to use binary transfer.) <BR>

<P>
SAN databases are posted on the Internet at North Carolina State
University by <B>Kevin Gamble</B>. They can be searched and retrieved
by electronic mail commands, or more interactively via the Internet
search tools &quot;gopher, &quot; &quot;WAIS&quot; and &quot;WWW.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Many people associate the Internet with universities and government,
but it's accessible to everyone through a variety of commercial
and nonprofit computer conferencing systems such as Econet, Handsnet,
Compuserve, MCI-Mail, Delphi and America On-Line. (An informative
article comparing these and other systems appeared in USA Today,
October 7, 1993, p. 4-D.) <BR>

<P>
SAN also sponsors an electronic mail discussion group for users
of the Internet. Participants (about 600 of them at this writing)
post notices of new sources of information, and request help finding
information. Imagine being able to ask 600 experts for help, with
the time and effort that it usually takes to contact one or two
by phone or fax! A calendar of sustainable agriculture events
is also at your fingertips via the Internet. <BR>

<P>
For instructions on searching the SAN databases, joining the e-mail
discussion group, or retrieving the SAN calendar, contact <B>Gabriel
Hegyes</B> (Internet: ghegyes@nalusda.gov) for a copy of &quot;Getting
Started Electronically with the Sustainable Agriculture Network.&quot;
<BR>

<H3>New Leadership<BR>
</H3>

<P>
SAN was planned and started by a national committee of diverse
individuals with funding from the SARE/ACE program. As its founding
chairperson, I'm very pleased to announce that <B>Jim Lukens</B>,
head of the ATTRA national information service, succeeded me as
chairperson in October 1993 for a three year term. I'm looking
forward to continuing involvement with SAN as a member of its
executive committee. SAN continues to be staffed very ably by
<B>Gabriel Hegyes</B>, who can be reached at SANlink, c/o AFSIC,
Room 304, National Agricultural Library, 10301 Baltimore Blvd.,
Beltsville, MD 207052351, (301) 504-6425. <BR>

<P>
After three years of spending a good share of my time launching
SAN, I'm particularly looking forward to reaping its benefits
closer to home by sharing information about the value of SAN and
how to use it with my research and extension colleagues here at
UC, and with individuals and organizations throughout the state.
We're working to deliver UC SAREP databases after the SAN model,
in Folio Infobases and via the Internet, as well as printed publications.
I would very much like to hear from Californians who are interested
in electronic access to SAN and SAREP.<BR>

<H1>Free Hypercard Stack on BGH Available Through Internet<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Hyperspace, Hypercards, information stacks: Park yourself in front
of your computer and ride the Internet to find out the latest
about bGH or bST, the synthetic bovine growth hormone recently
approved by the FDA for injection into dairy cows to increase
milk production. An educational infostack for Macintosh computers,
&quot;The Dairy Debate,&quot; has been developed by <B>Robert
Zomer</B> of the UC SAREP in conjunction with SAREP director<B>
Bill Liebhardt's</B> book <I>THE DAIRY</I> <I>DEBATE</I>: <I>Consequences
of Bovine Growth Hormone and Rotational Grazing Technologies</I>.
&quot;The Dairy Debate&quot; is an interactive computer program
for exploring the questions posed by genetically engineered bGH
or bST: How will the product affect humans, cows, and dairy farmers?
Are the genetically engineered formulations of the hormone identical
to naturally occurring bGH? How much extra milk already exists
in the U.S.? How much more milk is the use of bGH expected to
add to the surplus taxpayers pay to stockpile? &quot;'The Dairy
Debate' gives a preview of the kinds of information computer users
will be able to access about current events,&quot; Zomer says.
He designed a grazing cow to traipse through the information stack,
while a juggler weighs the probabilities within the carbon ring
of the different formulations of the hormone. See them move! Be
a player! The Hypercard application is available free through
the Internet system of computer networks by sending an e-mail
request to: rjzomer@ucdavis.edu. Or send a blank, high-density
3 1/2&quot; diskette and a return label, or $5 (checks to UC Regents)
to: Dairy Diskette, SAREP,  University of California, Davis, Ca
95616.<BR>

<H1>New PAC/TAC Members Join SAREP<BR>
</H1>
<P>
UC SAREP is required by the California Legislature's 1986 Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Act to have both public and
technical advisory committees to advise the university on program<B>
</B>goals and make recommendations on the award of competitive
grants.  The Public Advisory Committee (PAC) includes individuals
actively involved in agricultural production, as well as representatives
from government, public organizations, and institutions of higher
education.  The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is made up
of university wide faculty and staff with knowledge and experience
related to sustainable agriculture and makes recommendations about
the scientific merit of grant applications.  Each PAC or TAC member
serves for three years.  New members in 1992 are listed below.

<H1>Agricultural Animals and California's Water</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, SAREP</I>
<P>
<I>[Editor's Note: This is the first part of a two-part article
on the Oct. 20, 1994 conference &quot;Animal Agriculture Impacts
on Water Quality in California, which reported the results of
a year-long study or the same name undertaken by the UC Davis
Animal Agriculture Research Center and the UC Agricultural Issues
Center (AIC).  Proceedings Mil be available from AIC in January
1995.]</I>
<P>
How does livestock affect California's water? The state's animal
industry is large dairy, beef, poultry, sheep and hog operations
brought in more than $5.25 billion in 1993, at least one-quarter
of California's agriculture marketing receipts.  State and federal
agencies regulate the industry to protect water supplies, and
yet there is a lack of research based, site-specific information
on animals and water.  These issues prompted the UC Davis Animal
Agriculture Research Center and the UC Agricultural Issues Center
to jointly sponsor a year-long research study on the relationship
between animals and the state's water.  More than 60 UC scientists
from 16 departments and 14 Cooperative Extension offices, farmers
and environmental groups as well as representatives from ten state
and federal agencies contributed to the study, results of which
were presented at the &quot;Animal Agriculture Impacts on Water
Quality in California&quot; conference in Sacramento.  
<P>
Keynote speaker <B>Paul Johnson</B>, chief of the USDA's Natural
Resource Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation
Service), noted that because 75 percent of the land in the U.S.
is private, water conservation must begin with those who live
there.  He said partnerships and coordinated research with state
and federal agencies, the University of California, Cooperative
Extension and the farm press will be necessary to protect water.
 A former farmer and a member of the Iowa House of Representatives,
Johnson was instrumental in the passage of the Iowa Groundwater
Protection Act of 1987, which emphasizes research, education and
voluntary approaches to water quality.  
<P>
<B>Barbara Schneeman</B>, dean of UCD's College of Agriculture
and Environmental Sciences, noted that California's productive
animal agriculture industry understandably generates a large quantity
of by-products.  &quot;These aren't necessarily always negative,
but they need to be dealt with,&quot; she said, referring to the
500 million tons of manure produced daily by the state's more
than 300 million animals.
<H3>Where the Gaps Are</H3>

<P>
Schneeman said that researchers for the animal/water study were
&quot;charged to determine what information exists, how reliable
it is, and identify where gaps in the information exist.&quot;
She noted that livestock operations are larger and more concentrated
here than in other states, there is less rain, more feed is imported
and urban pressures are intense.  Limited water has produced concern
over its quality and quantity, &quot;particularly in the midst
of our eight-year drought,&quot;  Schneeman said.
<P>
She pointed out that dramatic animal management changes have taken
place in the state in the last 45 years.  She said that the number
and character of the state's dairy operations alone is very different,
shifting from 20,000 small dairy operations in 1950 to only 2,400
in 1991, each averaging more than 500 head, with many much larger.
<P>
As she introduced the first of four research teams that worked
on specific animal agriculture issues, she reiterated that accurate
information was the primary goal of the study.  &quot;Everyone
needs to be aware of what is really happening out there, and we
need to tell others,&quot; she said.
<P>
Each team leader's report was followed by a panel response that
included farmers and ranchers, water scientists, regulatory agency
officials, and audience participation.
<P>
The first research team report was presented by <B>James Oltjen</B>,
an animal management systems specialist in the UCD animal science
department, who discussed potential sources of water contamination
from grazing and confined animal operations.  He noted that in
California's varied climate zones and topography, site-specific
factors are key.  Potential pollutants of most concern are animal
manure, production water, storm water runoff, dead animals, dust,
silage, bedding, waste products, medicine, chemicals, sediment
and soil disturbance.  He said detailed information is needed
to better understand animal agriculture's contribution to water
pollution, and to look at the way manure can be a positive resource
as it is recycled for fertilizer, energy production and feed.
<H3>Cattle, Poultry, Hogs and Fish</H3>

<P>
Oltjen said feedlots in California maintain 375,000 head of beef
cattle.  Each 1000 lb. animal produces approximately 58 pounds
of total manure each day (8.5 lbs/solids).  The approximately
1.22 million dairy cows in the state (average size 1300 lbs) each
produce approximately 1.22 pounds of total manure daily (approximately
15/lb. solids).  In the poultry industry, 233 million broilers
produce 2.25 pounds each of dry manure during their short lifetimes,
which totals 5 30 million pounds of manure dry matter per year
The 26 million egg layers produce approximately 636 million pounds
per year of manure dry matter, while the 23.6 million California
turkeys produce 298 million pounds of manure dry matter annually.
<P>
Oltien also gave statistics for hogs and fish produced in the
state.  California hog growers raise 275,000 swine each year,
less than one percent of the nation's pork. (The state's consumers
eat more than 10 percent of all U.S. pork.) One thousand pounds
of live-weight pig (several animals) produces 84 pounds of manure
per day (11 lbs solids). (Not mentioned at the conference, but
noted in the study, is information about horse manure.  An average
horse weighing one thousand pounds is expected to produce 5 1
pounds of manure per day, including 1 5 pounds of total solids.
 There are about one million horses in California.)
<P>
Aquaculture, an agriculture industry that contributes about $30
million per year to the state, has highly regulated discharge
water &quot;Low concentration of waste in aquaculture water makes
it ideal for other applications such as agricultural irrigation,&quot;
Oltjen said.
<H3>Farmer Response</H3>

<P>
Responders included dairy farmer <B>Richard Michel</B>, who discussed
the importance of manure-handling use plans for producers that
extend from one to five years.
<P>
&quot;No one is more concerned about water quality than the dairy
farmer,&quot; Michel said.  &quot;He or she drinks the water,
the employees drink the water, the animals drink the water Poor
quality water means poor crops, sick animals, and soon to-be-out-of-business.
 &quot;
<P>
Michel said producers know it isn't possible to pile manure up
forever in one place and not expect a consequence.  He said, however,
that dairy farmers generally see manure not as a potential problem,
but as an asset.  &quot;We seem to be moving toward sustainable
and organic farming practices,&quot; he said.  &quot;This manure
is a great asset.  We use it (on our own fields) to help offset
the cost and use of commercial fertilizer.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Let's keep in mind the <U>potential</U> contamination of
water from animal operations,&quot; Michel said.  &quot;We have
to acknowledge that the possible contamination also comes from
other sources.&quot; He noted that when water is tested, it is
not possible to determine which nitrates or metals come from animals,
and which come from vineyards or orchards and commercial fertilizers.
<P>
Michel said further studies of potential contamination problems
&quot;could be justified by the university working with dairy
associations in specific areas of the state to make long-term
analysis.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We want long-term studies,&quot; he said.  &quot;The university
can work with Extension service people and farm advisors, who
already have a relationship with farmers.  University researchers
can provide information gathering and testing.  Above all, let's
avoid an additional bureaucracy that would entail extensive and
frequent reports and new fees from the farmer.&quot;
<P>
<B>Lonnie Wass, </B>a senior water resources control engineer
in the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board in
Fresno noted that he has seen permit requests for large dairy
operations increase, including one now under consideration for
a three-phased dairy farm of more than 10,000 cows.  &quot;That's
the size of a city in terms of waste production,&quot; he said.
 &quot;We need to be careful in evaluating the permits to make
sure we're not impairing the beneficial uses of surface or ground
water in the region.&quot;
<P>
<B>Sherman Swanson, </B>a riparian scientist at the University
of Nevada, Reno said that understanding cattle grazing behavior
can help researchers figure out what to do to maintain stream
environments.
<H3>Human Health Impacts</H3>

<P>
<B>Kenneth Tanji, </B>UCD professor of hydrologic science in the
land, air and water resources department, reported on his team's
research on the impacts on human health and agriculture and natural
systems.  He said that nitrate maps of California water wells
only show deeper wells, and do not include the many shallow, private
wells throughout the state.  Tanji stressed that the impacts of
animal wastes may be felt on-site as well as off-site; there is
not enough research now to know exactly where animal wastes go.
 He said nitrogen from manure and urine can be converted to nitrate,
the most mobile nitrogen form.  Water and land management practices
contribute to the possibility of nitrates migrating.  He said
it may take &quot;decades of travel time&quot; for the nitrate
to migrate to aquifers.  The Chino Basin area of Southern California,
which started increasing its animal population in the 1930s, began
showing signs of high nitrates in well water in the 1960s, he
said.  The area has frequently been used as an example of concentrated
animal waste and groundwater contamination.  Tanji noted the need
for increased environmental monitoring and the use of models to
improve waste management practices.  &quot;We need to better define
the problem to evaluate the effectiveness of management alternatives,&quot;
he said.
<P>
<B>Ralph Jurgens, </B>of New Era Farm Services, responded to Tanji's
report and talked about how he uses manure to produce composted
fertilizer.  He said there are 600 dairies within 20 miles of
his Tulare County office.  He stressed the systems approach to
composting what comes out of dairy farms, and using the products
on other farms.  &quot;Manure, if handled properly, is not a waste
product and does have a value,&quot; Jurgens said.  &quot;We compost
this material and sell it as a composted soil amendment and as
a fertilizer.&quot; Jurgens' operation serves more than 500 growers
throughout the state, representing 490,000 acres.
<P>
<B>Bruce Macler, </B>regional toxicologist for the U.S. EPA office
in San Francisco, said his work has showed him the truth in the
sayings &quot;everything is connected to everything; everything
has to go somewhere; and there is no such thing as a free lunch.&quot;
He pointed out that sedimentation released into streams by grazing
animals is like sandpaper, and takes the stream bed with it. 
Animal wastes released into streams encourage the growth of algae,
and toxic ammonia becomes part of the water stream.  Growing alfalfa
for animal feed brings the problems of subsidized water use and
pesticides into the picture.  He noted that human health concerns
include contaminated wells, the problems of recreational exposure
by people using rivers and lakes, and airborne dust contaminated
with pathogens.  He pointed out that pollution by microbials like
giardia contribute to human health problems.  &quot;The identified
outbreaks that occur from waterborne disease in the U.S. are small
relative to the estimated 3 to 5 million endemic waterborne illnesses
that occur each year,&quot; he said.  In terms of animal wastes,
Macler said that EPA is concerned with bacteria and protozoa contaminating
streams and groundwater.
<P>
<B>Brett Matzke, </B>the Sierra Nevada manager of California Trout,
Inc. presented one environmental organization's view of the water
problems related to animals.  He noted that 39 subspecies of salmon
and 40 species of other fish &quot;are in trouble.&quot; Sport
fishing brings in $1.7 billion to California coffers each year,
Matzke said, not including fishing license fees which contribute
an additional $40 million per year.  He expressed concern about
the 39 million acres of California land that is grazed, calling
grazing the &quot;number one culprit in damaging trout species.
 &quot; He agreed that partnerships are &quot;an excellent way
to get rid of stereotypes' among the groups affected by regulation.

<P>
Intensive vegetable production systems, with high inputs of both
water and nitrogen fertilizer, have been identified as a major
source of nitrate pollution in California. This paper, presented
at the 1992 California Plant and Soil Conference, describes a
simulation model whereby best management practices (practices
that minimize non-point source pollution, while remaining economically
viable for the farmer) can be determined for a given set of climatic
conditions and agronomic variables.  
<H3>Methods </H3>

<P>
Lettuce was chosen as the case study crop. Specific objectives
were to &quot;demonstrate how physical-chemical-biological modeling
approaches can assess environmental and economic consequences
of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water management.&quot;
The USDA Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) was the
model chosen for this study because it uses easily-obtained input
data, and is able to account for irrigation and fertilization
practices. <BR>

<P>
EPIC first had to be calibrated to real field circumstances. This
was accomplished using 1990 data for spring- and summer-planted
lettuce grown on a 11-hectare field in the Saloons Valley, California.
After calibration, the model was applied to hypothetical simulations
of different rates of applied irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer.
<BR>

<P>
The conditions for the case study simulation were as follows:
 
<UL>
<LI>maximum rate of N fertilization 168 kg nitrogen per hectare

<LI>maximum rate of irrigation water 300 mm per crop  
<LI>residual nitrate from previous crop assumed to be 60 kg N03-
nitrogen in the soil profile
<LI>nitrogen fertilizer incorporated at a 50 mm depth on June
5 at 168 kg per hectare, and August 28 at 128 kg per hectare;
40 kg nitrogen per hectare was applied with irrigation water on
October 5  
<LI>each crop was furrow irrigated in equal amounts six times
during the growing seasons at 10- to 14-day intervals  
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Model simulations were run with decreasing irrigation and fertilizer
rates (100% to 0% of maximum at 10% increments). Economic modeling
involved calculating profit as the difference in revenue from
lettuce yield and marginal costs of applied water and fertilizer.
 
<H3>Results </H3>

<P>
The authors present break point analyses for water and fertilizer
inputs (figures 1 and 2). These data show that &quot;leaching
of nitrate was most effectively reduced up to 5O percent of the
'normal' quantity of applied irrigation water, and at 65 percent
of applied fertilizer nitrogen.&quot; Beyond these break points,
reductions in irrigation and fertilizer rates become less effective
at reducing nitrate leaching.  <BR>

<P>
A combined analysis of the two variables showed that both fertilizer
nitrogen and irrigation water could be reduced up to 50 percent
of normal with no reduction in yield. The<I> </I>authors stress,
however, that water and fertilizer management go hand-in-hand:
If, for example, nitrogen fertilization is reduced without reducing
irrigation water, crop uptake efficiency goes down because nitrate
is flushed past the root system. <BR>

<P>
The 50 percent reduction in fertilizer and irrigation water is
also the point at which profit is maximized. Optimal rates were
determined to be 150 mm of applied irrigation water and 84 kg
nitrogen per ha per crop. Implementation of these management practices
would reduce nitrate leaching by about 75 percent. <BR>

<P>
<I> </I>The authors caution that this modeling work is still in
the developmental stages, and that calibration of the model was
conducted using data from a lettuce crop grown under near-optimal,
disease-free conditions. Areas that require further study include:
the effect of corky root disease on water and nitrogen uptake,
crop quality considerations, and the low salinity tolerance of
head lettuce.  <BR>

<H1> Marin Coastal Watershed Project: </H1>
<H3>A Cooperative Approach to Adapting Nonpoint Source <BR>
Pollution Guidelines to Local Conditions-Part 2</H3>
<I>by Ellen Rilla and Stephanie Larson, UCCE</I><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><I>[Editor's Note:  This is the second part of a two-part article on the Marin Coastal Watershed Enhancement Project, which was coordinated by Ellen Rilla, UC Cooperative Extension director, Marin/Sonoma counties, and Stephanie Larson, UC Cooperative Extension livestock and range management advisor, Marin/Sonoma counties, and involved the work of many individuals in UC Cooperative Extension, the agricultural community, natural resources agencies, and environmental groups.  Funding for the project was provided by the Marin Community Foundation.  Part 1, which  appeared in Sustainable Agriculture, Vol. 8, No. 3, Summer 1996, page 4,  detailed the deteriorating condition of riparian habitat in coastal Marin County, and the fact that agricultural practices are often cited as a primary cause of this habitat degradation.  It noted how a significant aspect of the project was the cooperative effort of local government agencies and private support groups working together as a team to assist landowners with nonpoint source pollution, or NPS, issues.  A 30-member advisory committee made up of community representatives, producer groups from shellfish growers to dairy operators, regulatory and resource agencies, and environmental organizations provided general guidance and oversight.  In this concluding article on the Marin project, the authors describe landowner outreach, local compliance, and next steps.]</I></FONT>

<H3>Landowner Outreach</H3>
<FONT SIZE=+3>P</FONT>roject input from agricultural landowners has been obtained through personal interviews and informal public meetings.  Key landowners, who either control large tracts of land or are outgoing and influential, were contacted and personally interviewed to assess their knowledge of nonpoint source pollution regulations and gain a feeling for the types of support that are most needed.  Many of these interviews were conducted by a local rancher.<BR>
Following the interviews, two informal potluck meetings were held for livestock producers and dairy producers.  A local rancher helped conduct the meetings, providing a comfortable environment for other landowners to express their opinions.  These meetings provided a forum for members of the two producer  groups to air concerns and discuss issues.<BR>
Primary concerns discussed at these meetings included: a feeling of over regulation; confusion over regulatory agency roles; lack of understanding of water quality laws; lack of understanding of management problems that contribute to NPS pollution; and concern that agriculture has been unfairly targeted.  The greatest needs for assistance include: financial support to make improvements; political support; technical assistance; coordinated information on all aspects of NPS pollution; and the improvements themselves, such as fencing, water source development and erosion repairs.<BR>
The meetings were effective in generating a feeling of unity.  They also encouraged farmers and ranchers to take a proactive stance in planning for nonpoint source pollution regulations.<BR>

<H3>Local Compliance</H3>
After staff gathered information from landowners they developed several workshops in response to the need for technical information.  They planned and implemented a ranch planning short course held in the evenings and on weekends for 50 ranchers.  The course included setting short- and long-term goals, a facilities and natural resources inventory, assessment of their current ranch condition and planned management and monitoring practices.  Participation was high and the evaluations indicated that the participants found the workshop to be worthwhile.  Based on specific feedback, workshop leaders were also able to incorporate more materials into the ranch plan workbook. Since the workshops,  several ranchers have completed their plans and others have requested copies of completed plans and suggested future workshops be held.  Several evaluation comments stated that participants never expected to find the ranch planning as beneficial to their overall operating goals, since they came with the expectation that they were just attempting to comply with NPS pollution regulations.  They indicated that they were very pleased with the results.<BR>
Project products also include the development of technical handouts, a creek care guide, and an accompanying report assessing watershed condition and recommending future watershed enhancement projects.  The technical fact sheets were adapted from materials gathered from water quality NPS pollution efforts around the state and nation, including the Tillamook project in Oregon and Chesapeake Bay on the east coast. The fact sheets include the names of all cooperating resource agencies with master copies provided to each agency for use with clientele.  Again, the idea is to provide information with a common and coordinated voice.  In response to landowner requests for information on NPS pollution issues, the Marin Agricultural Land Trust (MALT), a private agricultural conservation organization, began publishing an informational newsletter for all rural landowners in Marin County.  Staff representing the various resource agencies contributed articles.  MALT has agreed to continue this important communication link with landowners.<BR>
The creek care guide is being distributed to rural landowners and residents of the project area.  The agency team participated in its development and has received copies for use with their constituents.  One positive offshoot of this coordinated effort is the expressed interest of the Urban Run-Off Program in the eastern, more urban portion of Marin County to adapt and use some of the project materials.  This program is a multi-jurisdictional effort to comply with the urban aspects of NPS pollution. <BR>
The final product is the 80-page report and action plan that describes the project area historically in terms of water quality and work done to date, and proposes future action in the watersheds.  The advisory committee worked in three half-day sessions over eight months to brainstorm, prioritize and finalize their recommendations for future action.  They worked in small teams that included a broad cross-section of interests, from regulatory to environmental.  The report is the starting point for future watershed proposals, especially where foundation funding is sought.  The Marin Community Foundation will use the priorities set for future watershed projects as their funding guidelines. <BR>

<H3>Next Steps</H3>
At the beginning of the project, key factors for success were determined to hinge on the following:
<UL>
<LI>involvement of the agricultural community in project decision making 
<LI>addressing concerns and needs from landowner meetings and interviews	
<LI>regulatory agency recognition of local voluntary efforts
<LI>continued cooperation of support agencies in the team approach
<LI>willingness of landowners to recognize problems and be proactive in their compliance
</UL>
<BR>
Follow-up interviews 18 months later indicated that agencies, staff and landowners have become more aware of NPS pollution and what needs to be done. They all mentioned that just coming together and building consensus was an important accomplishment of the project.  Ranchers mentioned that there is a good balance of environmental, water quality and ag interests and that they truly wanted to improve their operations.  Ranchers asked for more workshops and technical assistance while agency and environmental representatives and staff had a wide range of suggestions about how to reach more people.  All of those interviewed indicated the need to continue this effort in some fashion after the formal project funding expired. <BR>
One shortcoming was the lack of information and assessment regarding economic considerations.  Most of our educational transfer efforts in the workshops and field days focused on the technical feasibility.  Do the expected benefits occurring from the investment in a management practice exceed the anticipated cost?  Is there sufficient cash flow to pay for the investment?  As a result of this, staff have applied for research funds to develop a cost-benefit analysis of varying practices for these specific watersheds. <BR>
The EPA is encouraging the use of their Watershed Protection Approach (WPA) to meet water quality goals.  One clear advantage of this approach is the fact that EPA favors funding projects that are watershed specific.  Additionally, regional water quality assessments are based on watershed boundaries, which often coincide with regulatory agency boundaries.  This approach could easily be married with the politically determined Resource Conservation District by encouraging watershed representatives to work directly with Resource Conservation Districts. <BR>
Both EPA and the State Water Resources Control Board recognize that NPS pollution compliance programs are best accomplished in partnerships at the local level.  The Marin County Resource Conservation District (MCRCD) is an obvious agency to look toward to carry out the priorities established in this project, since it has been operating watershed enhancement projects for 14 years and has a proven track record in working with landowners and obtaining funding.  Regional EPA staff have recently approached the MCRCD to develop operational working agreements between the district and selected agency partners.  It is hoped that these agreements will carry forward the work this project initiated. <BR>
A similar effort is just getting underway in the Russian River watershed in the county directly north.  Project coordinators have requested use of the materials and some staff time assisting them with organizing a similar collaborative process for their advisory committee and conducting the ranch planning and water quality workshops in that watershed. <BR>
More information can be obtained on this project and others through the California Watershed Projects Inventory.  The database and G.I.S. is located at a World Wide Web site <A HREF="http://ice.ucdavis.edu">http://ice.ucdavis.edu</A> and provides a tool for sharing watershed level projects throughout California.n <BR>

<H1>Hunger in the Heartland<BR>
</H1>
<P>
California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation.  1991<BR>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note: This study is part of a national effort by
the Washington, D.C. -based Food Research and Action Center to
document hunger in various regions of the country. The California
Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (CRLA) carried out the California
component of the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project
(CCHIP) in California's Central Valley. It was one of nine CCHiP
surveys conducted in different states across the country. CRLA
operates both statewide and within communities to address the
needs of California's low-income rural residents in the areas
of health and nutrition, housing, education, economic development,
labor and immigration..<BR>
</I>
<P>
In the midst of some of the richest farm areas in the world in
California's Central Valley, low-income families - many of them
farmworker families - struggle to survive. Hunger and poverty
stand in stark contrast to the Valley's economic recovery. Even
as farmworkers work to grow and harvest much of the country's
fruits and vegetables, returning billions of dollars to California's
economy, they and their families often do not have enough to eat.
These are some of the findings of <I>Hunger in the Heartland,
</I>the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation's study of
poverty and hunger among children of Fresno, Kings, Stanislaus
and Tulare counties.<BR>
<H3>Methodology</H3>
<P>
Project researchers used a questionnaire developed and field-tested
by the Connecticut Association for Human Services. This questionnaire
was designed to estimate the prevalence of hunger, defined as
&quot;the mental and physical condition that comes from not eating
enough food, due to insufficient economic, family or community
resources.&quot; The questionnaire also explored some of the socioeconomic
and demographic factors associated with hunger in some low-income
families. The CCHIP surveyed a sample of low-income families in
the four-county area. This sample was assumed to be representative
of all low-income families at or below 185% of the federal poverty
level with at least one child under 12. These low-income families
represent 13 percent of all households in the four-county area.
<BR>
<P>
The CCHIP staff randomly selected 12 census tracts, covering 13
communities for the survey area. Families in each census tract
with incomes below 185 percent of the 1989 poverty level were
then randomly chosen for the study. In total, trained community
residents interviewed 335 eligible families with at least one
child under age 12. There were more than 100 questions, which
focused on household food security and experience of hunger, family
size and structure, shopping and eating habits, participation
in food assistance programs, employment and family finances, and
children's health and health care.<BR>
<H3>Results</H3>
<P>
Responses to the survey document a clear pattern of hunger and
related nutritional and health problems among the children of
low-income families in California's Central Valley. More than
one- third of the study families face severe hunger, i.e. they
encounter serious problems getting enough food and they experience
regular food shortages (Figure 1).  These families answered &quot;yes&quot;
to five or more of the eight survey questions that dealt with
hunger. Ninety-seven percent of hungry families run out of money
for food an average of seven days per month. As many as 65,900
school-age children in the four-county area are hungry.<BR>
<P>
In addition to those families facing severe hunger, another 32
percent of the study families encounter periodic problems obtaining
enough food (Figure 1). They answered &quot;yes&quot; to at least
one of the questions that dealt with hunger. In total, over two-thirds
of families in the study reported at least one instance in the
last year when they did not have enough food to eat.<BR>
<P>
Hungry children in the CCHIP sample experience twice as many specific
health problems as children whose families are not hungry. These
problems include weight loss, fatigue, irritability and inability
to concentrate. Despite these problems, the study children are
not receiving even minimal health care. Twenty-three percent of
the children have no medical coverage at all. An additional 18
percent are not covered by MediCal, although they do pay for some
other health insurance. In total, 41 percent do not participate
in the state MediCal program despite the fact that all children
in families below 185 percent of poverty are eligible.<BR>
<P>
To cope with inadequate food, the hungry families surveyed have
various strategies: 98 percent buy less expensive food, 82 percent
get money from family and friends, 46 percent get food from friends
and relatives and 46 percent use commodities from the federal
government through local food banks and pantries (Figure 2).<BR>
<H3>What Contributes to Hunger?</H3>
<P>
The CCHIP study found that housing costs contribute to hunger.
The average CCHIP household spends 44 percent of its income on
shelter and 33 percent of hungry families spend more than half
of their total income on shelter. To avoid homelessness, families
pay housing costs and have little money left for food.<BR>
<P>
Another factor contributing to hunger is severe unemployment.
Unemployment in the four counties studied (11.3-12.4 percent)
is  over twice as high as the statewide average (5.3 percent).
Weather conditions, seasonality of agricultural work, plant closures
and mechanization contribute to joblessness in the Central Valley,
according to the study.<BR>
<P>
Although unemployment is higher than average for the state, the
majority (53 percent) of CCHIP households have at least one member
who works. Most of the employed respondents are farmworkers (51
percent). Although having a job helps, the average contributing
adult in CCHIP households cannot find steady work (at least 10
days/month) for four months/year. Barriers to full-time work among
respondents or contributing adults include: wanting to stay home
with children, lack of child care, inability to find a job, language
barriers, and lack of training and education.<BR>
<H3>Inadequacy of the Food Safety Net</H3>
<P>
Federally-funded food assistance programs are woefully inadequate
and private sector food programs do not bridge the gap to prevent
hunger, according to the study. The CCHIP survey found very low
rates of participation in most food programs due mainly to the
fact that families do not have access to them. The study suggests
that improved funding, outreach, implementation and benefit levels
would go far to prevent hunger in the Central Valley and other
rural areas.<BR>
<P>
The CCHIP survey found that the Food Stamp Program is badly underutilized
by low-income families with children in the Central Valley. Only
48 percent of the total sample participate compared to 58 percent
in the Michigan CCHIP, 61 percent in the Minnesota CCHIP and 69
percent in the Connecticut CCHIP. Of those who have not applied
for food stamps, 67 percent do not think their household is eligible.
Of these, 74 percent probably <I>are </I>eligible. Of those families
receiving food stamps, 39 percent are still hungry. One reason
is that food stamp allotments are inadequate to cover food needs.
In fact, families could only eat an average of two weeks per month
using food stamps.<BR>
<P>
Participation in the Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Food
Program (WIC) is also low. Only 30 percent of CCHIP families deemed
eligible are receiving WIC. Again, this figure is significantly
less than the percentage of eligible persons served by WIC in
other CCHIP study states (38 - 77 percent). The majority of study
participants (52 percent) do not receive WIC benefits because
they think they are not eligible. Yet, WIC does not deny participation
to undocumented families, and is mandated to target services to
migrant farmworkers who are a significant portion of this CCHIP
population.
<H3>Conclusions &amp; Recommendations</H3>
<P>
The study concludes that enormous social costs - in terms of health,
MediCal, education, welfare and youth guidance expenditures -
may be on the horizon for California's low-income children unless
adequate food and nutrition can be provided. &quot;Making sure
that all
<P>
families have enough to eat is the first, most basic step in implementing
any plan to fight poverty.&quot; Unless hunger is alleviated,
improvements in housing, education and jobs will not make much
of a difference, the study maintains. Long-term solutions must
involve an improved standard of living through better wages, benefits,
public assistance, housing, education and transportation. However,
the report's recommendations focus on shorter-term solutions involving
food and nutrition programs as a first and essential step. The
study suggests improvements in five federal food and nutrition
programs as follows:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Improve outreach, benefits and lower barriers to access in
the Food Stamp Program.
<LI>Expand California WIC to serve all eligible women and children.
<LI>Mandate provision of School Breakfast to California's neediest
children.
<LI>Triple participation in the Summer Food Program to prevent
seasonal hunger.
<LI>Expand and improve coordination of private sector emergency
food programs.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<I>Hunger in the Heartland </I>concludes, &quot;The choice is
ours: hunger can either be alleviated and prevented, or allowed
to fester. If we do not invest in prevention, we will pay a much
higher price in the years ahead&quot;<BR>

</H1>
<P>
Five projects focusing on the social, economic and public policy
analysis that address the sustainability of California food and
agricultural systems have been awarded $75,000 in grant money
from the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program
(SAREP), according to <B>Bill Liebhardt</B>, program director.
 <B>David Campbell</B>, SAREP economic and public policy analyst,
coordinated the grant process.  The five projects include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>a study to identify and analyze strategies including crop
diversification and labor sharing which would contribute to a
stable agricultural work force.  Many California farm workers
are part of an unstable, seasonal labor market which results in
low annual incomes for workers and high turnover and uncertainty
for farmers, and contributes to the development of unstable, poverty-ridden
communities.  Crop diversification, an environmentally sound practice
which is encouraged in sustainable agriculture, presents an opportunity
for improving labor practices.  By incorporating consideration
of labor management practices in production planning as well as
issues of weed and pest control and marketing, labor conditions
may be improved while contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness
and environmental soundness of agricultural production.   Strategies
will be identified from: three farmers who offer extended or year-round
employment and have succeeded in modifying their cropping systems,
analysis of crop rotation data for employment management, interviews
with 30 San Joaquin County growers, and case studies of labor
and information sharing systems offering year-round employment.
 Strategies will be developed further through regional focus groups
with farm advisors, farmers and non-profit farmer organizations
and local businesses.  Results will be published and presented
to farmers in seminars.  Investigators: <B>Suzanne Vaupel</B>,
research agricultural economist, Sacramento; <B>Gary Johnston</B>,
San Joaquin County Cooperative Extension director; <B>Gregory
Billikopf,</B> personnel management farm advisor, Modesto; <B>Melissa
Cadet</B>, Trans Tech Management, Sacramento; <B>Franz Kegel</B>,
retired farm advisor, Stockton; <B>Steve Sutter</B>, personnel
management farm advisor, Fresno.  Cooperators: <B>Tom Haller</B>,
executive director, California Association of Family Farmers;
and three farmer-cooperators from throughout the state. $20,000
for two years.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a comparison of the economic benefits, energy costs and social
values of different vegetable production farming practices at
the Rural Development Center (RDC) in Salinas, CA. Farmers at
the RDC are predominantly Mexican farm laborers enrolled in a
three year production and marketing training program in which
low-input production practices are emphasized.  The effect of
these alternative practices on the short- and long-term well-being
of the enrolled families and the surrounding rural community will
be determined and analyzed based on information from the fields,
interviews and workshops.  Investigators: <B>Paul L. Gersper</B>,
Department of Soil Science, UC Berkeley; <B>Miguel Altieri</B>,
Department of Entomological Sciences, Division of Biological Control,
UC Berkeley.  Cooperator: <B>Nestor Marin</B>, RDC director of
farm operations, Salinas.  $20,000 for two years.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the formation of a coalition to ensure the vitality of sustainable
agriculture in Santa Cruz County.  Agriculture is a $196 million
dollar industry in Santa Cruz County, second only to tourism.
 It is threatened by urban growth and development, groundwater
depletion, and the movement of agricultural operations overseas
where costs are lower.  The community-based coalition will work
with UC Santa Cruz to pool resources, expertise and political
strength to assess needs, devise solutions and implement strategies
for change.  The project also aims to improve agriculture's environmental
responsibility and economic strength, increase its responsiveness
to the needs of those who work within the industry as well as
to local communities, and strengthen its links to the local community.
 Investigators: <B>Stephen Gliessman</B>, Agroecology Program,
UC Santa Cruz;<B> James Pepper</B>, Environmental Studies, UC
Santa Cruz.  $17,000 for two years.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a survey identifying the logistical, social and regulatory
barriers to sustainable food in Alameda County's food marketplace.
 A task force including wholesale and retail merchants, trade
association members, consumers and environmentalists will be assembled
to determine concerns of the food community about barriers to
the movement of sustainable agricultural produce in the marketplace.
 A survey will be conducted to determine specific barriers.  As
part of the information dissemination plan, a public forum will
be convened to discuss the barriers and identify solutions.  Investigator:
<B>Valerie Pelto</B>, executive director, Alameda County Food
Planning Council.  $15,000 for two year project.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>five workshops throughout Humboldt and Del Norte counties
to address the topic of sustainable forestry management options
for small landowners.  The goal of sustainable forestry is shared
by forest landowners, legislators and the public, yet is often
difficult to define and achieve.  Major changes in policies for
the management of California's 14.4 million acres of private forest
land are evident in new and proposed legislation.  Past laws and
regulations which influenced cutting practices combined with natural
events including fire and flood have resulted in many forest lands
in need of restoration and improvement.  The costs of restoration
plus the costs imposed by legislative restrictions often discourage
small landowners from long-term planning.  The workshops will
look at current legislation and policy instruments for implementing
sustainable forestry.  A dialogue between landowners, regulators
and legislators will be encouraged.   Investigator:  <B>Kimberly
Rodrigues</B>, UC Cooperative Extension forest advisor, Humboldt
and Del Norte counties. $3,000 for one year.

<H1><U><I>From the Director</I></U> - The Problems of Science
</H1>
<P>
Pesticides in water, animal waste problems, automobile pollution,
and the lack of urban recycling are examples of the &quot;loop&quot;
not being closed in our human systems.  These problems are often
laid at the doorstep of the scientific community.  As scientific
technology has become more complex, however, technology may only
solve part of the problem, and in some cases may create problems.
 There are limits to what technology and science can do.<BR>
<P>
How can science improve the way it deals with contemporary issues?
 The answer to part of the question, I  believe, lies in understanding
how science is organized.  Much of what we believe and how we
operate is a result of thinking that was advanced by Bacon, Descartes,
and Newton during the 1500s to 1700s.  They believed scientists
should seek knowledge to dominate and control nature.  They also
believed all problems could be broken into pieces.  Reductionism
in science was the belief that all aspects of complex phenomena
could be understood by reducing them to their constituent parts.
 The material universe was considered to behave like a machine.
Natural and human-made systems are not machines, yet much of our
science starts with this premise.  As long as we continue to study
pieces of a particular problem, and not examine the whole system,
we will come up short.<BR>
<P>
Those of us in academic institutions and other agencies attempting
to deal with current problems need to understand that the &quot;small
box of reductionism&quot; will continue to cause credibility problems
for the scientific community and any &quot;answers&quot; it finds.
 If as much effort were invested in creative systems approach
research as is expended for reductionist research, the result
could be more useable information for those of us attempting to
manage the vast and complex problems we face.  The agricultural
systems conference presented at UC Davis last November (see article
this page), which focused on relationships between production
practices and social and environmental issues, was a positive
step toward broadening the way we look at the world's food production
system.  <I><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>, director, UC Sustainable Agriculture

<H1>Organic Agriculture Requires Certification, Marketing</H1>
<P>
<I>by Mark Van Horn, program director, UC Davis Student Experimental
Farm<BR>
</I>
<P>
Organic farming and alternative farming practices have moved from
the outer fringes of agriculture to the mainstream in the last
ten years.  Although concepts such as integrated pest management
have been generally accepted, until recently the agricultural
establishment was skeptical of organic farming, which lacked technical
and financial support from public and private institutions.<BR>
<P>
The 1980s brought many changes to agriculture.  In the last five
years particularly, economic, social, political and environmental
factors have increased support for organic farming.  Although
still a relatively small part of California agriculture, organic
acreage and sales have increased at annual rates exceeding 50
percent since 1986.  California farmgate sales of organic products
were estimated at $100 million in 1989.
<H3>Positive, Negative Influences</H3>
<P>
Many factors are contributing to the rapid increase in organic
production.  Positive factors include increased consumer demand,
a larger more effective marketing and distribution system, new
opportunities for processing raw organic commodities, and the
premiums frequently paid to growers for organic products.<BR>
<P>
Additionally, growers have found many agricultural chemicals less
attractive because of their effects on the environment and health,
increased regulation, and removal of some of these products from
the market.  Certain chemicals have been less useful due to the
development of pesticide resistant pest populations, pest resurgence
and secondary pest outbreaks.  Growers also have access to more
and better information about non-chemical farming.<BR>
<P>
Growers contemplating a switch to organic farming should be aware
that there is more to successful organic production methods than
throwing away pesticides and  labeling products &quot;organic&quot;.
  Production practices, marketing, and regulatory requirements
are different for organic farming.  California law requires that
any product labeled or sold as organic must meet specific requirements.
 In general, the law prohibits the use of synthetic materials
in the production, handling or processing of organic crops.  It
places restrictions and prohibitions on the use of drugs, hormones,
feed additives, and preservatives used in connection with organic
livestock products.<BR>
<P>
The California Organic Foods Act, originally enacted in 1979,
was revised and expanded in 1990.  The new law retains many of
the restrictions on materials and production practices, but also
includes important changes.  The most significant changes relate
to the length of time that a crop, field or animal must be managed
consistent with the law before it can be considered organic. 
Under the old law, an annual crop could be considered organic
if the field in which it was planted had been managed organically
for 12 months prior to planting.  The current law changes that
waiting period to 24 months in 1995 and 36 months in 1996.  The
change will make California standards more consistent with other
laws in the United States, most of which require a three-year
waiting period.  The federal 1990 Farm Bill included the Organic
Production Act which requires a three-year transition period effective
October 1, 1993.<BR>
<P>
Another major change in the California law requires that all organic
producers register their operations with the county agricultural
commissioner.  Registration requirements will include a registration
fee, precise maps of production areas, and records of production
inputs.  Third party certification, including independent inspections
by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) or other organizations
to confirm that farming practices meet organic standards will
still be optional, although requirements for certification will
be more elaborate than for registration, and all certification
organizations will need state approval of their registration procedures.
<H3>Marketing</H3>
<P>
Marketing considerations are important for organic growers.  Stories
of growers receiving large premiums for organic products have
heightened producers' interest in the organic market.  Although
an &quot;organic premium&quot; is still common, economic planning
based upon the assumption of hearty premiums is risky.  The organic
premium fluctuates significantly between crops, seasons, and specific
markets, and may not be available if the organic market for a
commodity is saturated.  The organic market for most commodities
is still very small, and it may be flooded easily by a relatively
small amount of product.  Additionally, the large premiums that
some organic growers receive is at least partly due to other factors,
including the use of special crop varieties, or harvesting and
handling practices (e.g. tree- or vine-ripened produce).<BR>
<P>
Even when no other special practices are employed, organic products
are specialty items and require special marketing.  Producers
not accustomed to the time and energy required for marketing may
have difficulty adjusting to the organic market, or recognizing
the critical importance of marketing in successful organic operations.
 Producers must research potential markets for size, consistency,
and competition.  They must match their production to their market.
 The small-scale (health food stores, restaurants) and large-scale
(super market chains) organic markets are distinct, and variability
exists within these markets.  Targeting and developing markets
prior to the start of production can prevent expensive mistakes.
<BR>
<P>
The conversion to organic farming is not a matter of trading the
pesticide rig for a manure spreader. The word &quot;organic&quot;
implies thinking of the whole farming system.   Production practices,
marketing, regulatory considerations, and philosophy are important
parts of any farming operation.  Those farmers interested in organic
farming will probably be most successful if they consider all
its implications.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">To facilitate the transition to
sustainable agriculture, farmers need accurate information about
the benefits, costs and risks associated with &quot;conventional&quot;
and &quot;alternative&quot; systems. To generate this information,
research must eventually be conducted at the whole-farm level.
By broadening the boundaries of investigation, researchers are
able to critically evaluate the success of farming practices and
their effects on the environment, as well as the special requirements
for adapting these practices to farms in various locations. A
SAREP-funded research project comparing conventional, low-input
and organic farming systems is an excellent example of this research.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The goal of this research project
is to describe and quantify the environmental and economic consequences
of the transition from conventional to low-input and organic farming
systems typical of the southern Sacramento Valley. The research
team is multidisciplinary (members listed at the end of the article),
and participating farmers and farm advisor</FONT><B> </B><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">play
a key role in guiding the management decisions applied to the
various production systems. The project was initiated in 1989,
and is located on 28 acres at the UC Davis Agronomy Farm.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3>Rotations and Experimental Design</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">The main experiment occupies about
20 acres and compares four cropping systems: 1) a conventional
two-year rotation; 2) a conventional four-year rotation; 3) a
low-input four-year rotation; and 4) an organic four-year rotation.
The four systems are arranged in plots with four replicates of
each system. All the cropping systems include processing tomatoes,
a high-value commodity grown on approximately 310,000 acres in
California (1990 data). Other cash crops grown include wheat,
safflower, field corn, and beans. In addition, winter-spring cover
crops are grown in the low-input and organic systems. The specific
rotations used in the different management systems are shown in
Table 1.<BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Both conventional systems are
managed using practices typical for the southern Sacramento Valley.
The two-year conventional system is practiced by farmers when
short-term profit must be maximized. The low-input system includes
a winter cover crop prior to planting of tomatoes, safflower,
corn and beans. While trying to reduce dependency on non-renewable
resources, synthetic fertilizers or pesticides may be used in
the low-input system to maintain the profitability of the operation.
The organic system is managed according to the certification requirements
of California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF); only approved
fertilizers and pesticides are used. &quot;Best farmer&quot; management
practices are used in all systems. For example, insect and disease
management decisions for all systems are based on periodic monitoring
of pest levels and no pesticides are applied until economic threshold
levels are exceeded.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">A companion research area of eight
acres is being used to test alternative grain and cover crop legumes
that could be used as cash crops, as winter and summer cover crops,
or in intercropping systems in California. Along with this effort,
investigators are evaluating various kinds of agricultural equipment
for use in reduced tillage operations and innovative cover crop
management.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<H3>Preliminary Observations<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Data collected during the first
four years of the experiment include measurements of: crop growth,
yield and quality; soil biology; soil fertility; soil organic
matter levels; soil water infiltration rates; weed biomass; disease
levels; pest and beneficial insect populations; and economic performance.
From these data, researchers have been able to make some preliminary
observations about the performance of the various cropping systems.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Soil fertility and weed management
have been identified as the most important factors limiting yields
in the organic and low-input systems. Researchers have altered
production practices to address these constraints. Organic and
low-input tomatoes, for example, are now transplanted instead
of direct-seeded. This practice gives tomatoes a head-start in
competing against weeds and allows for the use of more efficient
mechanical cultivation techniques. Supplemental manure fertilizers
have also improved yields in the organic and low-input systems.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Other problems thus far have not
been a major constraint for any of the production systems. However,
the soil-borne pathogen </FONT><I>Verticillium dahliae has </I><FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">been
consistently higher in the conventional two-year system than in
the others. Researchers will be collecting additional data to
determine whether or not the disease organism will actually decrease
tomato yields in this rotation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Organic matter added through cover
cropping and manuring has resulted in small increases in soil
organic matter levels in the organic and low-input plots. This
increase seems to be improving soil physical structure as shown
by trends toward increased water infiltration rates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Preliminary results suggest that
similar crop yields may be obtained when &quot;best farmer&quot;
management practices are used in each of the different systems.
Similar yields, however, do not necessarily translate into similar
profits. Year-to-year variations in production costs for each
system, and the modest price premiums offered for organically
grown commodities should also be considered. During the 1991 growing
season, for example, gross returns, per acre operating costs,
and net returns above total costs were all highest in the conventional
two-year rotation (all crops combined). The 1992 season, by contrast,
showed that the organic system had the highest figures in each
of these same categories. Results of this study support what other
studies have found: The transition period (as evidenced by the
performance of the low-input system) carries significant risk:
There are no price premiums for &quot;transitional commodities,&quot;
costs of production may be high, growers are generally on the
steep part of the learning curve, and the new production system
can be ecologically unstable for a time. Recommendations for minimizing
this risk is a key objective as experimentation and analysis continue.
<BR>

</FONT>
<H3>Specific Research Objectives<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Narrow">Differences between the four cropping
systems and the relationships among various parameters observed
during the first four years of the experiment have suggested a
number of more specific research questions to pursue. These are

<H1>The Farmer's Transition<BR>
</H1>
<P>
In the last issue of <B>Sustainable Agriculture News</B>, we discussed
agriculture's agenda, and the precarious position growers find
themselves in. As a result of changing markets, legislation and
other factors, many farmers are rethinking their production and
marketing structures so they can move toward more environmentally
safe practices. Some are changing their production systems because
they see an expanding market or a niche for food produced in a
different fashion. Others will respond as legislation or other
forces beyond their control require them to change to stay in
business. Eventually, most growers may be faced with very significant
changes in their production systems. For some, change will be
an opportunity- for others, it will create problems. We have a
tendency to resist change because it moves us into unknown directions
- but one way or another, change is upon agriculture, and many
farmers will be involved in these changes.<BR>
<H3>What Are the Options?</H3>
<P>
So the question for many is: How do we continue to produce and
stay in business? What are the options for you, as a farmer, as
you face a transition? Many of the decisions regarding the transition
to more environmentally sound farming practices will be business
decisions. If you are going to change, consider the scale of the
modifications in the next few years. You may make major changes
on your farm all at once, or you can take a small parcel of land
and make modest changes the first year and learn about the management
and environmental problems on your particular site.<BR>
<H3>Business Risks</H3>
<P>
There are risks in all business decisions, so some of you may
be more comfortable with small changes the first year, while others
may take higher risks and make rapid changes in production systems.
You must weigh marketing and legislative factors, your management
skills and farming environment before you make a judgment that
is appropriate for you.  No matter what your decision, however,
you would be wise to start moving in the direction of change as
prudently as possible.
<P>
No one has all the answers to the production and marketing problems
that you will face as your farming system changes. Therefore,
it is important to start and learn from your experiences. Even
if you only make changes on one acre, that experience will be
invaluable in the coming years as the production system changes
to meet different demands and needs. Each production system, each
environment, each grower will have a different set of circumstances
and problems.
<H3>Where to Start</H3>
<P>
Even though there is no way to set out a complete recipe for change
in this column, some general guidelines can be shared.<BR>
<P>
Analyze your current market and production systems and identify
the constraints. Take a look at the most limiting factors now
and think about ways in which they might be addressed if some
pesticides or other tools you use are eliminated. As a general
rule, inputs cannot be removed from a conventional farming system
without other changes being required. Not understanding that could
lead to real problems. A total systems view of your production
practices must be taken. It may mean changing some production
practices very significantly, or it may just mean some minor adjustments.
Your first attempt at managing pesticide or fertilizer inputs
might be to strictly monitor fields and gradually reduce the inputs.
You might try changes in two or three different ways, in small
areas, so that you can see how different management strategies
work in your environment.<BR>
<P>
The main decision for you to make is to <I>begin </I>the process
on your own operation. The details of what you do may not be as
important in getting started. If major legislative changes take
place in the next two or three years which enormously restrict
your use of chemical inputs, a year or two head start on even
a small part of your acreage will be very important.<BR>
<P>
What a farmer needs now is an early and flexible start on transition
planning, and the ability to learn from each year's experience.
If you are a farmer, you will be helping <I>yourself </I>by planning
ahead. You will be setting your own agenda. - <B>Bill Liebhardt</B>,

<H1>UC SAREP HONORED AS SUSTAINABLE MODEL<BR>
</H1>
<P>
UC SAREP has been recognized as a model environmental program
by Renew America, a non-profit environmental education organization,
and chosen as a case study for state sustainable agriculture programs
by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).<BR>
<P>
The Renew America recognition resulted from SAREP's participation
in &quot;Searching for Success,&quot; a national campaign to identify,
reward and promote successful environmental programs.  Programs
identified in the search are reviewed by the technical staff of
national environmental organizations and are included in the Environmental
Success Index, a directory designed to provide the public with
working solutions to pressing environmental problems.<BR>
<P>
Americans For Safe Food, a project of CSPI, profiled SAREP in
an extensive case study which is being distributed to promote
similar programs in other states. SAREP was identified as a model
of sustainable agriculture research and education programs. Copies
of the case study are available for $5 by writing Legislative
Kits/ASF, 1875 Connecticut Ave. NW Suite 300, Washington, DC 20009-5728.

<H1>From the Director:  Advisory Committees Provide Perspective
<!--Advisory Committees Provide Perspective --><BR>
</H1>

<P>
When legislation was passed requesting the university to create
the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program
in 1987 (SB872, Petris), it included the directive to form two
advisory committees to advise program staff on planning, administration
and competitive grants. The Technical Advisory Committee is made
up of individuals from within the UC system, while the Public
Advisory Committee consists of Californians from outside the university.

<P>
The people on these committees have been very helpful to SAREP.
They have made important suggestions and provided useful advice
on our competitive grants. They have also offered invaluable guidance
on short- and long-range planning issues. A wide diversity of
people is represented on both committees, which is intentional,
as &quot;sustainable agriculture&quot; is a very broad subject.

<P>
There is not always complete agreement among committee members,
as there rarely is when individuals from diverse backgrounds work
together. A case in point was the 1990 negotiation about funding
the 100-year farming systems project at UC Davis, known as the
Long Term Research on Agricultural Systems (LTRAS) project. Disagreements
among committee members regarding the funding of that project
were a result of honest differences of opinion. In the final analysis,
the LTRAS project was improved by intense debate. That debate
also sent an important message to SAREP staff about improving
the ways in which we deal with differences of opinion. Partly
as a result of the LTRAS discussions, SAREP staff members have
devoted time to facilitation training, including sessions with
UC Cooperative Extension advisor Jim Brenner, which has helped
our advisory committee meetings (and many other meetings) run
more smoothly and effectively. We still air differences of opinion,
but we know how to lead these discussions in productive, non-confrontational
directions.
<P>
Our committee members have always provided helpful, thoughtful
comments. <B>Bill Rains</B>, professor of agronomy and range science
at UC Davis, provided important leadership when SAREP first began,
and was an important advocate of long-term natural resource research.
At least seven years ago Yolo County farmer <B>Fran DuBois</B>
supported the idea that SAREP's research experiments be brought
to farmers' fields rather than doing them at UC field locations,
because of the &quot;reality check&quot; that actual farm fields
provide. Kern County farmer <B>Jack Pandol</B> advised that we
use the case study approach in our research projects, similar
to the approach used in business schools. He believes well-documented
case studies are very worthwhile, and provide information farmers
find helpful. Kern County farmer <B>Steve Pavich</B> recommended
that we needed to provide more information on soil fertility.
Santa Cruz County farmer <B>Kay Thornley</B> and Yolo County farmer
<B>Kathy Barsotti</B> urged us to support projects that acknowledge
the importance of labor. California State University, Sacramento
philosophy professor <B>Stan Dundon</B> asked us to consider the
importance of ethics in agricultural research projects and educational
activities. <B>Maren Hansen</B>, former director of the Santa
Barbara County Safe Food Project, and Santa Barbara County Cooperative
Extension Director <B>Larry Yee</B> underscored the value of including
broad community coalitions in the discussion of food safety issues.
Plumas/Sierra counties Cooperative Extension Director <B>Holly
George</B> has encouraged SAREP to understand the importance of
economic diversification for communities in timber- and cattle-dependent
areas. Amador County Director <B>Donna Hirschfelt</B> emphasized
the huge responsibilities of farm advisors, who are operating
in an era of dwindling resources. Agriculture writer <B>Sibella
Kraus</B> made the case for community gardens and agriculture
education in the context of our program. Sonoma County farm advisor
<B>Dan Desmond's</B> perspective on educating the urban population
about the realities of food and fiber production was very useful.
Tehama County ranch manager <B>Frank Dawley</B> has championed
the importance of beef cattle management in watershed research.
San Diego County farmer <B>Bill Brammer</B> stressed the importance
of funding research showing why and how organic farming methods
work, and studies of the conversion of conventional agriculture
to organic production. <B>Jim Grieshop</B>, community education
specialist in the UC Davis Department of Human and Community Development,
provided invaluable information from his surveys documenting farmers'
processes during the transition. <B>Duncan McMartin</B>, Extension
Specialist emeritus at UC Davis' Veterinary Medicine Extension
Unit, was particularly helpful in animal welfare issues. Sonoma/Marin
counties Cooperative Extension Director <B>Ellen Rilla</B> has
stressed the importance of working with local groups to solve
public policy issues. Monterey County farmer <B>George Work</B>
asked SAREP to strongly consider the importance of the entire
farm family in production agriculture decision-making, while <B>Lupe
Sandoval</B>, pesticide safety educator for the UC Statewide Integrated
Pest Management Project, made sure that farmworker input was considered
in our funded projects. I haven't named every member of SAREP's
committees, but we have learned from them all, and they have contributed
vastly to the program's charge to serve California's extensive
agricultural community. All of their suggestions and expertise
have been helpful in providing us guidelines for the future.<BR>

<P>
It is extremely useful for people inside and outside the UC to
sit around the table and listen to each other. In discussions
about research projects or about issues facing California agriculture,
we need to have diverse perspectives in order to make sure that
our decisions reflect the needs of the state. We try to reach
consensus among our advisory committee members so that this diverse
group of individuals can feel they have had an impact and have
been heard. There are many opinions about how we ought to deal
with present and future issues in California, and we need to provide
a way for these perspectives to be heard. We hope that is what
we are doing with our committees, and we salute those who have
given and continue to give their valuable input<I>.-<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>,

<I> </I>HortTechnology 3(2):128-136. 1993<BR>

<P>
This article presents an overview of some of the current issues
affecting the sustainability of fruit production around the world.
 The authors note that &quot;'sustainability' has emerged as a
new paradigm by which fruit production systems and practices are
judged.&quot; They define sustainable farming systems as those
which conserve resources, provide adequate food and fiber, optimize
crop output, and are profitable, supporting both the farmer and
viable rural communities.
<H3>Fruit Production Systems</H3>

<P>
The authors examine three systems of fruit production: traditional
fruit growing and gathering, traditional family farms, and modern
fruit production systems.  Traditional fruit growing and gathering
appear to be a model of sustainability, using minimal external
inputs and having endured for centuries.  Some fruits, such as
Brazil nuts, are still commercially harvested this way, and people
in many parts of the world use traditional systems for subsistence.
 These systems, however, do not meet the food needs of increasing
human populations and are being threatened by deforestation. 
Traditional family farming operations were common until the mid-1900s.
 These systems were often highly diversified, with fruit production
being only one component.  Modern production systems (whether
on family farms or corporate farms) tend to be more capital-intensive
and use more synthetic chemical inputs than in the past.  Modern
production systems are more profitable than the traditional systems,
but the demands on today's farms are also greater.  Trees must
be early-bearing and fruit must pass the scrutiny of the marketplace.
 In important fruit-growing regions, the usual practice is to
reestablish orchards continuously.  However, replant problems
often develop with successive plantings.  According to the authors,
&quot;The ability to replant fruits successfully .. without extensive
modification is itself a good test of the sustainability of prior
production practices.&quot; With the phase-out of methyl bromide,
for example, the sustainability of fruit production in some areas
is questionable without effective substitutes.<BR>

<H3>Sustainability Issues in Fruit Production</H3>

<P>
Growing perennial fruit crops has many advantages in resource
conservation, and some modem practices enhance agricultural sustainability.
 For example, tree roots, leaf litter, and cover crops improve
soil quality, especially on hillsides.  Fruit crops can also provide
a relatively rich habitat for a diversity of plant and animal
species, which can aid in pest management.  But fruit producers
are also faced with a number of challenges.<BR>

<P>
Because fruit crops tend to be located on land of high value,
they are often threatened by <B>urban and suburban sprawl.  </B>California's
Central Valley is currently a major battle ground for land and
water.  Unfortunately, many growers oppose protection of land
from development in order to retain the option of selling the
land for a high price.  According to the authors, this is an example
in which the farming system may be sustainable, but it is unable
to withstand external socioeconomic pressures.<BR>

<P>
A significant threat to the sustainability of modern fruit production
is its extensive <B>reliance </B>on <B>pesticides and fertilizers.
 </B>This reliance stems in part from consumer demand for blemish-free
fruit.  Other market and regulatory forces are discouraging agrichemical
usage.  The future of many pesticides in fruit production is questionable
as a result of the increased cost of producing them, stricter
regulations, and rapid development of biochemical resistance to
pesticides.  Fungicides may be hardest hit, as many will be banned
with stricter enforcement of the &quot;Delaney Clause.&quot; The
loss of fungicides will likely favor fruit production in drier
areas, such as in California.  However, this concentration will
require that water be available and that fossil fuels and transportation
remain inexpensive to supply distant markets.<BR>

<P>
Lastly, <B>genetic resources </B>are critical to the long-term
sustainability of fruit crops.  Yet germplasm throughout the world
is being threatened by human population pressures.  Among the
fruit crops considered most at risk are apple, avocado, coconut,
mango, and pear.  Because of market pressures, genetically improved
cultivars often replace valuable landraces at the centers of origin
for many crops, further eroding the genetic pool.  Germplasm repositories
and collections contain only a small fraction of the existing
genetic diversity.  For some fruits, the only truly effective
way to conserve genetic resources is to protect large areas of
land from development at the centers of origin.  &quot;Sustainable
farming in any one country is thus intimately tied to the well-being
of other countries, and acknowledging this fact is perhaps the
biggest challenge facing the sustainable farming movement.&quot;
<BR>

<H3>New Paradigms in Horticulture</H3>

<P>
A primary goal in modern fruit production has been to increase
yields per unit of land and labor.  The authors point out that
this paradigm is giving way to a new one, i.e., reducing environmental
impacts and the use of external inputs, even at the cost of reduced
productivity.  &quot;The new agricultural paradigm is holistic,
emphasizing process as well as product, and quality more than
quantity.&quot; This shift coincides with a recognition that our
low food and fiber prices have not accounted for the true costs
in farming as a result of &quot;hidden&quot; government subsidies
such as low energy costs.<BR>

<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
Two of the issues discussed in this article are particularly relevant
to California.<BR>

<P>
<B>Water.</B>  Low annual rainfall (particularly in recent drought
years), a growing urban and suburban population, and increasing
recreational and environmental demands mean that less water is
available for irrigating crops.  Up to this point, annual crop
growers have borne the brunt of the water shortage by removing
land from production.  But some orchards, while remaining alive,
have lost vigor and production from insufficient water or irregular
watering schedules.  In response, farmers are relying more on
groundwater sources and are pumping it faster than it is being
recharged, a clearly unsustainable practice.  Technical developments
(e.g., maximizing irrigation efficiency, low-volume irrigation
systems) offer only a partial solution.  Political action based
on dialog among the various stakeholders is also needed. (See
review of land and water use reports below.)<BR>

<P>
<B>Pesticides</B>.  Pesticide use continues to be at the forefront
of concerns expressed in the marketplace and through the legislative
process.  In addition, many pests have developed biochemical resistance
to pesticides, leading some growers to implement &quot;resistance
management.&quot; With the problems surrounding agrichemicals,
a logical approach is to continue to work toward the development
of nonchemical alternatives, resistant cultivars, and more biologically
integrated cropping systems.<BR>

<I>Daniel Kemmis</I>
<P>
Houghton Mifflin Company, New York, NY.   1995
<P>
Daniel Kemmis, mayor of Missoula, Montana, is one of the nation's
most astute interpreters of civic life and the practice of citizenship.
This book, based on his experiences as mayor and his travels to
communities around the word, documents the small, patient and
encouraging steps by which citizens are reviving democracy and
building more sustainable communities. Two of the book's primary
arguments bear directly on the concerns of sustainable agriculture:
1) the idea that direct marketing arrangements, particularly farmers'
markets, are critical not merely for promoting local commercial
activity but also as vehicles for civic renewal, and 2) the view
that 'citistates' (i.e. cities and their surrounding region) are
and should be replacing the nation-state as the proper frame for
political and economic life as we head into the next century.
<P>
Kemmis begins his investigation of 'the good city' in what might
at first seem an unlikely place: the Missoula Farmers' Market.
Like many others, Kemmis admires the market as a center of commercial
activity which supports nearby farms, including those begun only
recently by Hmong residents. But  he sees more as well. Amidst
the bustle and activity of the market, Kemmis sees the organic
creation of a new civility in the city's life; civility which
is making possible a renewed and deeper sense of citizenship in
the community:<BR>

<P>
<I>I believe that the way people carry themselves at the Farmers'
Market is essentially the way of citizens, and that referring
to the market as civilized is an implicit recognition of this
fact. . . We know that most cities through most of history have
grown up around markets. We know that people needed gathering
places in order to exchange material surplus for deficiency, but
also to exchange news, stories, joy, and grief. . . . As Steve
weighs my broccoli and Lucy counts out my change, the whole history
of their farm and of our friendship is part and parcel of what
we exchange. Moving back through the market, back to the spot
where I'm to meet Abe, I  see in dozens of conversations around
me an interweaving of these life stories, and I find delight and
security in realizing once again that this fabric is Missoula,
my home, my city. (p. 5, 11)</I>
<P>
Kemmis believes that the cynicism and despair which mark today's
politics are a reflection of the lack of occasions for people
to be present with one another in ways that acknowledge their
wholeness as human beings, and their  common dependence on particular
places on the earth. Obscured by the groundcover of a more cynical
politics, human scale institutions like farmers' markets are quietly
but successfully reviving the civic sensitivities required for
democratic politics to thrive.
<P>
Drawing on the economic thought of Jane Jacobs, and the recent
political analysis of Neil Peirce, Kemmis suggests that the economic
and political viability of cities and their surrounding regions
is  increasingly tied to how creatively they develop self-conscious
and self-reliant regional economies. Kemmis argues forcefully
against government policies that segment urban and rural interests.
 Not only have these policies allowed suburban sprawl and interests
to spread unchecked, they have created the illusion that the economic
health of farmers and the economic health of urban centers can
be pursued independently:
<P>
<I>Throughout history, the role of cities has been precisely to
focus,  organize, and multiply the resources of the surrounding
regions to which they are organically connected. In the era of
the nation-state, we had not only lost sight of this role, but
what is worse, national policy has misled both cities and their
rural surroundings into believing that they could prosper independently
of one another, especially if each could open a wide enough pipeline
to Washington... One of the best ways for the Agriculture Department
to help its rural constituents would be to insist upon a rigorous
review of the long list of national policies that have exploded
the natural integrity of city-regions, deluding city centers,
suburbs, and rural surroundings into ignoring their mutual dependency.
(p.119-120)</I>
<P>
<B>Reviewer's Comments<BR>
</B>Kemmis is correct in suggesting that support for sustainable
agriculture and rural development requires more than aggressive
lobbying for increased  funding of these programs by the USDA.
Indeed, he raises a larger question: On whom will farmers and
rural residents choose to be dependent? In an age where federal
expenditures continue to shrink, and global corporations often
exploit communities to benefit stockholders, wouldn't the interests
of farmers and rural residents be better served by increasing
their links and ties to nearby cities?  From this perspective,
it appears that the work  of building a more sustainable agriculture
is inseparable from the work of building more self-reliant regional
economies suited to particular places.
<P>
As the concept of sustainable agriculture continues to evolve,
greater attention is being directed to linking urban and rural
interests and building tangible connections between those who
grow food and those who eat it. The principle of &quot;systems
thinking&quot; has expanded well beyond the farm  gate, giving
rise to a concern for the &quot;urban-rural interface.&quot; In
large measure this new emphasis grows from the quite tangible
economic stakes that farmers have in developing more beneficial
and direct marketing relationships with consumers. But in a larger
sense, the new concern speaks to a growing understanding that
without shared stewardship of our resources it will be impossible
to sustain either the agricultural economy or the quality of life
we wish for our cities.
<P>
The efforts of individuals to shape a political economy that allows
a city and its surrounding countryside to thrive and prosper can
be summed up in a too often neglected word.  That word is citizenship.
In fact, citizenship is the proper name and rightful home of systems
thinking applied to public problems. The hallmark of such thought
is the effort to attend to the particular needs of citizens without
losing  sight of the common good, and attend to the whole without
losing sight of the value of each particular citizen. It is perhaps
not too surprising that farmers devoted to whole systems approaches
on their farms are among the nation's most inspiring leaders in
sparking a renewed emphasis on citizenship, community building,
and civic literacy.

Lygus spp. and Orius tristicolor (minute pirate bug) are associated with the flowers<LI>
Used successfully in orchards and vineyards</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is frost tolerant and tolerates annual mean temperatures of from 5.7-23.7 degrees C ( mean of 59 cases 11.1) (Duke, 1981); the corresponding figures for narrowleaf trefoil are 7-16.9 (mean of 10 cases, 6.7) (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil will grow on poorly-drained, droughty, infertile, acid, or moderately alkaline soils, and is mildly salt tolerant (Duke, 1981).  It tolerates waterlogged soils (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Narrowleaf trefoil is native to wet meadows and sands, but tolerates dry soils that when flooded drain poorly; it does well on saline and alkaline soils (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is native throughout almost all of Europe and parts of Asia, including Iran and India; it ranges from the Boreal Moist to Wet through Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zone; and it has been introduced to many areas, including Australia, North America, and South America (Duke, 1981).  In California, it occurs occasionally in lawns and along roadsides (Munz, 1973). It is widely distributed, and most diverse in the Mediterranean region; it does not do well in the southeastern U.S., where it is prone to root diseases (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Narrowleaf trefoil is native througout most of Europe, except northeast and extreme south, and range extends through Crimea, Caucasus, and Central Asia; range comprises Cool Temperate Steppe to Wet through Warm Temperate Moist Forest Life Zone (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil does not do well in the Southeast, where it is prone to root diseases (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil tolerates soil pH of 4.5-8.2 (mean of 56 cases 6.4); the corresponding figures for narrowleaf trefoil are 5.6-8.0 (mean of 9 cases, 6.7); it is reported as doing well from pH 4.5-7.9, with best nodulation at pH 6.0-6.5 (Duke, 1981). Birdsfoot trefoil produces best on soil pH 6.2-6.5 or higher, and tolerates acid soils better than does alfalfa (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is a long-lived, slightly-decumbent perennial legume that can attain a height of 60-90 cm (Miller, 1984).  At maturity, plants have many highly-branched stems growing from a single crown; roots can produce new shoots (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Decumbent and intermediately-statured cultivars of birdsfoot trefoil show the best persistence in heavily-grazed pastures because regrowth is more rapid (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>The birdsfoot trefoil root system is not as deep as that of alfalfa and is more highly branched in the shallower (30-60 cm depth) soil strata (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Plants at maturity have many highly-branched stems growing from a single crown. Roots can produce new shoots (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Grant and Marten (1985), birdsfoot trefoil seed are small, 825,000-925,000 seed/kg, and range in color from olive green to brown, to almost black.  Seedcoats may be mottled.  A high proportion of birdsfoot trefoil seed is hard and, therefore, impermeable to water.  The proportion can be reduced from 0.90 to 0.40 by combine harvesting.  Scarification may be needed to ensure prompt stand development.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil flowers from June through September (Munz, 1973) or when days are long, from 16 to 18 hours in length (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name of birdsfoot trefoil is <I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B> L. (Duke, 1981; Miller,1984; Grant and Marten, 1985).  The scientific name of narrowleaf trefoil is <I>Lotus tenuis</I></B>.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil has at least 25 varieties, including 'Carroll,' 'Empire,' 'Leo,' 'Norcen,' and 'Viking' for use in Canada, and 'Fergus' for use in the South (e.g., northern Alabama). 'Vega II' was developed for increased seedling vigor, winter growth, and yield in California (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P> Narrowleaf trefoil (<I>Lotus tenuis</I></B>) has linear-lanceolate leaflets and small flowers that start yellow and turn orange-red with age. The root system is very shallow.  There is cross-compatibility with <I>L. corniculatus</I></B> suggesting that <I>Lotus tenuis</I></B> may be a progenitor species.  The latter form is abundant in California (Grant and Marten, 1985), and there is a cultivar called 'Los Banos' that has been grown widely within California (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil should be cut to a height of about 5-10 cm (2-4 inches); closer mowing would remove too many of the axillary buds needed for regrowth (Miller, 1984).  Decumbent and intermediately-statured cultivars of birdsfoot trefoil show the best persistence in heavily-grazed pastures because regrowth is more rapid (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Companion (nurse) crops of grasses can aid weed control and help reduce erosion during establishment of birdsfoot trefoil.  The early mowing of these grasses can be helpful in reducing competition (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is as nutritious to cattle as alfalfa or more so (Grant and Marten, 1985), and it does not cause bloating. (Miller,1984).  Decumbent and intermediately-statured cultivars of birdsfoot trefoil show the best persistence in heavily-grazed pastures because regrowth is more rapid (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Grasses are good complements to birdsfoot trefoil because they limit lodging by the legume and invasion by weeds (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Companion (nurse) crops of grasses can aid weed control and help reduce erosion during establishment of birdsfoot trefoil.  The early mowing of these grasses can be helpful to reduce competition (Grant and Marten, 1985).  If a companion grass is seeded along with birdsfoot trefoil, it should be a slow-growing grass, rather than a highly-competitive species like oat or ryegrass (Miller, 1984).<P> In Uruguay, Danso et al.  (1991) studied a triculture of birdsfoot trefoil, white clover and <I>Festuca arandinacea</I></B>. Approximately 130 kg N/ha was derived from fixation during the first year of the study.  Only in the first harvest did white clover exceed birdsfoot trefoil in herbage or total N content. Birdsfoot trefoil derived 91% of its N from the atmosphere, as compared with 88% for white clover.  White clover was subject to a depression of N fixation when N-fertilizer application was increased from 2 to 10 kg N/ha, but birdsfoot trefoil showed no such depression.  In the first year of the study, the two legumes contributed almost equally to the total 130 kg N/ha fixed, but in the last two harvests of the second year, birdsfoot trefoil contributed 95% of the 46 kg N/ha fixed.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Grasses are good complements to birdsfoot trefoil because they limit lodging by the legume and invasion by weeds (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Companion (nurse) crops of grasses seeded with the legume can aid weed control and help reduce erosion during the establishment phase.  The early mowing of these grasses can be helpful in reducing excessive competition (Grant and Marten, 1985). In plots seeded to birdsfoot trefoil in late October, 1990, weed above-ground biomass data (dry) was 2.372+/-0.928 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M. (about 48% of the weed biomass occurring in control plots) during mid-May, 1991 Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California. Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  In early May, vegetational cover by birdsfoot trefoil was 32.50+/-5.95 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is a long-lived, slightly-decumbent perennial legume that can develop new plants by producing roots at the internode or from axillary buds at the node (Miller, 1984). Birdsfoot trefoil flowers are clustered, with 4-8 per peduncle (Miller, 1984) and are bee pollinated (Grant and Marten, 1985). The species has a high level of self-incompatibility, and most seed result from outcrossing (Grant and Marten, 1985). Seeds ripen 25-30 days after pollination (Miller,1984; Grant and Marten, 1985).  Five to 6 pods develop per peduncle, each pod containing 10-15 seeds (Miller,1984).  Seed are scattered when the pods split and twist spirally (Grant and Marten, 1985). After each harvest, nodules on birdsfoot trefoil senesce, and new nodules form during regrowth (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil seed can be stored for 20 years (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>For Birdsfoot trefoil, smooth seedbeds are required; seed is small and seedling growth slow, so seed should preferably be buried 0.6 cm and certainly no deeper than 1.3 cm (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Birdsfoot trefoil % seedling emergence was 31, 18, 8, and 3 at respective seeding depths of 0.6, 1.3, 1.9, and 2.5 cm (0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 inch) (Miller,1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>For Birdsfoot trefoil, smooth seedbeds are required; seed is small and seedling growth slow, so seed should preferably be buried 0.6 cm and certainly no deeper than 1.3 cm (Grant and Marten, 1985).  This species can establish with spring or autumn seeding (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Seeding rate is from 5-12 kg/ha.  High rates of seeding are not essential to ensure long-term high yields (Grant and Marten, 1985).  A high proportion of seed is hard and, therefore, impermeable to water. The proportion can be reduced from 0.90 to 0.40 by combine harvesting.  Scarification may be needed to ensure prompt stand development (Grant and Marten, 1985). Cultipacking or rolling improves seed-to-soil contact and enhances establishment (Miller,1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil can establish with spring or autumn seeding (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil seeding rate is from 5-12 kg/ha.  High rates of seeding are not essential to ensure long-term high yields (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil benefits from addition of P (Grant and Marten, 1985) and sometimes K (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>A high proportion of birdsfoot trefoil seed is hard, that is, impermeable to water.  The proportion can be reduced from 0.90 to 0.40 by combine harvesting. Scarification may be needed to ensure prompt stand development (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Seed harvest should occur when 70-80% of pods have matured. As indicated by Duke (1981), mow the crop, windrow to dry, and combine. Alternatively, the mowed crop could be stored like hay and later threshed, but this usually results in unacceptable loss of seed (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Grant and Marten (1985) stated that narrowleaf trefoil (<I>Lotus tenuis</I></B>) has linear-lanceolate leaflets and small flowers that start yellow and turn orange-red with age.  The root system is very shallow.  There is cross-compatibility with <I>L. corniculatus</I></B> suggesting that <I>Lotus tenuis</I></B> may be a progenitor species. This form is abundant in California. Birdsfoot trefoil plants at maturity have many highly-branched stems growing from a single crown.  Roots can produce new shoots.<P> Miller (1984) mentioned that birdsfoot trefoil leaves are compound, with 5 leaflets; that 5-6 pods develop per peduncle, each pod containing 10-15 seeds; and that seed pods turn light brown or black when mature.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil can attain a height of 60-90 cm (Miller, 1984).  Mean height (+/- S.E.M.) of fall-seeded broadleaf birdsfoot trefoil was 19.05 +/- 2.43 in the following May (Mendocino County, California) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Seed ripen 25-30 days after pollination (Miller,1984; Grant and Marten, 1985).  Seed are scattered when the pods split and twist spirally (Grant and Marten, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil % seedling emergence was 31, 18, 8, and 3 at respective seeding depths of 0.6, 1.3, 1.9, and 2.5 cm (0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 inch) (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil flowers are bee pollinated; there is a high level of self-incompatibility, and most seed result from outcrossing (Grant and Marten, 1985).  5-6 pods develop per peduncle, each pod containing 10-15 seeds (Miller, 1984).  Seed ripen 25-30 days after pollination, at which time, seed pods turn light brown or black (Miller, 1984).  Seed are scattered when the pods split and twist spirally (Grant and Marten, 1985).  Seed harvest should occur when 70-80% of pods have matured (Duke, 1981). As indicated by Duke (1981), mow the crop, windrow to dry, and combine.  Alternatively, the mowed crop could be stored like hay and later threshed, but this usually results in unacceptable loss of seed (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Miller (1984), birdsfoot trefoil reseeds itself by pod shattering.  It should be cut to a height of about 5-10 cm (2-4 inches); closer mowing would remove too many of the axillary buds needed for regrowth (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Dry above-ground biomass of broadleaf birdsfoot trefoil was: 6.443+/-3.989 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  in mid-May, 1991 for cover crops seeded during October, 1990, at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California; biomass of the cover crop plus resident vegetation was 8.815+/-3.409 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B>) and narrowleaf trefoil (<I>Lotus tenuis</I></B>).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Seeds require scarification to ensure imbibition of water and germination. A firm seedbed is required; seedlings are not vigorous and compete poorly with nurse crops, weeds, and grasses (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil tolerates mean annual temperatures of 5.7-23.7 with the m,ean of 59 cases being 11.1 C, and tolerates frost (Duke, 1981).  Narrowleaf trefoil tolerates a mean annual temperature of 7.0-16.9 C, with a mean of 10 cases of 10.2 C.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>No specific information was found in the literature, but Bugg (pers. comm.) observed birdsfoot trefoil as a perennial cover crop in organic vineyards and pear orchards in Mendocino County, California.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>

<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot trefoil is widely available, but narrowleaf trefoil has been impossible to find during the last 5 years.  The latter is difficult to harvest because the pods often shatter (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Birdsfoot and narrowleaf trefoils are perennials and are typically managed no-till.<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Mowers of various types may be used with birdsfoot and narrowleaf trefoils (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>The following was taken from Duke (1981).  Birdsfoot trefoil is used as an excellent non-bloating forage, and is good as pasture, hay, or silage for horses and cattle.  It is especially good on infertile, poorly-drained soils, and those that are difficult to cultivate.  It is a drought resistant ground cover. Duke (1981) mentioned that narrowleaf trefoil is suitable for pasture or hay production on dry but poorly-drained soils.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that birdsfoot trefoil hay contains 13.4-28.8% crude protein, and the green forage 14.8-29.1%.  Based on the assumption that 6.25% of protein is N, these figures translate to 0.8775-1.7625% and 0.925-1.81875% of the dry biomass being N.  No yield data were presented by Duke (1981). Miller (1984) wrote that annual hay production ranged from 4-10 Mg/ha. These figures combined with the above-listed values for green forage suggest annual production of 37-181.88 kg N/ha. Gershuny and Smillie (1986) wrote that birdsfoot trefoil ploughed under yields over 100 lb N/a.<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that the hay of birdsfoot trefoil contained on a moisture-free basis 0.16-0.49% P, 1.47-1.97 % K, 0.31-0.78% Mg, 0.013-0.015% Fe, 0.6% Mn, and 1.04-1.92% Ca.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on the effects on water of birdsfoot trefoil.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on the effects on microclimate by birdsfoot trefoil.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on the effects on soil of birdsfoot trefoil.  The taproot is not so deep as those of alfalfa or sweetclover (Miller, 1984), so birdsfoot trefoil is unlikely to affect soil at depth as those species can (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on effects by birdsfoot trefoil on workers. The low stature of the plant should enable easy access to orchard or vineyard workers (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Minute pirate bug (<I>Orius tristicolor</I></B>), a generalist predator of various agricultural pests, may be abundant in the inflorescences of birdsfoot trefoil (Bugg, pers. comm.). Duke (1981) listed the following phytophagous arthropods as being associated with birdsfoot and narrowleaf trefoils: meadow spittlebug (<I>Philaenus spumarius</I></B>), alfalfa plant bug (<I>Adelphocoris lineolatus</I></B>), potato leafhopper (<I>Empoasca fabae</I></B>), clover seed chalcid (<I>Bruchophagus platypterus</I></B>), and white grub (<I>Phyllophaga hirticula</I></B>).  The latter damages the roots. Duke (1981) mentioned that trefoils are mostly self-incompatible and require insects (mainly Hymenoptera) for pollination.<P> Duke (1981)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>

Phytopathology 83:581-589. 1993 <BR>

<P>
Previous studies comparing different organic and conventional
farming systems have shown that soil organic matter and polysaccharide
content, microbial biomass, soil bulk density, soil erosion, and
available water are higher in organic or ecologically-managed
systems than in conventional farming systems (Doran et al., 1987;
Lockeretz et al., 1981; Reganold et al., 1987). The purpose of
this comparative study was to see if the same conclusions could
be drawn for a California cropping system. Specifically, this
study was conducted to determine the effects of different management
practices on soil physical, chemical and biological properties
and to relate these effects to disease severity in tomatoes. Agronomic
differences were reported in a previous publication (Shennan et
al., 1991); this paper focuses on two important tomato diseases
in California. corky root and Phytophthora root rot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Methods Summary</H3>

<P>
Twenty sampling locations were randomly selected at each of nine
farms in 1989 and 18 farms in 1990. Of the nine farms selected
in 1989, two were organic, three were transitional and four were
conventional. The 18 farms sampled in 1990 were evenly split,
nine organic and nine conventional. Two to three days after irrigation
at the green fruit stage, 810 soil cores were taken at each sampling
location. These cores were used to determine ten soil variables:
water-stable aggregates, percent clay, organic carbon content,
nitrate and ammonium, soil pH and electrical conductivity, total
nitrogen content, nitrogen mineralization potential, and fluorescein
diacetate hydrolytic activity. Two to three weeks after these
soil samples were collected, researchers returned to the same
sampling sites to collect data on plant biomass and tissue nitrogen
content, and the incidence and severity of Phytophthora root rot
and corky root. <BR>

<P>
The use of simple statistical techniques such as analysis of variance
would have required the selection of paired organic and conventional
farms. This selection was not possible. Therefore, multivariate
statistics were used to relate the different measurements to each
other for each individual sample. Samples could not be combined
per field, because roughly ten times as many observations as variables
are required for multivariate analyses. Three types of discriminant
analyses were performed on the data: discriminant function, canonical
discriminant, and stepwise discriminant analyses. These analyses
are described in detail in the original paper <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Disease Incidence</H3>

<P>
The disease organism <I>Phytophthora parasatica</I> was detected
by leaf bait assay in soil samples from five of the nine conventional
farms; disease symptoms were observed on three of these farms.
Phytophthora was not found on any of the organic farms. Corky
root. on the other hand, was found on most plants in most locations,
but the incidence and severity of the disease were higher on conventional
farms than on organic farms (table 1). <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Influence of Soil Variables</H3>

<P>
Corky root-severity values, estimated populations of <I>P. parasitica</I>,
and Phytophthora root rot-severity values were grouped into classes
for use in stepwise and canonical discriminant analyses with the
ten soil variables and plant tissue nitrogen. These analyses &quot;indicated
that corky root severity was positively associated with nitrogen
in tomato tissue and nitrate concentrations in soil, which were
higher in conventional farms than in organic farms....In addition
to the positive association of corky root of tomato with inorganic
nitrogen concentrations in soil and plant tissue, there was a
negative association between this disease and microbial activity
in soil (as expressed by FDA hydrolytic activity and nitrogen-mineralization
potential).&quot; Microbial activity (FDA hydrolytic activity
and nitrogen mineralization potential) in both years was higher
in the organic farms where compost and green manure had been incorporated
prior to planting. <BR>

<P>
In contrast to corky root, the severity of Phytophthora root rot
and the presence of <I>P. parasitica</I> in the soil were associated
with variables other than nitrogen. Clay content, soil water content,
organic carbon, and water-stable aggregates were the major factors
that distinguished between the presence and absence of the disease
organism in the soil. <BR>

<P>
In summary, corky root severity was primarily affected by biological
factors and tissue nitrogen, while Phytophthora root rot was affected
mainly by factors related to soil texture, structure, and chemistry.
This conclusion is supported by consistent results over two years
of study. <BR>

<P>
The authors caution that other factors may have affected the development
of the two diseases. Preliminary results from greenhouse tests
in which the corky root pathogen was added to various soils showed
that corky root was suppressed in organically-managed soils. Nonetheless,
lower corky root severities on organic farms may have been partially
the result of lower levels of disease inoculum. In the case of
Phytophthora root rot, the disease organism may not have been
introduced in some of the organic fields, or different methods
of irrigation on the organic farms could have controlled the disease.
&quot;Results obtained in this study cannot be considered conclusive
but have led to hypotheses about the mechanisms that suppress
corky root and Phytophthora root rot in organic relative to conventional
farms. Additional greenhouse experiments will be needed to test
these hypotheses.&quot; <BR>
