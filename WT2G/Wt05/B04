<H1>National survey of attitudes towards agricultural natural

</H1>

<P>
Natural Resources Conservation Service. 1995
<P>
This survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,250 persons
was conducted via telephone interviews during December 1994 and
January 1995. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the public
perception of environmental issues such as pollution, food safety
and water supply as well as to determine the level of recognition
of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), now called the Natural
Resources Conservation Service. The survey was conducted by The
Gallup Organization.
<P>
According to the results of this survey, issues of water quality
and supply and air pollution were the foremost concerns for respondents
when considering natural resource issues and problems in their
own state and community. Community concerns also included landfill
and toxic waste disposal issues, while statewide concerns included
forestry, pesticide and other chemical use, and soil quality.
It was interesting to note that respondents generally regarded
the environmental condition of the entire world and the U.S. to
be worse than that of their own community. In rating the environmental
condition on a scale of 1 to 10, where &quot;10&quot; was &quot;excellent&quot;
and &quot;1&quot; was &quot;very polluted,&quot; the most frequent
rating for the world and the U.S. was &quot;5.&quot; The most
frequent rating for participants' own communities was &quot;7.&quot;
Almost a quarter of respondents reported that there were no natural
resource problems in their own community.
<P>
Participants were also asked to consider the level of environmental
caretaking by different industries and groups. These groups were
rated on a scale of 1 to 10 with &quot;1&quot; meaning &quot;serious
polluter&quot; and &quot;10&quot; meaning &quot;excellent caretaker
of the environment.&quot; Of the ten groups named by the interviewer,
&quot;agriculture in general&quot; and &quot;individual farmers&quot;
were rated the highest. &quot;Individual farmers&quot; had an
average rating of 6.7; &quot;agriculture in general&quot; averaged
6.3. However, &quot;large corporate farms run by companies&quot;
were rated 5.4-similar to the mean rating scores of other industries
such as construction, lawn services, timber, and high-tech industries.
<P>
Survey participants did, however, register concern regarding the
impact of agriculture on the environment. Approximately half of
the respondents disagreed with statements that suggested that
current levels of agricultural pesticides and fertilizers in our
food and water supply are safe. While a quarter of respondents
agreed with these statements, the last quarter were undecided.
<P>
Some government regulation of agricultural natural resources seems
to be acceptable and expected by most respondents. When questioned
on the appropriateness of different strategies that the federal
government might use to handle natural resource problems, options
such as voluntary incentive programs, withholding benefits, and
imposing penalties were all seen as appropriate by at least half
of the respondents. The only option deemed inappropriate by over
half the respondents was the reduction or elimination of government
involvement in agriculture such that &quot;whatever happened would
be allowed to happen.&quot;
<P>
Further acceptance of environmental protection by the government
could be seen in the responses to questions regarding laws protecting
threatened and endangered species and agricultural wetlands. About
40 percent of respondents felt that protection for both endangered
species and wetlands did not go far enough, while 38 percent felt
these protection laws were about right. About 15 percent thought
wetlands protection went too far, and 24 percent thought endangered
species laws went too far. Clearly, a majority of this sample
did not feel that these environmental protections are too stringent.
Even when faced with the issue of federal spending on resource
conservation, over half of the respondents wanted to increase
the spending (either a little or a lot); only 16 percent wanted
to decrease spending.
<P>
In many of the survey responses, it was evident that the older
respondents were less likely to regard environmental problems
as seriously as the younger respondents. It is therefore not surprising
that the younger respondents were more supportive of increased
spending on conservation and were more likely to expect more government
regulation of natural resources in the future.
<P>
This survey found that half of all respondents had heard of what
was then called SCS. However, 80 percent of the farmers and ranchers
surveyed were familiar with SCS. Although only 3 percent (43 persons)
of the survey participants had received services from SCS, the
 majority of them were satisfied with the services they had received.

<H1>Crop Rotations: What do <I>You </I>Use?<BR>
</H1>
<P>
Crop rotations are often recognized as an important means of pest
control or of improving soil quality in annual cropping systems.
Lack of research on this topic, however, has resulted in very
sparse information on crop rotations for California farmers. 
Growers' decisions regarding rotations are largely based on their
own knowledge and experience about what works for them rather
than on scientifically-based research information. UC SAREP is
initiating a project to organize some of this experience-based
and scientifically-based information into a database of particular
crop sequences. A synthesis of old and new information on crop
rotations will be of assistance to growers interested in making
the transition to production systems less dependent on off-farm
purchase of petrochemical inputs.<BR>
<P>
Drawing from your own expertise and experience, do you have information
on crop rotations? If you know of <I>specific </I>advantages or
disadvantages of various crop sequences we would like to hear
from you. Contact <B>Dave Chaney</B> by telephone (916/752-8667)
or mail (UC SAREP, University of California, Davis, CA 95616)
with your ideas and suggestions. <BR>

UC SAREP is producing a booklet designed to help California growers
incorporate sustainable agriculture practices into their farming
operations. The booklet will include information on making the
transition to farming systems with long-term viability, and will
include bibliographic references on increasing soil fertility,
the efficient use of energy and other inputs, and other farming
practices.
<P>
SAREP staff members will be conducting interviews with California
growers in all stages of transition. UC farm advisors are being
contacted to suggest names of individuals who may wish to participate.

<H1>Organic Symposium</H1>
<P>
Organic agriculture proponents will help bridge the information
gap with conventional agriculture and academia at &quot;Organic
Farming Symposium&quot; scheduled January 22-23, 1992 at the Asilomar
Conference Center in Pacific Grove.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The critical issue is that the symposium will provide a
forum for exchange of the best available information on organic
farming theory and practice, including academic research and practical
farming experience,&quot; said <B>David Visher</B> of the UC Small
Farm Center, one of the event's sponsors.  The symposium is also
sponsored by the Committee for Sustainable Agriculture, a private
non-profit group which sponsors the Ecological Farming Conference
scheduled immediately after.<BR>
<P>
Symposium organizers hope to connect the science and practice
of organic farming, according to Visher.  He said many in the
academic community question the science behind organic farming.
 The conference will feature current research on crop rotation,
cover crops, soil fertility, organic soil management, beneficial
insects, pests, crop selection, minimum tillage, organic livestock
production and organic certification.  It will also include discussions
of the definitions of sustainable, transition and low-input agriculture,
and state and federal organic laws.<BR>
<P>
Organizers are expecting the published symposium proceedings to
be an important product of the event.  The symposium is aimed
at farmers, researchers, educators, Extension staff, agricultural
commissioners, soil conservationists, pest control advisers, and
others in related agricultural fields.<BR>
<P>
For more information contact the Davis-based UC Small Farm Center
(916) 757-8742.<BR>

<H1>Free Ag Hotline<BR>
</H1>
<P>
SAREP's <B>Jill Auburn</B> participated in a September 1989 two-day
review of Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural America (ATTRA),
a toll-free hotline (800-346-9140) sponsored by the USDA Extension
Service and operated by the National Center for Appropriate Technology.
 Ten reviewers from throughout the U.S. worked to clarify ATTRA's
role as it relates to local Cooperative Extension.  ATTRA specialists
answer telephone inquiries from individuals throughout the country
and respond with individually tailored letters, plus related articles
and contacts for further information. Unlike Cooperative Extension,
ATTRA does not give immediate recommendations for solving a particular
problem.<BR>
<P>
ATTRA is a resource for specialists, farm advisors and farmers,
who want more background on a topic. The review group agreed that
extension personnel should be encouraged to call ATTRA if they
are looking for information in sustainable agriculture. Reviewers
offered to be conduits through which ATTRA could periodically
update Cooperative Extension personnel on the kinds of questions
received from each state, and the information provided by ATTRA
in response.<BR>

California Policy Seminar, University of California, Berkeley,
CA. 1993<BR>

<P>
This report was researched and written by the Center for Occupational
and Environmental Health at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.
It is the first part of a project designed to assess the environmental
health impacts associated with pesticide use in California. This
report focuses on pesticide-related illnesses for agricultural
workers. Future reports will focus on how pesticides affect community
health and California's ecosystem. The goal of this project is
to identify high-risk pesticides and pesticide use patterns. Information
that ranks various pesticides on the basis of their impacts on
worker health, community health and the ecosystem can then help
inform policies that develop improved risk management and prevention
strategies, including the development of nontoxic alternatives.
<BR>

<P>
Pesticides pose significant health risks to the people who harvest
our food. Although California leads the nation in its regulatory
program to protect agricultural workers, effective use of these
controls has been severely limited. Each year, the application
of over 160 million pounds of pesticides in California has led
to approximately 1,000 cases of acute occupational illnesses and
contributed to chronic health concerns such as cancer, adverse
reproductive outcomes, respiratory and neurological diseases.
Farmworkers frequently lack the training to understand the risks
they face or to act effectively in the political sphere to affect
changes in the system. The farm economy perpetuates worker risks
through its seasonal nature, its reliance on farm labor contractors
and the fact that it is now exempt from much of the social legislation
that protects worker' interests in other employment sectors. 
<BR>

<P>
Recognizing the ineffectiveness of the traditional regulatory
approach, this report suggests that a fundamentally new strategy
is needed with three basic components:<B> a new risk assessment</B>
approach that will identify the most hazardous pesticides using
available data on farmworker risks, community health risks and
risks to the ecosystem; <B>a</B> <B>new risk management approach</B>
that focuses attention on high priority problems and enforces
controls; and most importantly, <B>a</B> <B>new risk prevention
approach</B> that promotes the reduction of chemical use and substitutes
less toxic alternatives. The report suggests that new pesticide
policy must make a paradigm shift &quot;from 'safe use' to a socially
and environmentally 'sustainable' agriculture.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Risk Assessment: Setting Health-Based Priorities</H3>

<P>
As a first step to setting priorities for intervention, the report
brings together data on volume use, worker poisonings, and acute
and chronic toxicity for 70 high-profile pesticides in California.
For each pesticide, the report provides a ranking based on several
risk attributes including: worker poisonings, acute toxicity,
chronic toxicity and cancer potency. One clear result from this
analysis is that, for some pesticides, the rankings are not consistent
among the various categories; pesticides listed as 'high-risk
under one attribute, are low on the list for another attribute.
The ranking also reveals that acute toxicity, a common measure
of health risk, is not always the best predictor of high human
illness burdens. Finally, volume of use was not highly correlated
with toxicity or illness measures.<BR>

<P>
Based on the deficiencies apparent in single attribute rankings,
the report goes on to organize available illness data by principal
crops and by occupational activities associated with exposures.
This helps focus regulatory attention on the most important problems.
For example, the report examines data on six California agricultural
commodities that ranked high in reported illnesses between 1984-90:
grapes, oranges, cotton, almonds, lettuce and tomatoes. Each crop
had a different pattern of pesticide use and illnesses. The analyses
helped point to problems in regulatory controls. The report shows
that workers in <I>every</I> job category can be exposed to daily
doses of pesticides that significantly exceed levels determined
to be safe. <BR>

<P>
Recent legislation has generally selected only a few attributes
as the priority-setting mechanisms for targeting pesticide use
reduction; for example, based on percentage of pounds applied,
on laboratory measures of acute toxicity, on food residue levels
or on cancer risks. This report suggests that each of these approaches
<I>alone</I> suffer from limitations; but together, they provide
a reasonable assessment of a range of pesticide-related health
problems and can be used to establish a more informed pesticide
policy. <BR>

<P>
Risk Management: Reforming the Regulatory Framework
<P>
The report reviews the state and federal government's efforts
to control farmworker exposure to toxic chemicals through four
major strategies: pesticide use controls, safe work practices,
worker education and training, and compensation. Although each
offers some benefits, they also suffer from limitations. Safe
work practices, for example, are &quot;woefully under enforced&quot;;
worker education and training programs have only been modestly
beneficial. The compensation system has also been difficult to
implement. Farmworkers who are transient, undocumented and do
not speak English, are reluctant to file for compensation. Further,
their chances of overcoming a legal defense by the agricultural
or insurance industries are very small. This shows up in the statistics:
&quot;In agriculture, on-the-job death benefits average $600 per
worker, while accidental deaths in all other industries average
over $39,000. For workers in agriculture, the average compensation
for accidental injuries is less than $6, while workers in other
industries receive over $230.&quot; <BR>

<P>
The report encourages several efforts to reform the regulatory
system including: 1) the acceleration of the state and federal
registration process to bring the most hazardous pesticides under
certification and labeling requirements; 2) the wider application
of reentry intervals, hazard communication and mandatory training
to cover all major sources of farmworker illnesses; and 3) targeted
and strengthened enforcement of pesticide-related and other worker
protections. <BR>

<H3>Risk Prevention: Transition to a Sustainable Agriculture</H3>

<P>
According to the report, prevention of hazardous exposures by
eliminating use of a toxic pesticide has never been a major goal
for the regulatory system. There has been more focus on risk mitigation
than on risk prevention. The traditional risk assessment and risk
management system, along with farmers, are caught in the pesticide
treadmill. The only solution to getting off of this treadmill
is to move towards a completely new paradigm that emphasizes the
reduction of pesticide use and the substitution of less toxic
alternatives. For public policy makers and regulatory agencies,
this requires developing broad incentives that simultaneously
discourage the use of toxic pesticides and encourage the use of
alternative farming practices. The report suggests that the foundation
of this approach would be a steep sales tax on pesticides adjusted
according to the risks posed by particular pesticides. Revenues
from the proposed tax would fund a range of socially desirable
activities including farmworker protections and research into
nontoxic production practices. Currently, &quot;research on the
institutional and social constraints limiting the adoption and
diffusion of alternative methods is particularly underfunded.&quot;
Funds from a risk-based pesticide fee could not only support university
based research efforts on alternative agricultural practices,
but could help finance positive incentives to farmers to switch
to alternative methods, i.e. provide crop insurance, develop marketing
programs and facilitate the distribution of information through
the Extension Service and other organizations. Finally, resources
should be devoted to ensuring that occupational health and safety
of agricultural workers is taken into account during the development
of alternative pest control methods. <BR>

<H1>Potential of adult carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) as predators
of fifth-instar codling moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in apple
orchards in California.</H1>

<P>
<I>E. W Riddick and N.J. MiII5</I>
<P>
Environmental Entomology 23:1338-1345. 1994
<P>
Codling moth is a serious pest of several crops including apples,
pears and walnuts.  In semidwarf apple orchards, the smooth bark
of the trees affords few pupation sites so codling moth typically
pupates on the ground in leaf litter, or in the soil.  This habit
renders the larvae susceptible to predation by ground-dwelling
predators, including carabid beetles.  In apple orchards in Sonoma
and Contra Costa counties of California, the investigators conducted
observations on predators attacking fifth-instar codling moth
tethered on the orchard floor.  Tethering was by means of heavy-duty
black cotton thread fastened either to a 9-cm disk of sandpaper
or to an inverted petri dish of 9.5-cm diameter that was flush
with the soil.  Laboratory studies were also conducted on killing
success, degree of carnivory, and consumption patterns.
<P>
Carabidae attacking tethered codling moth larvae in the field
included <I>Agonum punctiforme Say, Calathus ruflcollis </I>Dejean,
<I>Harpalus pensylvanicus </I>DeGeer, and <I>Pterostichus (Hypherpes)
</I>spp.  In the <B>field, </B>predation rates were high during
early June, but declined during later June and July.  In the laboratory,
75 percent of the individuals tested of each of the following
species were capable of killing fifth-instar codling moth: <I>Pterostichus
lustrans LeConte, Pterostichus cursitor LeConte, Pterostichus
(Hypherpes) spp., Harpalus pensylvanicus </I>DeGeer, and <I>Anisodactylis
californicus Dejean. Pterostichus </I>spp. were particularly effective
predators.
<H3>Reviewer's Note</H3>

<P>
This article explores the role of carabids in apple orchards,
but ground beetles may also be active predators in walnut orchards.
 In walnuts, codling moth larvae overwinter under loose scales
of bark or in trash on the ground near the trunk.  Samples collected
by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> and John Dunley during July 1994 from organic walnut
orchards near Winters, California, were sent to Riddick for identification.
 Table 1 shows the carabid species found in that sampling (Orchard
1).  A collection made in late August at the edge of another organic
walnut orchard near Winters yielded 22 specimens.  These are also
listed in table 1 (Orchard 2).
<P>
In addition to the paper reviewed here, other studies in both
Europe and the U.S. are exploring the potential importance of
ground beetles (Carabidae) as biological control agents.  Several
recent papers have looked at the ability of ground beetles to
control pests (codling moth and others) that pupate in the soil;
other papers suggest possibilities for increasing their abundance
in agronomic crops.

Field mustard a frequent volunteer in North Coast vineyards: early maturation renders reseeding compatible with mid-March plowdown.</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Mustards are stemmy and produce dense, heavy growth (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Mustards do well in loam to heavy soils (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>In California, mustard should be seeded from October to November (Madson, 1951).<P> Kloen and Altieri (1990) conducted a trial at Albany, CA, comparing broccoli in monocultural plots to three schemes of intercropping broccoli with mustard (three planting dates for mustard: simultaneous with the broccoli and 2 and 3 weeks after). There was no significant effect of cropping scheme on densities of aphids on broccoli, nor for aphidophagous syrphid (hover fly) larvae, but the ratios of syrphid larvae to aphids were significantly higher for broccoli with mustard sown one week later. This may have been due to attraction of adult syrphids by the flowering mustard.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Most brassicas can tolerate minor freezes (Horn, 1985); mustards show moderate resistance to cold (Madson, 1951) and are not winter hardy in New England (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Several species of mustard are available and usable.  The most common is a form of black mustard, <I>Brassica nigra</I></B>, known locally as Trieste.  A brown-seed species, <I>Brassica juncea</I></B>, is also used.  Most of the mustards available, however, are a mixture of types and species.  Unfortunately, there has been no systematic evaluation of the relative merits of the various types and species (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Mustards are often used as cover crops in orchards (Madson, 1951).  The mustards are not used in general farming or in rotation with annual crops because most types produce some hard seed which will remain dormant in the soil and can cause weed problems in following crops (Madson, 1951).<P> Mustards winter kill in the northeastern United States making desirable mulch to accomodate spring-sown vegetables (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>N fertilizer is often applied when seeding an orchard cover crop of mustard to stimulate mustard growth and compensate for any competition that otherwise might affect orchard trees.  The N taken up by the cover crop will become available to the trees as the organic matter decays (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Most, if not all species, produce some hard seed (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>In a trial in southern Georgia that concerned 20 cover-cropping regimes and associated insects, convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) first were found in substantial numbers on rye (early February), then on crimson clover and lentil (mid February through late March), later on subterranean clover (early through late March), still later on narrow-leafed lupin (late March through early June), then hairy vetch (late March through early June), and lastly on mustard (mid April through late May) (which harbored turnip aphid [<I>Hyadaphis erysimi</I></B> {Kaltenbach}], cabbage aphid [<I>Brevicoryne brassicae</I></B> {L}], and, upon flowering, various thrips (<I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp., Thysanoptera: Thripidae), and collard (late April through early June) (Bugg et al., 1990).<P> As reported by Flexner et al.  (1990), in southern Oregonian pear orchards, certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems. Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, black mustard appeared least favorable to outbreaks of the mite.<P> Kloen and Altieri (1990) conducted a trial at Albany, CA, comparing broccoli in monocultural plots to three schemes of intercropping broccoli with mustard (three planting dates for mustard: simultaneous with the broccoli and 2 and 3 weeks after). There was no significant effect of cropping scheme on densities of aphids on broccoli, nor for syrphid larvae, but the ratios of syrphid larvae to aphids were significantly higher for broccoli with mustard sown one week later.  This may have been due to attraction of adult syrphids by the flowering mustard.<P> Mustard is not recommended as a cover crop in apple orchards where orange tortrix (<I>Argyrotaenia citrana</I></B> (Fernald); also known as apple skinworm) can be a problem because the pest overwinters on the mustard (Pickel, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Mustard incorporated as a green manure failed to significantly increase infiltration of irrigation water, although barley, cereal rye, annual ryegrass, and 'Blando' brome did so (Williams, 1966).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>White mustard (<I>Sinapis alba</I></B>) is susceptible to clubroot disease (Pears et al., 1989).  By contrast, Muehlchen et al. (1990) found that fall-planted white mustard reduced root rot severity and increased yield in pea after two successive rotational cycles. However, there was also some evidence that white mustard can reduce emergence of pea seedlings and nodulation of pea by rhizobial bacteria.  The presumed mechanism for suppression of pathogens is that after plough-down, sulfur-containing compounds are produced by the breakdown of glucosinolates in crucifer tissues; these may act as a soil fumigant which causes death of fungal propagules.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD><I>Sinapis alba</I></B> (white mustard) is one of the fastest growing green manures (Pears et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Mustards should be seeded at a depth of 0.4-0.8" (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Mustards flower from 3-5 weeks after sowing (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Mustard taproots extend to depths of 1-3 ft (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Mustards make no net contribution of nitrogen but can be used as catch crops to retain nitrogen already in the soil (Brinton, 1989). When mustards are used as catch crops, it is important to note that their residues break down more rapidly than do those of most grasses; thus, associated N may be liberated more rapidly (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Muehlchen, Rand, and Parke (1990) found that fall-planted white mustard (<I>Brassica hirta</I></B>) reduced root rot severity and increased yield in pea after two successive rotational cycles. However, there was also some evidence that white mustard can reduce emergence of pea seedlings and nodulation of pea by rhizobial bacteria.  The presumed mechanism for suppression of pathogens is that, after plough-down, sulfur-containing compounds are produced by the breakdown of glucosinolates in crucifer tissues; these may act as a soil fumigant which causes death of fungal propagules.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates for mustard have been suggested as 5-7 lbs/acre for small-seeded cultivars (Miller et al., 1989), 10-12 lbs/acre for large-seeded cultivars (Miller et al., 1989.), and generally as 20 lb/a (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Liebman and Robichaux (1990) found that a long-vined variety of field pea ('Century') was better than a short-vined variety ('Alaska') at suppressing mustard growth by shading.  'Century' also showed a greater yield.<P> Liebman and Robichaux (1990) found that intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B.  hirta</I></B>) than was a densely-seeded monoculture of barley. The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley).<P> Bialy et al.  (1990) found that black mustard and brown mustard show the most active allelopathic inhibition of other plants. Compounds involved probably include various isothiocyanates (ITC), which suppressed wheat germination and growth. 2-phenethyl ITC and Allyl ITC showed particularly high activity.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>In studies at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991, weed above-ground biomass data in plots seeded to black mustard was 1.015+/-0.437 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.).  This was 20.6% of the weed biomass in control plots.  In early May, vegetational cover by black mustard was 91.25+/-5.54 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> A long-vined variety of field pea ('Century') was better than a short-vined variety ('Alaska') at suppressing mustard growth by shading.  'Century' also showed a greater yield (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).<P> Liebman and Robichaux (1990) also found that intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B.  hirta</I></B>) than was a densely-seeded monoculture of barley.  The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley).<P> Black mustard and brown mustard allelopathically inhibit other plants. Compounds involved probably include various isothiocyanates (ITC), which suppressed wheat germination and growth.  2-phenethyl ITC and Allyl ITC showed particularly high activity (Bialy et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Black mustard attained a height of 171.45+/-11.00 (cm, Mean +/- S.E.M.) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991 (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Munz (1973) listed heights as field mustard: 3-12 dm; black mustard: 5-25 dm; brown mustard: 3-12 dm; and white mustard: 3-7 dm.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Black mustard yielded a mean above-ground biomass of 11.922+/-1.381 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991 (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Mustards used as cover crops include several members of the genus <I>Brassica</I></B>, including brown mustard (<I>Brassica juncea</I></B> [L.] Coss.), black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B> [L.] Koch), field mustard <I>Brassica campestris</I></B> L., and white mustard (<I>Brassica hirta</I></B> Moench) (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>Mustards include several members of the genus <I>Brassica</I></B>, including brown mustard (<I>Brassica juncea</I></B> [L.] Coss.), black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B> [L.] Koch), field mustard <I>Brassica campestris</I></B> L., and white mustard (<I>Brassica hirta</I></B> Moench) (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>According to Fischer et al. (1978), black mustard seedlings have cotyledons broad, kidney shaped, with a deep notch at the tip or apex.  The first true leaves are bright green on the upper surfaces and pale beneath.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>The following are based on accounts of Munz (1973):<P> Brown mustard (<I>Brassica juncea</I></B> [L.] Coss.) is a pale subglabrous annual, 3-12 dm high; lower leaves runcinate-pinnatifid and crenate, petioles 3-12 cm long, the upper nearly sessile, lanceolate or linear, entire or dentate; pedicels slender, divergent, 8-12 mm long; sepals 4-5 mm long; petals yellow, spatulate, 7-8 mm long; siliques 3-4 cm long, ascending, the beak 5-8 mm long seeds subglobose, ca, 1.5 mm in diamter, red-brown to yellowish, weakly reticulate.<P> Black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B> [L.] Koch) is an erect anual, branched above, 5-25 dm high, sparsely pubescent or subglabrous; lower leaves 1-2 dm long, deeply pinnatifid, with large terminal lobe and few small lateral ones; cauline leaves gradually reduced but not clasping, the uppermost pendulous; sepals 3.5-4.5 mm long; petals bright yellowm 7-8 mm long; pedicels 2-3 mm long, erect; siliques appressed, 1-2 cm long, the beak subulate, empty, 1-3 mm long; seeds ca 1-1.3 mm thick, dark red brown, finely reticulate.<P> Field mutsard (<I>B. campestris</I></B> is an erect annual, 3-12 dm tall, with slender roots, glaucous and quite glabrous except for the scattered hairs on the lower leaves; these petioled, +/- pinnatifid or lobed, 1-2 dm long; upper leaves, sessile, auriculate-clasping, lance-oblong, subentire, glabrous; pedicels spreading, 1-2 cm. long; sepals narrow-oblong,yellowish, 4-5 mm long; petals yellow, spatulate, 6-8 mm long; siliques not torulose,terete, 2-5 cm long, stout with a stout beak an additional 1-1.5 cm long; seeds 1.5-2 mm thick, dark reticulate; n=10 (Karpechenko, 1924).  Common weed, especially in orchards and waste places, widely distributed in Calif.; natur. from Eu.  Jan.-May also in other months.  (<I>B. Rapa L.</I></B> the Turnip, very like this, but with thickened roots, sometimes referred to the same sp.)<P> White mustard (<I>Brassica hirta</I></B> Moench) is an annual 3-7 dm high, more or less hirsute; lower leaves board, lyrately pinnate or pinnatifid, 10-20 cm long, petioled, the terminal lobe or leaflet large; upper leaves short-petioled, lanceolate or oblong; pedicels spreading in fr., 5-15 mm long; sepals 5-6 mm long; petals yellow, 8-11 mm long, 4-5 mm wide; siliques white-bristly, 2-3 cm long (including beak), the valves prominently 3-nerved, few-seeded, the beak flattened, broad, ca as long as the rest of the silique; seeds pale yellow, subglobose, 1-2 mm thick, minutely alveolate.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>The following account is paraphrased from that of Munz (1973). The genus <I>Brassica</I></B> is derived from Europe, Asia, and North Africa.  In California, black mustard is common on dry grassy slopes, in grain fields, and in waste places through much of the state.  Brown mustard is scattered through the state in grain fields and waste places.  Field mustard is widely distributed in California in orchards and waste places.  White mustard is cultivated as a green and is naturalized in widely scattered locales.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Williams (1966) found that various grasses grown as green manures improved infiltration of irrigation water on a deep, well-drained Yolo loam soil, but that black mustard did not.<P>

<DD>Days to flowering (following germination) are as follows 'Paragosa': 110; 'Paraponto': 100; 'Sapo': 106 (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> According to Mackay and Barnard (1981), 'Paragosa' flowers occurs earlier than 'Hannaford' barrel medic or snail medic (<I>M. scutellata</I></B>).  'Paraponto' flowers two weeks earlier than cv. `Paragosa'; 'Sapo' flowers about 1-4 days later than 'Paragosa' and continues up to 5 days later.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>'Paragosa,' 'Paraponto,' 'Sapo' (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>'Paragosa' requires a growing season of at least 5 months, 'Paraponto,' at least a 4 1/2 months; for 'Sapo,' the last pods mature about 7 days later than 'Paragosa' and 9 days later than 'Paraponto' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>'Paragosa' can set large amounts of seed, and there is usually enough hard seed to enable regeneration after one year cropping or a seasonal failure to set seed (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Minimal mean rainfall requirements are as follows: 'Paragosa': 350 mm;'Paraponto': 300 mm; 'Sapo': 350 mm (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>'Paragosa' produces biomass best on heavy alkaline soils (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Sapo' has similar soil requirements to `Paragosa' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>'Paragosa' appears as palatable to livestock as 'Hannaford' barrel medic or snail medic.  Coumestrol content is low (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Paraponto' pods are completely spineless, and this cultivar is relished by sheep and susceptible to overgrazing (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Gama medic is more exacting in its rhizobial requirements than barrel and strand medics, according to Mackay and Barnard (1981). Rhizobium strains WA16/1, CC131, and W118 are effective.  A peat culture containing the last strain is commercially available. Strains U45 and SU47 form nodules but do not fix nitrogen.<P> 'Sapo' has nodulated effectively with naturalized strains of rhizobia at all test sites in South Australia having alkaline, heavy textured soils (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>'Paraponto' is well adapted to Mediterranean-type environment. Native distribution extends throughout the Mediterranean basin (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>'Paraponto' can produce greater biomass by early winter than cv. 'Paragosa' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>'Paraponto' establishes relatively easily and has better seedling vigor than cv 'Paragosa' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Both (<I>Sminthurus viridis</I></B> L.) and red-legged earth mite (<I>Hdalotydeus destructor</I></B> Tucker) (editor's note: this pest is not found in the U.S.A.) are termed pests of 'Paragosa' in the Register of Australian Herbage Plant Cultivars, 'Paragosa,' 'Paraponto' and 'Sapo' have high tolerance to them (Mackay and Barnard.  1981).<P> Tolerances to Egyptian alfalfa weevil by 'Paragosa,' 'Paraponto,' and 'Sapo' are all listed as fair (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> Pests of 'Paragosa' reported in South Australia include: <I>Smythuris viridis</I></B> (lucerne flea), <I>Halotydeus destructor</I></B> (red-legged earth mite), <I>Telogryllus commodus </I></B>(cricket), <I>Etiella behrii</I></B> (lucerne pod borer), and <I>Sitona humeralis</I></B> (Sitona weevil) (Mackay and Barnard. 1981).<P> 'Sapo'is much more tolerant to damage by adult sitona weevil than are 'Paragosa,' 'Paraponto,' and all cultivars of barrel, strand and disc medics.  Tolerance to blue green aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B>) and spotted alfalfa aphid (<I>Therioaphis maculata</I></B>) in greenhouse and field tests is similar to 'Paragosa.' 'Sapo' produces high seed yields without the need of insecticde, whereas barrel, strand and disc medic cultivars require aphid control. 'Sapo' is a very poor host for the blue green aphid, being slightly more resistant than snail medic and much more tolerant than all <I>M. truncatula</I></B> cultivars.  Good swards tolerate lucerne flea (<I>Sminthurus viridis </I></B>L.).  Seedlings show high tolerance to attack by lucerne flea and by red-legged earth mite (<I>Hdalotydeus destructor</I></B>Tucker) (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Cv 'Sapo' is readily grazed by sheep; coumestrol content of matured pods with seeds is very low (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>All vegetative parts have dense hairs, including single-celled and glandular hairs.  The latter have long stalks with globular heads.  The upper surfaces of the leaflets are hairless, the lower surfaces densely haired.  The upper or inner surface of the stipule is hairless and the lower side hairy.  Three to five flowers occur per inflorescence, all on the same side of the flower stalk.  The flower stalk is shorter than the stalk of the corresponding leaf. The discoid pods have three or four anticlockwise coils and are soft at maturity.  The coils are not strongly pressed together and are covered with simple and glandular hairs.  Coils are concave or lozenge-shaped and, around the outer margins, the radiating veins on the coil surface are raised and distinct (Quinlivan et al.).<P> 'Paragosa' is an ascending or procumbent, freely branching, self- pollinating annual.  The leaflets are obovate, 1-1.5 cm long, 3/4 to 1 cm wide, terminating in a small tooth; they are glabrous on upper surface with small glandular hairs on lower surface, and upper third of leaflet usually serrated, sometimes deeply serrated. Stipule markedly toothed and open. Peduncle are with 2-5 flowers which are shorter than the subtending petiole, yellow, and small. Pods are flat, disc-shaped, 7-10 mm in diameter with conspicuous radiating veins, spineless with anti-clockwise whorls, usually two-seeded, rarely three or four (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Paraponto' is an erect, sparsely branched, self-pollinating herb that becomes lax with growth.  The leaflets are prominently purple flecked, obovate, 2-2.5 cm long, 1-1.25 cm wide, terminating in a small tooth; they are glabrous on the upper surface, densely covered with small glandular hairs on the lower surface, and upper third of the leaflets being deeply serrate. Leaf area rating 16-18 at the fifth to eight node.  Stipule prominent and toothed. Peduncle shorter than the subtending petiole, usually supporting four florets. Flowers are small and bright yellow.  Pods are flat, disc shaped 8-10 mm in diameter with prominent radiating veins, spineless with 3.5-4 anti-clockwise whorls, usually two-seeded (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Sapo' has a greater number of primary branches than cvv. `Paragosa' and `Paraponto', internode length being intermediate. The stems are green like those of cv.  `Paraponto.` The leaflets lack purple flecks, and the stipules are more densely hairy than `Paragosa` and `Paraponto.` Calyx are hairier than `Paragosa` and about equal to `Paraponto.` Flowers pale yellow, small, corolla striped like `Paragosa,` unlike `Paraponto.' The pod has 4-4.5 anticlockwise, spineless coils (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>There are one or two seeds per bur; these burrs are large (3 to 4.5 mm long and 2 to 3 mm broad); there are about 55,500 seeds per kg.  (Quinlivan et al.).<P> 'Paragosa' seed are dark yellow, curved to almost hooked, one per coil, and sides of the seed are comparatively rounded.  There are abpit 160,000 per kg (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Paragosa' is reputed to be relatively soft seeded and to have a higher number of seed to pod than barrel medic (Quinlivan et al.).<P> 'Paraponto' seed are dark yellow, curved to almost hooded, one per coil in the inner coils of the burr.  There are about 80,000 per kg.  This variety is relatively large seeded (12.5 mg per seed) (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Sapo' seeds are slightly larger than 'Paragosa', but smaller than 'Paraponto', with about 125,000 to 140,000 per kg (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>

<DD><I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> Desrousseaux (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Gama Medic (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Annual medics, <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa', <I>M scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', and <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvs 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong' were evaluated in 3 rotational systems. <I>Medicago</I></B> spp.  re-established better under permanent pasture than under any rotational scheme involving tillage. Seed preservation, however, was better in rotations involving tillage. <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa' in rotation trials produced a higher seed yield in the year of sowing than did <I>M. scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', or <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvv 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong'.  However, its seed bank persisted only 3 years, and its re-establishment was poor, perhaps due to its higher proportion of permeable seed.  <I>Medicago truncatula</I></B> cv 'Jemalong' maintained higher seed reserves after six years of cropping than <I>M. scutellata</I></B> cv 'Cyprus' or <I>M. scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson'.  Seed banks of all species were exhausted after 7 years (Crawford and Nankivell, 1989).<P>

<H1>Sources of Funding<BR>
</H1>
<H3><B>USDA Western Region <I>SARE/ACE </I>Grants</B></H3>
<P>
The Administrative Council of the USDA Western Region's Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education programs are now accepting
proposals for two very closely related competitive grant programs:
<BR>
<P>
1) The first is sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
(SARE), formerly known as LISA.  This program is funded through
the USDA Cooperative State Research Service.<BR>
<P>
2) The second program, with many of the same goals, is Agriculture
in Concert with the Environment (ACE), funded jointly by the Pollution
Prevention Office of EPA and the SARE program.<BR>
<P>
The federal funds available for these two programs are expected
to be the same as the last fiscal year.  Approximately $400,000
is available to fund new SARE proposals and $300,000 is available
from the ACE program for new competitive grants for the next cycle
(FY92-93).  Due to the limited funds, the call for proposals is
restricted to specific, high-priority projects to avoid having
to deny large numbers of worthwhile proposals.  Proposals are
due at 5 p.m. on November 13, 1992.  FAX copies will not be accepted.
 Proposal authors will be notified of decisions by early April
1993.  To be added to the Request for Proposals mailing list or
for further information contact <B>Denise Bodie</B>, University
of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
300 Lakeside Dr., 6th Floor Oakland, CA 94612-3560; phone: (510)
987-0033.
<H3><B>EPA Environmental Education Grants</B></H3>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will allocate money
for a grants program on environmental education projects at all
levels, including public education.  The deadline for applications
will be between October 1 and December 15, 1992 (no dates confirmed
at press time).  In fiscal year 1992, EPA allocated $2.5 million
to the program.  State and local education agencies, higher education
institutions and state environment agencies are eligible.  Eligible
projects include designing, demonstrating or disseminating environmental
curricula or field techniques; promoting understanding and assessing
a particular environmental issue or problem; training education
personnel in a specific geographic area; and designing and demonstrating
projects that foster cooperation between the U.S. and Canada or
Mexico on joint environmental concerns.  Priority will be given
to projects that develop environmental education practices or
methods that may have wide applications, address a high-priority
environmental issue, or are new or significantly improved.  For
more information, contact <B>George Walker</B>, Office of Environmental
Education, A107, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW,
Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260-3113.<BR>
<H3><B>Organic Research Grants</B></H3>
<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation is offering funds for
organic farming methods research, dissemination of research results
to organic farmers and growers interested in making the transition
to organic production systems, and education of the public about
organic farming issues.  Projects should involve farmers in both
design and execution, and take place on working farms when ever
possible and appropriate.  Proposals of  $3,000-5,000 are encouraged.
 Most projects will be less than $10,000.  Matching funds from
other sources and/or in-kind contributions from cooperators are
encouraged by not required.  Proposals are considered twice a
year.  Proposals received by January 31, l993 will be awarded
by April 30, 1992.  To receive copies of grant application procedures
and the &quot;OFRF Research and Education Priorities&quot; which
describes target areas, write Grants Program, Organic Farming
Research Foundation, P.O. Box 440, Santa Cruz, CA 95061 or call
(408) 426-6606.
<H3><B>$1000 Organic Article Award</B></H3>
<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation will award $1,000 to the
author of the best article published in 1992 aimed at educating
the general public about organic farming.  Articles must be published
between January 1, 1992 and December 31, l992 in a regularly published
newspaper journal or magazine.  Applications should include 15
copies of the article, including date published and page numbers;
name address and telephone number of the author(s); and information
about the periodical in which it was published, including exact
title, how long it has been in publication, purpose and audience,
and circulation (15 copies).  Applications must be received by
January 10, 1993 at Organic Farming Research Foundation, P.O.
Box 440, Santa Cruz, CA 95061.  For more information contact the
Foundation at (408) 426-6606.
<H3><B>Field Research Money</B></H3>
<P>
University Research Expeditions Program (UREP) provides funds
and field assistance to University of California researchers worldwide.
 Applicants need not qualify for principal investigator (P1) status.
 Support is provided by selected members of the public who subsidize
research costs through tax-deductible donations and contribute
their own skills and time as short-term field assistants.  UREP
funds can be used for short or long-term field research, as seed
money for new research, to extend continuing projects, supplement
other grants and support graduate students or additional staff.
 Proposal deadlines: October 5, 1992 (for projects during June-October
1993), and April 9, 1993 (for projects during November 1993-May
1994.)  For more information, contact University Research Expeditions
Program, Desk DO6, University of California, Berkeley, Ca 94720,

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Oat (Hitchcock, 1971; McLeod, 1982); cultivated oat (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name is <I>Avena sativa</I></B> L.; however, cultivated oat is of polyphyletic origin.  The common oat varieties used in temperate and mountain areas, including in the U.S.A., were derived from wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B> L.). Algerian oat and red oat are derived from <I>Avena byzantina</I></B> K.  Koch, whereas a few drought-tolerant varieties are derived from slender oat (<I>Avena barbata</I></B>) Brot.  (Hitchcock, 1971).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Oat is more palatable to livestock than cereal rye, and stock may destroy a cover crop of oat by overgrazing (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Oat can be grown on loam to heavy soil types (Madson, 1951) and is regarded as not being particular as to soil (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983) because it is adapted to many soil types.<P> Oat is more tolerant of wet soil than is barley.  Under moderate fertility and drainage oat tolerates a finer soil texture than does wheat or barley (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Oat can tolerate a soil pH as low as 4.5 (Stoskopf, 1985). Under moderate fertility and drainage, oat tolerates a wider pH range than wheat or barley and has a low lime requirement (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sowing can be conducted in the spring or fall (McLeod, 1982). In the northeastern U.S., plant in early fall (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  In California, October to January are recommended (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Oat seed remain viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Oat, a fibrous-rooted cool-season grass, is sometimes used as a catch crop to retain soil N that otherwise might leach through the profile as nitrate (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Mean nitrogen content of oat is 12 lb/a, according to Brinton (1989).  In an experiment on rotational cash crops ("break crops") for wheat farmers, fertilizer N requirements were increased by 10 kg/ha following winter oat, decreased by 30 kg/ha following winter rape, winter peas, spring faba beans, or cultivated fallow, and decreased by 40 kg/ha following spring peas (McEwen et al., 1989).<P> Incorporation of non-legume (high C:N ratio) residues (e.g., corn) led to depression of N availability greater than that for surface residues.  N availability was in this order for crop residues: alfalfa > peanut > soybean > oat > sorghum > wheat > corn (Smith and Sharpley, 1990).<P> Barley, oat, and wheat-straw mulches were tested in field trials in eastern Quebec forest plantations.  The mulches reduced soil nitrification, apparently through the production of five phenolic acids.  Growth rate and foliar nitrogen content were higher for black-spruce seedlings with mulches.  There were no other significant differences in nutrient status (Jobidon et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Jobidon et al.  (1989) tested barley, oat, and wheat-straw mulches as mulches for black spruce (<I>Picea mariana</I></B>) seedlings in greenhouse trials. The mulches of barley and wheat enhanced foliar phosphorus content, but mulches did not affect mycorrhizal infection or growth of black spruce.  All mulches decreased manganese content of the seedlings, however.<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Oat mean phosphorus content is 2 lb/a, and mean potassium content is 9 lb/a (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>'California Red' oat attained a height of 109.22+/-3.74 (cm, Mean +/- S.E.M.) in Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished data). Hitchcock (1971) reported that wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B>) reached 30-75 cm in height, whereas Munz (1973) reported 30-70 cm for wild oat and 30-60 cm for slender wild oat (<I>Avena barbata</I></B>).  Crampton (1974) listed the height of wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B>) as ranging from 25-100 cm.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Oat has a fibrous root system (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Oat harbors various grain aphids (e.g., bird cherry - oat aphid <I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B> and English grain aphid <I>Sitobion avenae</I></B>) that can attract lady beetles; oat does not host Russian wheat aphid (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>In the Northeast, oat is a common late-summer-sown cover crop which winterkills, leaving a protective dead mulch that is easily incorporated in the spring (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>'California Red' Oat produced 12.775+/-1.410 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) in above-ground dry biomass in Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  In the same trial, biomasses were 9.88 +/- 1.79 Mg/ha for 'Merced' cereal rye and 12.94 +/- 2.64 Mg/ha for 'U.C.  476' barley; none of the three values was deemed statistically different from the other two in the overall experiment.  Nonetheless, Miller (1984), stated that oat does not produce as much dry matter as barley, rye, or wheat, and that cereal rye produces more fall and early spring growth than oat.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Cereal rye matures earlier than oat (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Oat shows moderate resistance to cold (Madson, 1951).  Winter forms of oat are not as cold hardy as rye, triticale, wheat (Stoskopf, 1985), or barley (Miller, 1984).  A temperature of -8 degrees Centigrade is required to kill seedlings of oat or barley (Stoskopf, 1985).  Miller (1984) considered that oat is not as drought or cold resistant as barley, rye, or wheat (Miller, 1984).<P> Oat grows best in cool, moist climates, yet it is adapted to many climatic extremes.  It is an excellent winter cover crop in the South and in areas where winter freezes are not severe (McLeod, 1982).<P> Oat is susceptible to damage by hot, dry weather that occurs during reproduction (Stoskopf, 1985).  The best areas for oat production have relatively cool summers (Coffman, 1977).<P> In the Northeast, oat is a common late-summer-sown cover crop which winterkills, leaving a protective dead mulch that is easily incorporated in the spring (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>A temperature of -8 degrees C is required to kill seedlings of oat or barley (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Oat is an erect annual grass (Bugg, pers. comm.).  It has moderate to heavy density of growth and shows a succulent growth type (Madson, 1951).  Oat varieties usually have a lower ability to produce tillers than do barley varieties (Stoskopf, 1985).  Of the cereals, barley and oat have the poorest resistance to lodging (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Of the cereals, barley and oat have the poorest resistance to lodging (Stoskopf, 1985).  Barley is usually more competitive than oat (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The Southern Seedsmen's 1990-91 Directory and Buyers' Guide listed 43 oat varieties as being commercially available.  Few varieties of barley or oat are adapted coast to coast (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Oat varieties have been changed rapidly in response to development of new strains of pathogens (Coffman, 1977). However, modern oat cultivars show only minor improvements over older varieties.  There has been some improvement in root development (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> 'California Red' oat shows a fine growth and is the standard for hay production.  However, the fine growth that makes it good for hay also renders it susceptible to lodging and unsuitable for supporting intercropped vetches. It is a late-maturing cultivar, about 13 days later than cv 'Montezuma' (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P> Cv 'Cayuse' shows coarse growth and 14% higher biomass production on the average than 'California Red.' 'Cayuse' matures in early June, about 20 days after cv 'Montezuma' (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P> Cv 'Montezuma' matures early, from early to mid-May, with flowering beginning about a month earlier.  Fine stems make this variety less suited for intercropping with vetches.  Biomass production is about 93% of that of cv 'California Red (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).'<P> 'Ogle' is a cultivar of oat resistant to barley yellow dwarf virus (Schonbeck, 1988).  It shows coarse growth, high biomass production, and is regarded as an early-maturing form of cv 'Cayuse,' maturing ten days after cv 'Montezuma' (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Oat originated in North Africa, the Near East, and temperate Russia (McLeod, 1982), and the best areas for oat production have relatively cool summers (Coffman, 1977).  Few varieties of oat are adapted coast to coast (Stoskopf, 1985).  Oat is not as drought or cold resistant as barley, rye, or wheat (Miller, 1984).<P> The common oat varieties used in temperate and mountain areas, including in the U.S.A., were derived from wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B> L.). Algerian oat and red oat varieties are derived from <I>Avena byzantina</I></B> K. Koch, whereas a few drought-tolerant varieties are derived from slender oat (<I>Avena barbata</I></B> Brot.) (Hitchcock, 1971).  Munz (1973) mentioned that in California, cultivated oat is an occasional escape from cultivation, and that slender wild oat (<I>Avena barbata</I></B> Brot.) is a common weed in waste fields and open slopes, whereas wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B> L.) is a common weed of waste and cultivated areas.  Wild oat does best on rich soils, whereas slender wild oat is tolerant of a variety of soils (Crampton, 1974).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Oat (0.5% outcrossing) and barley (0.2% outcrossing) are mainly self-pollinated (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>All oat species are annual grasses (Crampton, 1974).  Oat (0.5% outcrossing) and barley (0.2% outcrossing) are mainly self-pollinated (Stoskopf, 1985). Oat varieties usually have a lower ability to produce tillers than do barley varieties (Stoskopf, 1985).  Cereal rye produces more fall and early spring growth than oat (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Oat is used in mixtures with common and hairy vetches, 'Austrian Winter' pea, and bell bean (Bugg, pers. comm.). Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990). Oat is especially suitable intercropped with vetch because oat seed is more easily separable from vetch seed than is barley, cereal rye, or wheat (Duke, 1981).  Oat can be used as a nurse crop in combination with slow-establishing legumes like white and yellow sweet clovers or sourclover which can help reduce weed problems (Bugg, pers. comm.). W.T.  Lanini reported that oat grown as an intercrop suppresses weeds in seeded or established alfalfa (Cantisano, pers. comm.). Oat is usually preferred over barley as a companion crop; barley is usually more competitive than oat (Stoskopf, 1985). Berseem clover can be grown in combination with white clover, oat, or rye (Duke, 1981).<P> Oat can be seeded into the sod of bermuda grass (Miller, 1984).<P> Monocultures of oat (<I>Avena sativa</I></B>, cv 'Mulga') or triticale yielded more dry matter and digestible organic matter than did bicultures involving common vetch (<I>Vicia sativa</I></B>) or pea (<I>Pisum sativum</I></B>).  Yields of mixtures did exceed those of monocultures of the relevant legumes. Digestibility and crude protein content were highest in mixtures of peas and triticale. There appears little incentive for farmers to grow mixtures of annual legumes and small-grained cereals for forage production (Droushiotis, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).  Oat can be used as a nurse crop in combination with slow-establishing legumes like white and yellow sweet clovers or sourclover (Duke, 1981). This can help reduce weed problems (Bugg, pers. comm.).  W.T. Lanini reported that oat grown as an intercrop suppresses weeds in seeded or established alfalfa (pers. comm.).  Oat is usually preferred instead of barley as a companion crop; barley is usually more competitive than oat (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Barley, oat, and wheat-straw mulches were tested in eastern Quebec forest plantations of balsam fir/birch.  The mulches inhibited red raspberry (<I>Rubus idaeus</I></B>) and reduced mean weed cover by 41%, apparently through the production of five phenolic acids (Jobidon et al., 1989a).<P> In a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990; harvest was on May 15-16, 1991. Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  Weed above-ground dry biomass in plots sown to 'California Red' oat was 0.241+/- 0.083 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (4.9% of the weed biomass in unseeded control plots).  This was not deemed significantly different than the weed biomasses obtained with 'U.C.  476' barley (0.043 +/- 0.043) Mg/ha or 'Merced' cereal rye (0.031 +/- 0.031 Mg/ha).  Vegetational cover by oat during early May was 98.75+/-1.25 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Oat can be used for hay, pasture, green manure or cover cropping; as a cover crop, oat can provide erosion control, enhance soil life, suppress weeds, and add organic matter (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  Oat can also serve as a temporary or rapidly growing cover crop (McLeod, 1982). Fast-growing annuals such as buckwheat or oat may be used to prepare for transplants or protect soil during short periods when it would otherwise be bare (Gershuny and Smillie, 1986).  Two successive cover crops of oat have been used to improve poor soil to the point that it sustains clover; oat can also serve as a temporary or rapidly growing cover crop and is more subject to winter damage than is cereal rye (McLeod, 1982).  In the North, late summer and early fall plantings are useful as winter cover (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  Top growth will eventually winter kill but can still serve as a mulch for erosion control (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  The protective dead mulch can is easily incorporated in the spring prior to planting vegetables (Schonbeck, 1988).  Oat can be used as a nurse crop in combination with slow-establishing legumes like white and yellow sweet clovers or sourclover which can help reduce weed problems (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Oat is usually preferred instead of barley as a companion crop (Stoskopf, 1985).  W.T. Lanini (pers. comm.) reported that oat grown as an intercrop suppresses weeds in seeded or established alfalfa.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates are given as 60 to 90 lbs/acre (McLeod, 1982; Miller et al., 1989) and 80-96 lbs/acre (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  Higher seeding rates of oat or barley may be appropriate where rainfall is heavy (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Oat is more tolerant of wet soil conditions than barley, and it requires more moisture than the other small grains (McLeod, 1982). Higher seeding rates of oat or barley may be appropriate where rainfall is heavy (Stoskopf, 1985).  In a study at the University of California, Davis, an oat cover crop turned under as green manure depleted soil water by 0.8" in the 0-24" soil stratum; by contrast, 'Lana' woollypod vetch depleted the same stratum by only 0.4" (Stivers and Shennan, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seeding depth should be 1 inch (McLeod, 1982.), and for barley or oat should be no greater than 5 cm (2 in.) (Stoskopf, 1985). Shallow seeding is possible in areas with high soil moisture and leads to more rapid emergence and lessened incidence of root rot disease (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>A firm seedbed prevents frost heaving of the plants from the soil during the winter (McLeod, 1982).  Barley or oat are usually planted in rows 15 to 20 cm apart (Stoskopf, 1985).  Oat can be seeded into the sod of bermuda grass (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Oat varieties have been changed rapidly in response to development of new strains of pathogens (Coffman, 1977).  'Ogle' is a cultivar of oat resistant to barley yellow dwarf virus (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Seeding depth for barley or oat should be no greater than 5 cm (2 in.). Shallow seeding is possible in areas with high soil moisture and leads to more rapid emergence and lessened incidence of root rot disease (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Winter oat, winter rape, winter peas, and spring faba beans as break crops greatly reduced the incidence of take-all of wheat (<I>Gaeumannomyces graminis</I></B>) (McEwen et al., 1989).<P>

<DD>Lemma glabrous; awns straight, often wanting (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>The wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B>) seedling has soft, succulent foliage, blade and sheath with very few widely spaced hairs, or if more abundant, these hairs require magnification to be visible; no auricles (ear-like projections) at the base of the leaf; the ligule (collar-like appendage on the inside of the leaf blade) is large, whitish, and pointed (Fischer et al., 1978).<P>

<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Suggested seeding rates have included 22-28 kg/ha (broadcast) (Duke, 1981), 10-20 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989), 20 to 25 lbs/acre (McLeod, 1982), and 20 to 90 kg/ha (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Sesbania has been characterized as a perennial woody shrub, but an annual at high latitudes (Duke, 1981).  Munz (1973) terms it an annual in California. In U.S.  agriculture, it is treated mainly as a summer annual legume (McLeod, 1982), and it grows rapidly during a 60- to 90-day summer growing period (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Sesbania, Cowpea, or <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> can follow crops such as early sweet corn and early processing tomatoes, and precede fall-planted crops such as vegetable brassicas and cereal grains (Miller et al., 1989).<P> According to Duke (1981), sesbania has been used as a warm-season cover crop in citrus from Florida to southern California, and on irrigated lands is sometimes used in rotation with vegetable crops. The Yuma Indians use the plant to produce a strong, lustrous fiber for making nets and fishing lines.<P> Sesbania is sometimes used for wildlife enhancement in southern Georgia. Plantings along orchard borders may do double duty by providing habitat to game birds and predatory insects (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).  As a drought-intolerant species, it might be suitable as a summer cover crop in moist, low-lying (pecan) groves or in orchards with solid-set irrigation (Bugg et al., 1991).<P> When sesbania is used as a green manure, its roots are said to open up subsoil (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that sesbania tolerates mean annual precipitation of 6.2-23.2 dm, with a mean of 12 cases of 13.1, and that it does best on moist soils.  Yost and Evans (1988) indicated that sesbania does best with moderate to abundant rainfall but tolerates drought once established.  They further mentioned that it can be used in semiarid areas, germinating with seasonal rains and maturing during dry periods; it tolerates soil waterlogging and flooding.  Sesbania requires more water than other summer legumes, such as crotalaria or cowpea, but also tolerates waterlogged soils better (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Sesbania can tolerate heavy, waterlogged soils (Yost and Evans, 1988; Miller et al., 1989;) and flooding (Yost and Evans, 1988). It purportedly will grow on any soil, including those that are infertile, and has a low lime requirement; best growth is on rich loams (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Sesbania is not a good weed competitor as a seedling, it can reach 10 feet in height in 60 days of hot summer weather (Miller et al., 1989).  When grown in wildlife plantings, sesbania requires at least one cultivation to reduce weeds (Duke, 1981).  Bugg and Dutcher (1989) evaluated weediness in various warm-season cover crops grown in a pecan orchard in southern Georgia, and found sesbania to be especially prone to weed invasion.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Sesbania is mentioned as attaining heights of 10-30 dm (Munz, 1973), 10 feet (Miller et al., 1989), and 1-4 m (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>According to Miller et al.  (1989), the stiff tall stems of sesbania leave a great deal of residue.  Phytomass (dry) production is about 1,500 kg/ha (Evans and Rotar, 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>The growth habit is erect (Bugg et al., 1989).  Sesbania is described by Munz (1973) as a glabrous annual attaining heights of from 10-30 dm.  It has stiff tall stems, and can reach 10 feet in height in 60 days of hot summer weather (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Sesbania is easily killed by frost and tolerates an annual mean temperature of 12.5-27.8 degrees C, with the mean of 12 cases being 13.1 (Duke, 1981).  It should be established during late spring or during summer (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The genus <I>Sesbania</I></B> comprises several species of agricultural value, including <I>Sesbania bispinosa</I></B> (Jacq.) W.F. Wight (Duke, 1981; Miller et al., 1989) which is often called by its former name, <I>S. aculeata</I></B> (Yost and Evans, 1988), <I>Sesbania rostrata</I></B>, <I>Sesbania sesban</I></B>, and <I>Sesbania exaltata</I></B> (Raf.) Rydb.  (Duke, 1981).  The latter species is termed <I>Sesbania exaltata</I></B> (Rafinesque-Schmaltz) Cory by Munz (1973).  This treatment will be principally confined to the latter.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD><I>Sesbania exaltata</I></B> is variously termed Sesbania, Colorado River hemp, hemp, hemp sesbania, and peatree (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Sesbania is from the North American Center of Diversity and is native to coastal parts of the United States, including southern California, Arizona, and the Southeast.  It ranges from the Warm Temperate Moist through Tropical Dry Forest Life Zone (Duke, 1981).<P> In general, it is adapted to warm lowland tropical and subtropical areas (Yost and Evans, 1988).  It does best with high temperatures, low relative humidities, and moist soils, growing exceptionally well in the Southwest where these conditions are met.<P> It tolerates higher altitudes than crotalaria (McLeod, 1982). In California, it occurs in overflow lands and along ditches in Alkali Sink, Imperial County, eastern Riverside County, and in La Verne, Los Angeles County.  It also ranges to the Atlantic Coast and Central America (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Sesbania tolerates salinity (McLeod, 1982; Yost and Evans. 1988) and has been used as a green manure for reclaiming saline soils in India, often in conjunction with gypsum (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Suggested sowing depth in 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982), but seed can be broadcast (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>N content is about 65 kg/ha (Evans and Rotar, 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Sesbania tolerates soil pH of from 4.5-7.2, with the mean of 10 cases being 6.2 (Duke, 1981).  It is said to tolerate alkalinity (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Sesbania produces seeds profusely and can become a weed if not properly managed.  Plants should be harvested for seed when about two-thirds of the seed has begun to turn from green or purple to brown (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seed is of variable hardness; scarification is needed for complete germination (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Specific <I>Rhizobium</I></B> inoculant is necessary in most situations unless effectively nodulated crops have ben grown previously (Yost and Evans, 1988). Sesbania should receive "Special Culture 1 For <I>Sesbania</I></B>" (Duke, 1981) ("Sesbania Spec.  1", Nitragin Co., Burton and Martinez, 1980).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Sesbania flowers from April to October in the wild (Munz, 1973), but with normal practices in the Sacramento Valley, it blooms from mid-July to October (Bugg,pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Grown as a summer cover crop in pecan orchards, sesbania often harbors cowpea aphid (<I>Aphis craccivora</I></B>) and bandedwinged whitefly (<I>Trialeurodes abutilonea</I></B>), and has associated lady beetles when pecan aphids become depleted (Bugg et al., 1989). When densities of pecan aphids dropped during July or August, whitefly-infested understory stands of sesbania arrested and retained high densities of convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville), and the principally-arboreal <I>Ollavnigrum</I></B> (Mulsant).  Although adult lady beetles were significantly more abundant in cover-cropped than in control understoreys of resident vegetation from early August through mid September, this did not contribute to increased coccinellid densities in the associated pecan trees, nor to reduction of pecan aphids (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989; Bugg and Dutcher, 1993).<P> Red imported fire ant was abundant in experimental orchard, yet few ants were seen on sesbania, despite the frequent abundance of cowpea aphid.  We have often observed ants tending colonies of this aphid on cowpea, but never on sesbania (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>As reported by Duke (1981), sesbania is a perennial semiwoody herb, except where frost-killed yearly, and it behaves as an annual.  Plant is 0.4-4 m in height, stems striate and glabrous. Leaves pinnate and 10 cm long or less, bright green, elongate. 20-80 leaflets per leaf, linear-oblong, 1-3 cm in length, pale green, villous below.  Flowers yellow with purple or brown spots or streaks, presented in axillary racemes with few flowers.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Sesbania is shallow rooted compared to other summer legumes and may require irrigation until well established (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Sesbania can be sown in mixtures with browntop millet, proso or hog millet, and beggarweed to provide quail food (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Sesbania can be sown in mixtures with browntop millet, proso or hog millet, and beggarweed to provide quail food (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Sesbania can be established in perennial warm-season sod by herbiciding with glyphosate, the broadcasting the seed and disking to break up sod and incorporate seed (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sesbania should be established during late spring or during summer (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that the following plant-parasitic nematodes have been isolated from sesbania: <I>Belonolaimus longicaudatus</I></B>,  <I>Dolichodorus heterocephalus</I></B>, <I>Heterodera glycines</I></B>, <I>H.  schachtii</I></B>, <I>H. trifolii</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B>, <I>M.  incognita acrita</I></B>, <I>M. javanica</I></B>, and <I>Pratylenchus pratensis</I></B>.<P> Sting nematode was abundant and caused reduced yields for cool- season vegetables following cover cropping with a sorghum X Sudan grass hybrid or <I>Sesbania exaltata</I></B>.  Rootknot nematode, <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B>, failed to develop high densities on any of the cover crops, but was particularly abundant on vegetables following sesbania and cowpea (Rhoades, 1983).<P> Sting nematode was abundant and caused reduced yields for cool-season vegetables following cover cropping with <I>Sesbania exaltata</I></B> (Rhoades, 1983).<P>

<DD>In wildlife plantings, sesbania is sown "with ample fertilizer" and equal parts of browntop millet, proso or hog millet, and beggarweed (Duke, 1981).<P> Bugg and Dutcher (1993) grew sesbania in combination with other warm-season cover crops in pecan orchards.  Satisfactory stands were obtained with the following per ha fertilization rates: in orchard #1, 11.51 kg/ha of P205 (N:P:K 0-46-0) and 1.92 kg/ha K20 (0-0-60); in orchard #2, 14.77 kg/ha P205 and 2.46kg/ha  K20; in orchard #3, 11.92 kg P205 and 1.99 kg/ha K20.<P>

<H1>Social, Economic Issues Focus of Sustainable Conference<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>The UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program
hosted a June conference aimed at broadening the concept of sustainable
agriculture to include social needs and human welfare, in addition
to environmental issues. It attracted 160 researchers, farmers,
policymakers, public interest group representatives, and consumers.
The following is a summary of an article on the conference by
</I><B>Debra Van Dusen</B>, <I>Agroecology Program agricultural
issues assistant analyst. The full article will appear in the
Summer 1990 issue of the Agroecology Program newsletter </I><B>Cultivar</B>.
<I>A paper summarizing the findings of the conference will be
available this winter from </I>Barbara Laurence <I>Agroecology
Program, University of California Santa Cruz, CA 95064, (408)459-3240.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
The conference <I>Sustainable Agriculture: Balancing Social Environmental
and Economic Concerns </I>was created to &quot;make visible some
of the most pressing social issues that we confront in the food
and agriculture system,&quot; said <B>Patricia Allen</B>, senior
analyst with the Agroecology Program and one of the event's primary
organizers. The two main themes of the conference were redefining
sustainable agriculture to explicitly include the social component,
and exploring issues which need to be resolved if social and ethical
concerns are to become an active part of agricultural sustainability.
<BR>
<P>
Many meanings of sustainability center around environmentally-benign
farming practices, including biological control or organic farming
methods. Some emphasize land stewardship and preservation of the
family farm. For many researchers, it means a systems perspective
that includes not only farm practices, but the complex set of
interactions that tie them to the environment and to agriculture's
larger socioeconomic context. A major challenge to implementing
sustainability is not only to resolve differences in how the concept
is defined and consequently how its goals and policies are structured,
but to recognize how social and ethical issues factor into the
equation.
<H3>Social, Ethical Concerns</H3>
<P>
Although social and ethical issues are not as frequently addressed
as environmental and economic ones, they are considered essential
by a growing number of people in the food and agriculture system.
One reason is that agriculture's goal of feeding the world's people
is often confounded by social, political and ethical factors that
limit people's access to food - factors that result in poverty,
and lack of access to land and farm credit. Increasingly, agricultural
practices that perpetuate inhumane and substandard conditions
for humans and other species are seen in the same light as harmful
environmental practices. The most commonly recognized problems
 of  agriculture,  including  polluted groundwater, depletion
of nonrenewable resources, and adverse affects on rural communities,
cannot be resolved solely by adopting environmentally-benign farming
practices. Too often purely technological solutions are proposed
in the name of sustainability without considering how such technology
will actually be used, who will benefit from it, and who will
not.<BR>
<P>
<B>Bill Friedland</B>, UC Santa Cruz Social Sciences Division
dean and professor of community studies and sociology, noted that
sustainability is inextricably bound with forms of human organization.
&quot;It's human beings that either create, or uncreate sustainability,&quot;
he said, noting that processes such as desertification and global
warming are due not to the functions of the biosphere, but rather
how humans organize themselves and influence those functions as
a result.
<H3>Identifying Issues</H3>
<P>
Conference discussions about defining sustainable agriculture
centered around defining who and what will be sustained, and at
what levels. Most participants agreed that under optimal conditions,
all human beings (present and future) should be assured adequate
and nutritious food, obtained without degrading the earth's natural
resources and with minimal interference in natural ecosystems
and other species' life cycles. Several principles were identified:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Respecting the lives of others and their right to a decent
standard of living. Until we broaden the definition of &quot;community,&quot;
our decisions will continue to contribute to cultural destruction,
poverty, and hunger in other societies.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Respecting the biosphere. The trend toward cost accounting
in managing natural resources as assets that can be depreciated
is a step toward more conservation-oriented management. Natural
resources must also be valued as more than economic assets.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Understanding sustainable agriculture as an intricate system.
Applied research and policymaking in sustainability must move
beyond the farm level to an understanding of how sustainability
operates in bioregions, nations and international food systems.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>New Issues, Questions</H3>
<P>
<B>Dick Norgaard</B>, UC Berkeley Energy and Resources Group,
noted that the conference was &quot;about equity, social justice,
and spreading the benefits of a sustainable agriculture across
more people. It's not simply about sustaining soil.&quot;<BR>
<P>
To achieve this goal, two concepts are important: <I>empowering
people to take action </I>by increasing their access to the information
and resources necessary to control the conditions of their livelihoods;
and <I>democratizing the decision-making process </I>of agriculture
so that the concerns of all members of society are fairly represented
when policies affecting their welfare are created.<BR>
<P>
Many ideas and questions were offered at the conference that related
to these processes. Economic issues raised included the concentration
of agriculture, government subsidies, externalized costs, comparing
sustainable and conventional methods, equal access to foods grown
with fewer pesticides, international trade relations and rural
poverty, and the free market economy and sustainability. Land
use issues discussed included land tenure, urban development,
farm size, and access to land. Research questions raised included
interdisciplinary focus, broadening the research agenda, conserving
indigenous knowledge, and recognizing the role of values in science.
<BR>
<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
Although questions raised at the conference are not new, what
is new are attempts by many individuals and groups to integrate
them into the research departments and policymaking arenas where
most agricultural technologies and strategies are developed and
implemented. That initiative, according to Norgaard, is increasingly
being taken not by government and public research institutions,
but by nongovernmental organizations. Yet as <B>David Goodman</B>,
a conference speaker from the Department of Economics, University
College, London observed, &quot;We need to be prepared to host
this more radical questioning of the food system.&quot; There
is a critical need for government and university institutions,
with their powerful resources, to be among those moving to address
these issues. <BR>

<I>Emily B. Roberson, Shlomo Sarig and Mary K. Firestone <BR>
</I>
<P>
Soil sc. Soc. Amer. J . 55: 734- 73s . 1991 <BR>

<P>
Cover cropping may affect soil structure by supporting the growth
of soil microbes. Some of these microorganisms produce polysaccharides
that in turn promote the formation of water-stable aggregates,
particles of soil resistant to erosion by water. This phenomenon
leads to improved soil structure and increased rates of water
infiltration. In the present study, various understory-management
regimes were applied to experimental plots in a flood-irrigated
prune orchard in Gridley, Butte County, California, in order to
determine various effects on the loam soil. Understory management
regimes were as follows: 1) permanent cover with perennial ryegrass,
<I>Lolium perenne</I>; 2) annual cover occasionally mowed, using
the fall-sown cereals barley, <I>Hordeum vulgare</I>, or wheat,
<I>Triticum aestivum</I>; 3) fall-sown barley or wheat killed
in May using glyphosate (this substantially decreased the biomass
provided by the cereals); and 4) clean-cultivation using occasional
disking to break surface crusts and reduce weeds. <BR>

<P>
Soils were sampled after the treatments had been applied for two
growing seasons. Soil samples were taken in the crusted layer
(0-2 cm deep), and in a deeper stratum (2-10 cm deep). The following
response variables were assessed in the laboratory: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>saturated hydraulic conductivity (a measurement of water permeability);

<LI>mean weight diameter of soil particles (the weighted average
of soil mass occurring in four size classes); 
<LI>aggregate slaking resistance of particles ranging in diameter
from 0.3-2.0 mm (this property was assessed using two methods,
both of which gauge the proportion of soil remaining in a 0.3-mm
sieve after water is poured over the soil); 
<LI>organic carbon (all forms, including carbohydrates); 
<LI>microbial biomass carbon; 
<LI>heavy-fraction carbohydrates (which are believed to be to
a large extent of microbial origin and to include a high proportion
of the polysaccharides associated with aggregates); 
<LI>light-fraction carbohydrates (removed by flotation from the
heavy-fraction carbohydrate, and including most of the undecomposed
plant residue). 
</OL>

<P>

<P>
Data were assessed using appropriate analysis of variance (ANOVA)
models followed by mean separation by single degree of freedom
linear contrasts. Results are summarized in table 1. Response
variables are listed in column headings; treatments followed by
the same letter are deemed not significantly different for the
relevant response variables. Results indicated that permanent
cover and mowed barley led to especially high values for saturated
hydraulic conductivity, aggregate slaking resistance, and heavy-fraction
carbohydrate. Correlation analysis showed that both microbial
biomass carbon and heavy-fraction carbohydrates were highly correlated
with aggregate slaking resistance and saturated hydraulic conductivity.
Multiple regression showed that heavy-fraction carbohydrates were
a better predictor of aggregate slaking resistance and saturated
hydraulic conductivity than were light-fraction carbohydrates,
organic carbon, or microbial biomass carbon. <BR>

<P>
The higher amounts of carbon available to microbes in the permanent
cover and mowed barley treatments appear to translate into improved
soil structure. This effect was related to short-term increases
in the heavy-fraction carbohydrates, but was not reflected in
statistically higher concentrations of total organic carbon or
microbial biomass carbon. <BR>

<P>
The loam soil in this study had low organic matter, little structure,
and was very prone to crusting. Thus, it was more susceptible
than some other soils to rapid improvement through additions of
organic matter Also, in other soil types, clay, humified organic
matter, or iron oxides may be more important in the aggregation
process. <BR>

<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Bugg et al.  (1991a) used "dying mulches" of cool-season cover crops in efforts to enhance biological control of insect pests on succeeding spring plantings of cantaloupe (<I>Cucumis melo</I></B> L. var.  <I>reticulatus</I></B> Seringe).  Eight cover-crop regimes were tested in a replicated trial.  Cereal rye was particularly poor habitat for <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B>, an important generalist predator in vegetable and field crops.  Especially good habitat was provided by 'Mt.  Barker' subterranean clover.<P> Bugg et al.  (1990) evaluated 20 cover-cropping regimes and associated insects, and found that convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville]) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) first were found in substantial numbers on rye (which harbored bird cherry - oat aphid [<I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B> {L}]), then on crimson clover and lentil, later on subterranean clover, still later on narrow-leafed lupin, then on hairy vetch, and lastly on mustard and collard.<P> Haley and Hogue (1990) assessed influence of type of ground cover on apple aphid, <I>Aphis pomi</I></B> DeGeer (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its predators in a young apple orchard, four ground cover regimes were compared: (1) fall cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>), herbicided in spring and summer; (2) a mixture of white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I></B>) and grass; (3) herbicided tree-row strips and grassed-in alleys; and (4) woven black-plastic strips in the tree row and grassed alleys.  The trial was initiated at the beginning of the second year of the orchard.  Few aphidophagous insects of interest (e.g., the predatory mirids <I>Deraeocoris brevis</I></B> and <I>Campylomma verbasci</I></B>, the predatory midge <I>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</I></B>, lady beetles, hover flies, or lacewings), were found in the ground covers.  In the first year of the study, leaf nitrogen and aphid and predator densities were lower on trees with the white clover-grass mixture.  These differences did not occur the second year. Terminal growth was particularly depressed for apple trees with understories of white clover and grass.<P> Bugg et al.  (1991b) in southern Georgia, found that in mature pecan orchards under minimal or commercial management, cool-season understory cover crops of hairy vetch, <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth, and rye, <I>Secale cereale</I></B> (L.), sustained significantly higher densities of aphidophagous lady beetles than did unmown resident vegetation or mowed grasses and weeds.  In cover-cropped understories, mean densities of aphidophagous coccinellids were nearly 6 X greater than in unmown resident vegetation and approximately 87 X greater than in mown grasses and weeds.  During late winter and spring, rye harbored abundant bird cherry - oat aphid, <I>Rhopalosiphum padi </I></B> L., whereas hairy vetch sustained pea aphid, <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> (Harris); blue alfalfa aphid, <I>A.  kondoi </I></B>Shinji; and thrips, <I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp.  The following aphidophagous lady beetles were adundant in cover-cropped understories: (1) convergent lady beetle, <I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville; (2) <I>Olla v-nigrum</I></B> (Mulsant); and (3) seven-spotted lady beetle, <I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> L.  In the orchard under minimal management, there was evidence that the rye/vetch mixture led to enhanced densities of convergent lady beetle in the pecan trees.  No other effects on coccinellids were seen, and there was no evidence of improved biological control of pecan aphids.<P> In the minimal-management orchard, lady beetles occurred on rye in substantial densities from early April through early May.  By contrast, attendance on hairy vetch extended from early April until early June for <I>H. convergens</I></B> and <I>C. septempunctata</I></B>.  On the other hand, by early May, <I>O. v-nigrum</I></B> had had almost entirely left the understory and entered the pecan canopy.  From mid April through early May, O. v-nigrum was mainly associated with pecan catkins, which contained abundant thrips (mainly <I>Frankliniella tritici</I></B> [Fitch] and <I>F.  bispinosa</I></B> [Morgan]).  In the commercial orchard, convergent lady beetle occurred predominantly on rye from early April through early May, and thereafter was found mostly on hairy vetch. <I>Olla v-nigrum</I></B> relied almost exclusively on rye through early May, by which time many of the beetles had dispersed to the pecan catkins, as in the Tifton study.  Seven-spotted lady beetle relied substantially on rye from late April until mid May, and from early through late May on hairy vetch. Coccinellid larvae appeared to concentrate almost exclusively on the bird cherry - oat aphid on rye, from early May through early June (Bugg et al., 1991b).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Cereal rye can be sown with legumes or other grasses (Miller, 1984).  For example, berseem clover can be grown in combination with white clover, oat, or rye (Duke, 1981).  Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) suggested that cereal rye be seeded at 56 lbs/acre when sown with clover.  Cv 'Wrens Abruzzi' was dominant when sown in a mixture with six other cover crops (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Cereal rye is often sown along with vetches, for which it provides structural support.  Hairy vetch (20 lb/a) and cereal rye (70 lb/a) can be grown in biculture in the winter, then managed no-till by mowing (rather than herbicides) and the residue manipulated to suppress weeds yet allow development of a crop of corn. Surface-feeding Lumbricidae (earthworms) are apparently responsible for ensuring efficient availability of nitrogen to the economic crop.  This system has been perfected for Virginia, and may prove useful elsewhere, with some modifications (Luna and Rutherford, 1989).<P> Cereal rye/hairy vetch biculture also appears useful in southern Georgian pecan orchards, where it can provide a seasonal sequence of aphid prey to lady beetles: first bird cherry - oat aphid (<I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B>) on rye, and pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B>) later on the vetch (Bugg et al., 1991).<P> Cereal rye has performed well when overseeded into field corn, sweet corn, or brassica crops (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Rye produces several compounds that inhibit crops and weeds.  The most active compounds are two hydroxamic acids and their breakdown products (Chase et al., 1991).<P> Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Cereal rye mean phosphorus content is 2-3 lb/a, and mean potassium content is 10-11 lb/a based on biomass estimates of only 1,100-1,300 lb/a of dry biomass according to Brinton (1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>In general, drill into prepared seedbed or broadcast and disk lightly or cultipack to cover (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Cereal rye can be seeded into Bermuda grass sod in pecan orchards during early to late autumn by mowing the sod closely and seeding with a no-till drill.  Alternatively, seed can be broadcast and the sod disked lightly (Bugg, R.L, Pers. comm.).<P> Scott and Burt (1985) describe studies in New York state where rye or wheat can be seeded in late summer or early autumn.  If late seeding is needed, rye will perform better because it shows better growth during cold weather.  Cover crops evaluated after overseeding into corn of 6-18" high were medium red clover, mammoth red clover, alfalfa, yellow sweetclover, alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, Canada field peas, Austrian winter peas, cowpeas, perennial or annual ryegrass, medium red clover + ryegrass, or medium red clover + rye.  Of these, alfalfa, medium red clover, yellow sweetclover, hairy vetch, ryegrass, and medium red clover + ryegrass have performed well. Species tested following overseeding while corn is tasseling through silking included rye, perennial or annual ryegrass, buckwheat, medium red clover, and hairy vetch. Rye was the only crop that consistently performed well under these conditions.  In practice, rye used in this context would be seeded aerially.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is not a legume and requires no inoculation with rhizobia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cereal rye seed is inexpensive (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Hitchcock (1971) described cereal rye as an erect annual grass with flat blades and dense spikes; habit resembles that of wheat, but usually taller, the spike longer and more slender, somewhwat nodding.  Munz (1973) described the species as a tufted annual 1-1.5 m tall, blue green, blades to ca.  12 mm broad, long pointed, spike slender, 7-15 cm long.<P> According to Stoskopf (1985), cereal rye plants are taller than those of wheat and tiller less.  The flag leaf is smaller and less important in photosynthesis; leaves have a bluish color. Vegetative growth for cereal rye requires a temperature of at least 4 degrees C .<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Cereal rye can be seeded very late in the fall (Brinton, 1989); it requires temperatures of 3-5 degrees centigrade or higher to germinate, with the optimal range being 25-31 degrees. (Starzycki, 1976).  In the Northeast, it can be established when seeded as late as October 1 (Schonbeck, 1988).  This presumably means that in most of California, it can be established when seeded in December (Bugg., pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>There are relatively few varieties of cereal rye available (Stoskopf, 1985); 28 varieties were listed in the Southern Seedsmen's Association Directory and Buyers' Guide, 1990-91 (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Although cereal rye is usually regarded as a winter crop, spring-sown varieties are available (Stoskopf, 1985). Drought tolerance among varieties varies, with diploid varieties more tolerant than those that are tetraploid (Starzycki, 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Cereal rye grain and straw have relatively low quality as livestock feed (Bushuk, 1976.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Schonbeck (1988) mentioned that cereal rye can regrow following tillage, particularly if tilled under when 8 inches or less in height.  There is less difficulty when rye is incorporated after it has attained a height of 12 inches, though one grower disputed this.<P> Cereal rye has been shown to be allelopathic towards other plants, but some of the suppressive effects may relate to tie-up of soil nitrogen by decomposing rye residues.  If rye is incorporated while under 16 inches in height and the tissue is still sweet to the taste, this sort of tie-up can supposedly be minimized (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Cereal rye can inhibit germination or growth of vegetable crops sown after rye is incorporated (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Cereal rye may stabilize and prevent leaching of excess soil or manure nitrogen (Schonbeck, 1988).  Benkenstein et al.  (1990) reported that point placements of labeled ammonium sulfate and sodium nitrate at depths of 40, 60, and 80 cm under growing cereal rye plants resulted in the arrest of some 72% of the nitrate evolving from the 40 cm placement, and 18% from the 80 cm depth. Mean N content of three year field trial in Georgia was 38 kg/ha (Hargrove, 1986), whereas Brinton (1989.) listed a mean nitrogen content of 7-14 lb/a.<P> Schonbeck (1988) noted that cereal rye has been shown to be allelopathic towards other plants, but some of the suppressive effects may relate to tie-up of soil nitrogen by decomposing rye residues.  If rye is incorporated while under 16 inches in height and the tissue is still sweet to the taste, this sort of tie-up can supposedly be minimized.<P> McCracken et al.  (1989) documented first-year residual effects of nitrogen fertilization and cover crops of hairy vetch and rye in corn.  Control plots used corn stover alone.  One year after discontinuing the practice, the residual effect of N-fertilization was to increase N uptake by corn by 20.4 kg/ha over that seen with corn residue alone.  With hairy vetch, uptake by corn was higher by 28.0 kg/ha.  Holdover effects of rye cover cropping were small and inconsistent.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is useful for preventing wind or water erosion. (Miller, 1984); it may be of some value in providing windbreaks (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Young (1922) conducted an unreplicated study upon which have been based many subsequent generalizations about cover-crop effect on temperatures in citrus groves.  A 6-acre grove was divided into 2, 3-acre sections.  A cover crop of sourclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B>, 30 lb/a) mixed with rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>, 10 lb/a) and some purple vetch (<I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B>) was established. Locations of two temperature stations were assigned based on similarity of low temperatures when dense cover crops were present in both sections.  On January 18, 1922, the northern half of the orchard was ploughed, but the cover crop in the southern half was left intact.  Conditions were wet during this study.  Temperature measurements were made for 16 nights of frost, including the exceptionally-cold spell from Januay 19-23, which included the coldest weather in southern California since 1913.  Sheltered thermometers showed that 10 inches above the ground the cover-cropped plot was, on average, approximately 2 degrees F colder than the clean-cultivated plot during the night.  The only effect at 5 feet above ground was to decrease the rate of temperature rise during the morning. Unsheltered thermometers showed that depression of minimum temperatures was about 2.4 degrees F at 7 inches above the ground, and 0.4 degrees F at 24 inches above the ground.  At times when air temperatures were falling rapidly, the temperature at 7 inches could be as much as 11 degrees colder in the cover-cropped plot.  The results suggest that cover crops do increase the risk of frost, but only to a slight extent.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Cereal rye grows best with ample moisture, but in general it does better in low rainfall regions than do legumes (McLeod, 1982), and it can outyield other cereals on droughty, sandy, infertile soils (Stoskopf, 1985).  Its extensive root system enables it to be the most drought-tolerant cereal crop, and its maturation date can alter based on moisture availability (Evans and Scoles, 1976). Maturation date of cereal rye varies according to soil moisture, but vegetative growth stops once reproduction begins (Stoskopf, 1985).  The structure of the rye plant enables it to capture and hold protective snow cover, which enhances winter-hardiness (Stoskopf, 1985); this snow retention might also be expected to enhance water availability.  Drought tolerance among cereal rye varieties varies: diploid varieties are more tolerant than are those that are tetraploid (Starzycki, 1976).  Cereal rye is more drought tolerant than oat (Miller, 1984), and Starzycki (1976) indicated that cereal rye requires 20-30% less water than wheat per unit of dry matter formation, but this point has not been tested scientifically, according to Stoskopf (1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is well known to tolerate acid soil (McLeod, 1982). The range of best suitability is pH 5.0-7.0, but tolerance is between 4.5 and 8.0 (Stoskopf, 1985).  Cereal rye has the widest range of adaptation of all cereals because of its great winter hardiness and tolerance of marginal soils, and it can be grown in soils too acidic for wheat (Evans and Scoles, 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is a long-day plant and flowering is induced by 14 hours of daylight accompanied by temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees C (Stoskopf, 1985). Munz (1973) stated that in California flowering occurs from May-August, which suggests that seed maturation would occur from May-September.  Cereal rye matures earlier than oat (Miller, 1984).  Maturation date can alter based on moisture availability, but vegetative growth stops once reproduction begins (Stoskopf, 1985).  Evans and Scoles (1976) said that the extensive root system of cereal rye enables it to be the most drought-tolerant cereal crop, and its maturation date can alter based on moisture availability.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Cereal rye has the best-developed root system among annual cereal crops (Starzycki, 1976) as with other grasses, the system is fibrous, with no defined taproot (Bugg, pers. comm.).  The extensive root system enables it to be the most drought-tolerant cereal crop (Evans and Scoles, 1976) and makes it among the best green manures for improving soil structure (Pears et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is an erect annual grass (Hitchcock, 1971).  Based on the account by Gawronska and Nalborczyk (1989), it has the longest stems of all cultivated small grains, and these provide most of the photosynthetic area.  During grain formation, stems with sheaths account for 60-80% of the total plant area.  At grain set, 15-20% of the photosynthetic area is provided by leaf blades; this area is much lower than for maize, wheat, and oat. Stems and sheaths have lower rates of photosynthesis and export of assimilates than do leaves.  For winter rye, photosynthetic area decreases rapidly after grain set, and does not maintain a plateau near the maximum, as seen with other grains.  These features were consistent across the six cultivars assessed. Taken together, these factors suggest that winter rye grain formation occurs under unfavorable physiological conditions for yielding.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>According to Stoskopf (1985), average height of cereal rye is 147 cm, and range is from 139 to 154.  Heights of winter rye varieties (in cm) were as follows: 'Dankowske Zlote', 144.8; 'Dankowskie Nowe', 137.4; 'Pancerne', 144.0; 'Kustro', 134.2; 'Wojcieszyckie', 161.2; and 'Viatka', 188.9 (Gawronska and Nalborczyk, 1989b).  Cv 'Wintergrazer' is shorter than cv.  'Wrens Abruzzi' (which attains a height of over 72") (Bugg, pers. comm.). Cv 'Merced' reached a height of 148.59+/-7.59 cm, mean +/- S.E.M., (58.50 +/- 2.99 inches) in Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is an annual grass (Hitchcock, 1971; McLeod, 1982). In the Northeast, it can be established when seeded as late as October 1 (Schonbeck, 1988).  Minimal temperatures for germinating cereal rye seed have been variously given as 3 to 5, 0.6, and 1 to 2 degrees C; optimal range has been given as 25 to 31 and 13 to 18 degrees C (Stoskopf, 1985).  Starzycki (1976) stated that 3-5 degrees C or higher is required to germinate, with the optimal range being 25-31 degrees.  According to Stoskopf (1985), for vegetative growth to occur, a minimum temperature of 4 degrees C is required.  Once well established, cereal rye can withstand temperatures as low as -35 degrees C (-31 degrees F) (Stoskopf, 1985).  The structure of the rye plant enables it to capture and hold protective snow cover, which enhances winter-hardiness (Stoskopf, 1985).  Cereal rye is a long-day plant and flowering is induced by 14 hours of daylight accompanied by temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees C (Stoskopf, 1985).  Cereal rye is largely cross-pollinated; most plants are self sterile (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Maturation date of cereal rye varies according to soil moisture, but vegetative growth stops once reproduction begins (Stoskopf, 1985).  Cereal rye plants are taller than wheat and tiller less; the flag leaf is smaller and less important in photosynthesis (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Based on the account by Gawronska and Nalborczyk (1989), cereal rye has the longest stems of all cultivated small grains, and these provide most of the photosynthetic area.  During grain formation, stems with sheaths account for 60-80% of the total plant area.  At grain set, 15-20% of the photosynthetic area is provided by leaf blades, which is much lower than for maize, wheat, and oat.  Stems and sheaths have lower rates of photosynthesis and export of assimilates than do leaves.  For winter rye, photosynthetic area decreases rapidly after grain set, and does not achieve a plateau near the maximum, as seen with other grains.  These features were consistent across the six cultivars assessed.  Taken together, these factors suggest that winter rye grain formation occurs under unfavorable physiological conditions for yielding.<P> In the autumn, cereal rye grows more rapidly than wheat, oat, or various other annual grasses (Knight, 1985), and it produces more fall and early spring growth than oat (Miller, 1984).  Because it grows better in cooler weather, cereal rye can be incorporated earlier in the spring (McLeod, 1982). Although cereal rye is usually regarded as a winter crop, spring-sown varieties are available (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Cereal rye as a cover crop is grown for erosion control, to add organic matter, to enhance soil life, and for weed suppression (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  It may stabilize and prevent leaching of excess soil or manure nitrogen (Schonbeck, 1988); has an extensive root system that makes it among the best green manures for improving soil structure (Pears et al., 1989); and is a better soil renovator than oat (McLeod, 1982).  Cereal rye is useful for preventing wind or water erosion (Miller, 1984) and has been used to protect soil from wind erosion in Australia (Bushuk, 1976); if disked under, it improves infiltration by irrigation water (Williams, 1966).<P> Cereal rye is normally seeded at 112 kg/ha, but when it is seeded late, the rate should be increased up to 336 kg/ha to achieve rapid and complete vegetational cover and reduce erosion. To minimize erosion, a leaf area index of 1.0 (complete cover) may be necessary (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> No-till hairy vetch preceding corn showed significantly-higher soil organic matter than either rye or fallow (Frye and Blevins, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Cereal rye can become a weed through volunteering (Stoskopf, 1985) and sometimes escapes in waste places and fields in California (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Cereal rye can itself become a weed through volunteering (Stoskopf, 1985), yet it is noted as a good rotational crop because it suppresses weeds (Bushuk , 1976).  In the Northeast, it has been noted for suppressing lambsquarters and pigweed, but not wild mustard (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Rye produces several compounds that inhibit crops and weeds. The most active compounds are two hydroxamic acids and their breakdown products (Chase et al., 1991).  Perez and Ormeno-Nunez (1991) reported that hydroxamic acids are exuded by the roots of growing cereal rye plants and can inhibit root growth of wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B> L.).  Exudates of wheat roots contained no hydroxamic acids and showed no such inhibitory effects.  Residues of tillering plants and rye crop residues contain much lower amounts of allelopathic compounds (various phenolic acids) than do seedlings (Wocjcik-Wojtkowiak et al., 1990).<P> Some suppressive effects of cereal rye may relate to tie-up of soil nitrogen by decomposing rye residues.  If rye is incorporated while under 16 inches in height and the tissue is still sweet to the taste, this sort of tie-up can supposedly be minimized (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Smeda and Putnam (1988) studied cover crops of cereal rye (cv 'Wheeler'), wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.  'Yorkstar') and barley (<I>Hordeum vulgare</I></B> L.  cv 'Barsoy') grown amid 2-year-old stands of strawberry (<I>Frageria X ananassa</I></B> Duchesne Rosaceae; cv 'Midway' or 'Guardian'). There were also control plots with no cover crops seeded.  The cover crops were planted in mid September and killed during early or late May, with applications of the graminicidal herbicide fluazifop-butyl. All cover crops showed better weed suppression than the control, but the only significant differences among cover crops indicated that barley was inferior to rye or winter wheat.  There were no significant differences among treatments in yield of strawberries.<P> Inclusion of barley, oat, or rye in a mix of cover crops along with vetches and bell beans appears to reduce infestation by common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B>) (Bugg, 1990).<P> In plots seeded to 'Merced' cereal rye in Mendocino County, California, above-ground dry biomass of weeds during mid May was 0.031+/-0.031 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which is only 0.63% of the weed biomass in unseeded control plots.  Dominant weeds were annual ryegrass, rattail fescue, common chickweed, and scarlet pimpernel.  Vegetational cover data by the cereal rye was 96.25+/-2.39 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is useful for preventing wind or water erosion (Miller, 1984); if disked under, it improves infiltration by irrigation water (Williams, 1966).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The inflorescences and seed are as follows: Spikelets usually 2-flowered, solitary, placed flatwise against the rachis, the rachilla disarticulating above the glumes and produced beyond the upper floret as minute stipe; glumes narrow, rigid, acuminate or subulate-pointed; lemmas broader, sharply keeled, 5 nerved, ciliate on the keel and exposed margins, tapering into a long awn (Hitchcock, 1971). According to Stoskopf (1985), the lemma and palea that enclose the floret are free-threshing, and the lemma often bears barbs on the keel and often has an awn of intermediate length.  The rye kernel is longer and more slender than that of wheat. Cereal rye seed may germinate in storage or even while still in the ear (Starzycki, 1976).  Seed will germinate at temperatures as low as 3-5 C, but optimal range is 25-31 C (Starzycki, 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Cereal rye has shown good growth in pecan orchards of southern Georgia, but pecan is leafless from mid-November to mid-April (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No specific information was available on salinity tolerance of cereal rye, but this is not typically listed as one of its virtues, by contrast with the situation for barley (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is susceptible to glyphosate (Bugg, pers. comm., Bugg et al., 1991) and to paraquat (Laub and Luna, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed is readily available.  The Southern Seedsmen's Association (1992) listed 28 suppliers of cv 'Elbon' and 19 of cv 'Wrens Abruzzi.'<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Rye is a long-day plant: flowering is induced by 14 hours of daylight when this is accompanied by temperatures of 5-10 C (55-65 F) (Stoskopf, 1985). According to Stoskopf's (1985) review, shortened daylength can cause rye plants to remain vegetative for up to seven years.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Worldwide mean grain production in 1972 was about 1.77 Mg/ha (Bushuk, 1976)<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Cereal rye grows rapidly and vigorously during fall and spring, and performs well under cold conditions and with poor soil (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Cereal rye may be grazed or mowed in late fall without diminishing the grain yield (Starzycki, 1976). In late April or early May in North Carolina, mowing with a rotary mower can be used to kill cereal rye (cv 'Abruzzi') (Laub and Luna, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Grain of cereal rye can be harvested like wheat (presumably with combines), but the large amount of straw makes harvest less efficent (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>In late April or early May in North Carolina, mowing with a rotary mower (bush hog) can be used to kill cereal rye (cv 'Abruzzi') (Laub and Luna, 1991).<P> Grain of cereal rye can be harvested like wheat (presumably with combines) (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Thorough incorporation of rye cover is essential to prevent regrowth of cereal rye cover crops (Richard Smith, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No specific information on cereal rye effects on workers is available.  Cereal rye, with its tall stature, might be expected to inhibit foot traffic in cover cropped fields or orchards (Bugg, pers. comm.).  It can interfere with sprinkler irrigation by blocking the emitters (George Kresa, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Starzycki (1976) wrote that cereal rye may be attacked by <I>Ditylenchus dipsaci</I></B> Kuehn, <I>Anguina tritici</I></B> (Steinbuch), and <I>Heterodera avenae</I></B>.  Carrot, wheat, potato, turnip, lupin, serradella, sainfoin, alfalfa, and white mustard can be grown preceding cereal rye to reduce <I>D. dipsaci</I></B>. Clean seed and crop rotation reduces <I>A. tritici</I></B>.  Use of leguminous and root crops in rotation reduces <I>H. avenae</I></B>.<P> On a sandy soil in Florida, McSorley and Dickson (1989) found that cereal rye as a cover crop led to increased densities of <I>Belonolaimus longicaudatus</I></B>; for 5 other plant-parasitic nematodes assessed, cover cropping led to mainenance or a slight decline in pre-existing densities.<P> Cereal rye harbored particularly low densities of root lesion nematode (<I>Pratylynchus penetrans</I></B>) in an orchard in Ontario, Canada (Marks and Townsend, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Starzycki (1976) reported that cereal rye is afflicted by the following fungi: powdery mildew (<I>Erysiphe graminis</I></B> DC), ergot of rye (<I>Claviceps purpurea</I></B> (Fr.) Tul., take-all of wheat (<I>Gaeumannomyces graminis</I></B> Arx et Olivier - - <I>Opiobolus graminis</I></B> Sacc.), stalk smut (<I>Urocystis occulta</I></B> [Wallr.] Rab.), stem rust (<I>Puccinia graminis</I></B> Pers., f. <I>secalis</I></B>), brown leaf rust (<I>Puccinia dispersa</I></B> Erikss.) yellow rust (<I>Puccinia striformis</I></B> West - - <I>Puccinia glumarum</I></B> Erikss et Henn.), eyespot (<I>Cercosporella herpotrichoides</I></B> Fron.), snow mold (<I>Fusarium nivale</I></B> (Fr.) Ces.), fusariosis of rye spikes (<I>Fusarium</I></B> spp.), spot blotch (<I>Helminthosporium sativum</I></B> [Pam] King et Bakke [Bipolaris sorokiniana {Sacc. in Sorok} Shoemaker]), black mold (<I>Cladosporium herbarium</I></B> [Pers.]), Antracnose (<I>Colletotrichum graminicola</I></B> [Ces.] Wils.), septoria leaf blotch (<I>Septoria secalis</I></B> [Rob.]), and leaf blotch of rye (<I>Rhynchosporium secalis</I></B> [Oudem.] I.I. Davies). Viral diseases of cereal rye include barley yellow dwarf, wheat dwarf, soil-borne mosaic, and oat blue dwarf (Starzycki, 1976)<P>

<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Cereal rye can serve as grain, hay, pasture, cover crop and green manure (McLeod, 1982).  It is a good pioneer crop for sterile soils (Bushuk, 1976). When used as a cover crop, it is grown for erosion control, to add organic matter, to enhance soil life, and for weed suppression (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983). It may also stabilize and prevent leaching of excess soil or manure nitrogen (Schonbeck, 1988).  Cereal rye is useful for preventing wind or water erosion (Miller, 1984); it has been used to protect soil from wind erosion in Australia (Bushuk, 1976) and, with its tall stature, may be of some value in providing windbreaks (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Cereal rye is a good green manure because it produces large quantities of organic matter but should be used only in rotation with row crops because other grain crops are graded down in the market if they contain rye seed (McLeod, 1982).  On the other hand, it can inhibit germination or growth of vegetable crops sown after rye is incorporated (Schonbeck, 1988).  Winter cover crops of rye are often seen (Gershuny and Smillie, 1986), and it has performed well when overseeded into field corn, sweet corn, or brassica crops in the Northeast (Schonbeck, 1988) and in pecan orchards in southern Georgia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is one of the best cover crops where fertility is low and winter temperatures are extreme (McLeod, 1982); it has a low requirment for lime (McLeod, 1982); and can outyield other cereals on droughty, sandy, infertile soils (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Cereal rye produces large amounts of organic matter (McLeod, 1982); in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, cv 'Merced' produced an above-ground dry biomass of 9.910+/-1.775 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  This was less than 'U.C.475' barley or 'California Red' oat (but not significantly less), despite Miller's (1984) statement that oat does not produce as much dry matter as barley, rye, or wheat.  Biomass yields are not always great: in a three year field trial in Georgia, cereal rye biomass averaged only 4.03 Mg/ha (Hargrove. 1986), and Brinton (1989) mentioned only 1,100-1,300 lb/a of dry biomass.  Per-plant biomass ranges from 25.8 ('Viatka') to 35.1 g ('Dankowske Zlote'), according to Gawronska and Nalborczyk (1989).  Cereal rye produces more fall and early spring growth than oat (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is grown in the cool temperate zones or at high altitudes (Bushuk, 1976).  It is the most winter hardy of all small cereal grains (Miller, 1984; Stoskopf, 1985) enduring all but the most severe climates (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  Its cold tolerance exceeds that of wheat, including the most hardy winter wheat varieties (Stoskopf, 1985), and it is seldom injured by cold weather (McLeod, 1982).  Starzycki (1976) stated that 3-5 degrees C or higher is required to germinate, with the optimal range being 25-31 degrees.<P> In the Northeast, it can be established when seeded as late as October 1 (Schonbeck, 1988).  Minimal temperatures for germinating cereal rye seed have been variously given as 3 to 5, 0.6, and 1 to 2 degrees C; optimal range has been given as 25 to 31 and 13 to 18 degrees C.  According to Stoskopf (1985), for vegetative growth to occur, a minimumum temperature of 4 degrees C is required.  Once well established, cereal rye can withstand temperatures as low as -35 degrees C (-31 degrees F).  The structure of the rye plant enables it to capture and hold protective snow cover, which enhances winter-hardiness.  Cereal rye is a long-day plant and flowering is induced by 14 hours of daylight accompanied by temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees C (Stoskopf, 1985).<P> Because it grows better in cooler weather, cereal rye can be incorporated earlier in the spring (McLeod, 1982).  In summary, cereal rye is one of the best crops where fertility is low and winter temperatures are extreme (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Cereal rye is thought to be native to the mountains of southwestern Asia (Hitchcock, 1971; Munz, 1973) and to have been derived from <I>Secale montanum</I></B> Guss., a perennial grass native to that area (Hitchcock, 1971).  Cereal rye has a wide range of adaptability; no other winter cereal can be grown as far north (McLeod, 1982).  It shows the widest geographic distribution of all cereal crops (Bushuk, 1976): production is possible throughout the temperate and subtropical zones, within the Arctic Circle, and in southern Chile.  In the Himalayan mountains, cereal rye can be grown at 4,300 m (14,400 ft) elevation (Stoskopf, 1985).  Its wide range of adaptation is due to its great winter hardiness and tolerance of marginal soils: it can be grown in soils too acidic for wheat (Stoskopf, 1985).  Evans and Scoles (1976) said that the extensive root system of cereal rye enables it to be the most drought-tolerant cereal crop, and its maturation date can alter based on moisture availability.  Cereal rye is more drought tolerant than oat (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>According to McLeod (1982), cereal rye grows best on well drained loam or clay loam soils, but even heavy clays, light sands, and infertile or poorly drained soils are feasible.  It will grow on soils too poor to produce other grains or clover (McLeod, 1982). In general, it is tolerant of different soil types (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983; Miller, 1984); does well on loamy or sandy soil (Brinton, 1989); will give good yields on poor, sandy soils (Bushuk, 1976.); and does better than oat on sandy soil (Miller, 1984).  Cereal rye can outyield other cereals on droughty, sandy, infertile soils (Stoskopf, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Suggested seeding rates are: 60 to 90 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989); 90-112 kg/ha (80-100 lb/a) (Miller, 1984); 90 to 160 lb/acre for green manure (McLeod, 1982); 112 lbs/acre (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983); 120-200 lb/a (Brinton, 1989.); and 56 lbs/acre when sown with clover (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  According to Stoskopf (1985), cereal rye is normally seeded at 112 kg/ha but when seeded late the rate should be increased up to 336 kg/ha to achieve rapid and complete vegetational cover and reduce erosion; to minimize erosion, a leaf area index of 1.0 [complete cover] may be necessary.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding depths include: 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982); 1 inch (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983); 0.4 to 1.2 inches (Brinton, 1989); and 2.5 to 5.0 cm (1-2 in.) (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982), but seed may germinate in storage (Bushuk, 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>The common name is rye (Hitchcock, 1971; Munz, 1973; McLeod, 1982) or cereal rye (McLeod, 1982).  The use of the latter name reduces confusion with ryegrasses (<I>Lolium</I></B> spp.).<P>

This book addresses the important relationship between biological
diversity and agricultural production. When we hear the term biodiversity,
many of us think of the highly publicized decline in certain species
of plants and larger mammals. This book builds a case for turning
our attention to changes taking place in the much more numerous
invertebrates and microorganisms. In fact, a decline in these
less visible species could have far-reaching effects on the sustainability
of many agricultural production systems around the world. The
reason the impact could be so great is that invertebrates and
microorganisms play a vital role in maintaining and enhancing
soil fertility, detoxifying pesticides and other pollutants, and
in biological control of agricultural pests.  <BR>

<P>
The book is based on a workshop organized by C.A.B. International
in association with the Committee on the Application of Science
to Agriculture, Forestry and Aquaculture, the Commonwealth Science
Council, and the Third World Academy of Sciences. Twenty-one chapters
are organized into four main subject areas: the importance of
invertebrates and microorganisms as components of biodiversity;
the importance of biodiversity in sustainable soil productivity;
the importance of biodiversity to pest occurrence and management;
and biotechnology and biodiversity among invertebrates and microorganisms.
 <BR>

<P>
Among the key findings of the workshop are the following:  <BR>

<P>
1. We need to increase our knowledge of the nature, extent, and
potential usefulness of the genetic resources present in microorganisms
and invertebrates and how to protect different ecosystems as reservoirs
of such biodiversity.  <BR>

<P>
2. To do so will require that:  <BR>

<P>
(a) Research is undertaken to describe the diversity, gene pool,
and ecological interactions of different organisms in agricultural
and natural systems;  <BR>

<P>
(b) Existing genetic potential in invertebrates and microorganisms
is conserved by the preservation of natural and managed systems,
and, where necessary, by maintaining culture collections of organisms
of current and potential value.  <BR>

<P>
3. The promotion of biodiversity alone will not eliminate the
need for improvements in farming skills and management. It will,
however, contribute to the development of diverse systems able
to sustain production on both marginal lands (albeit at low levels)
as well as in more fertile areas.  <BR>

<P>
4. The need to support effective conservation and utilization
of biodiversity requires development of skills in biosystematics
and related disciplines worldwide.  <BR>

<P>
5. The benefits of maintaining biological diversity should be
more clearly communicated. Maintaining the diversity of invertebrates
and microorganisms has importance for agriculture and other aspects
of human welfare. Soil organisms, for example; have been used
to produce antibiotics.  <BR>

<P>
6. Education and training must reflect the need to increase awareness
of the significance of biodiversity in agriculture and the environment,
including the problems of protecting ecologically vulnerable areas.

<H1>&quot;How to&quot; monitor rangeland resources.
</H1>

<P>
<I>University of California Intermountain Workgroup</I>
<P>
University of California, Cooperative Extension, Division of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, Oakland, CA. 1994<BR>

<P>
Analysis and debate at the national and regional level point to
the need for accurate and consistent methods of assessing the
sustainability of rangeland ecosystems. One essential tool for
accomplishing this task is rangeland monitoring. Monitoring is
the systematic recording of observations, processes, or activities
to detect how rangeland changes over time. Monitoring methods
vary in their complexity, but all are focused on assessing the
productivity and stability of the resource base.
<P>
This &quot;how to&quot; manual is a step-by-step guide for developing
and implementing a ranch monitoring program. It was written and
produced by a team of natural resources advisors from University
of California Cooperative Extension. These include Glenn Nader
(Lassen County), Mike DeLasaux (Plumas-Sierra counties), Rick
Delmas (Modoc County), Dan Drake (Siskiyou County), Larry Forero
(Shasta-Trinity counties), Sheila Barry (Tehama County), Holly
George (Plumas-Sierra counties), and Rhonda Gildersleeve (Inyo-Mono
counties).
<P>
According to the authors of this handbook, monitoring is useful
for: 1) determining the effectiveness of management practices;
2) establishing a record of range conditions documenting the effect
of livestock grazing on key areas; 3) measuring a trend toward
a desired condition; and 4) defending grazing practices.
<P>
The handbook is divided into two levels. Level 1-Beginning, introduces
the concepts needed to start a ranch monitoring program. It describes
why monitoring is important and how it can be used in different
situations, and covers some basic methods of monitoring and organizing
information. Specifically, the authors focus on how to use information
from historical documents, US Geological Survey Maps, and aerial
photographs; how to monitor and keep records with a camera; and
how to supplement photographic information with more detailed
observations.
<P>
Level 2-Advanced, offers more detailed guidelines for monitoring
vegetative cover and for mapping forage conditions on the range.
In addition, the advanced level looks at special applications
for rangeland monitoring including riparian monitoring, water
quality and fisheries, and monitoring wildlife.
<P>
One section of the handbook profiles the monitoring practices
of an Inyo county rancher. In that profile, he offers a rancher's
perspective on the usefulness of monitoring. &quot;The point of
monitoring should not be just to convince someone else of your
management, but also as a document of changes over time. You,
as the rancher, need to fine-tune your own observations and decisions
for the land. Statistical concerns and techniques that the agencies
use are really not very useful to ranchers-annual pictures of
country you are familiar with can give you a lot of information
to help you understand your land. A rancher's lifetime of observations,
even though it can't be quantified, is still the best way to know
the land. Taking pictures just makes the observations more acute,
and documents what you already know. Do not be intimidated that
there is a lot to know, just start on a simple level and get out
there and do it every year. You will learn as you do it, and refine
your techniques as you need to.&quot;

<P>
The UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR) has
focused new attention on cover cropping by forming a systemwide
Cover Crops Workgroup, Its purpose is to bring together Cooperative
Extension farm advisors and specialists, faculty and others to
share  information,  determine the highest priority research and
extension needs, and coordinate activities to fulfill these needs.
<B>Chuck Ingels</B>, SAREP perennial cropping systems analyst,
chairs the workgroup, which includes 68 DANR personnel. <BR>

<P>
The first workgroup meeting was at UC Davis in May and was attended
by 55 people. Twenty researchers presented information on their
continuing research projects in annual and perennial cropping
systems. The reports covered a broad range of topics including
plant nutrition, water infiltration, pest management, cover cropping
systems and management, and education. <BR>

<P>
&quot;The meeting demonstrated that University researchers are
clearly addressing critical research needs related to cover cropping
and sustainable agriculture, but many questions remain unanswered,&quot;
said Ingels. <BR>

<P>
In addition to the reports, the speakers prepared abstracts of
their research; SAREP is now making these abstracts available
to the public. To receive a copy of the 20-page collection, send
$5 (checks payable to UC Regents) to: SAREP (CC Workgroup), University
of California, Davis, CA 95616. To receive the abstracts free
through . electronic mail or for questions, contact Chuck Ingels,
Information Group-SAREP, University of California, Davis,) CA
95616; tel: (916) 757-3276; fax :(916)757-3281; e-mail: caingels@ucdavis.edu.

Project Description</A></H3>

The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and quantify the 
environmental and economic consequences of the transition from conventional to low-
input and organic farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento Valley.  The 
research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC farm advisors 
play a key role in guiding the management decisions applied to the various production 
systems.  The project was initiated in 1989 and is located on the UC Davis Agronomy 
Farm.

The main experiment occupies about 20 acres and compares four cropping systems:
 
<OL>
	<LI> a conventional two-year rotation; 
	<LI> a conventional four-year rotation; 
	<LI> a low-input four-year rotation; and 
	<LI> an organic four-year rotation.  
</OL>

The four systems are 
arranged in plots with four replicates of each system.  All the cropping systems 
include processing tomatoes, a high-value commodity grown on approximately 310,000 
acres in California (1990 data).  Other cash crops grown include wheat, safflower, 
field corn, and beans.  In addition, winter-spring cover crops are grown in the low-
input and organic systems.  The specific rotations used in the different management 
systems are shown below. <P>

</PRE>

** Cover crops used have included vetch, oats, and cowpeas, solely or in mixtures.  Other species 
are currently being evaluated. <P>


Both conventional systems are managed using practices typical for the southern 
Sacramento Valley.  The two-year conventional system is practiced by farmers when 
short-term profit must be maximized.  The low-input system includes a winter 
cover crop prior to planting of tomatoes, safflower, corn, and beans.  While trying 
to reduce dependency on non-renewable resources, synthetic fertilizers or pesticides 
may be used in the low-input system to maintain the profitability of the operation.  
The organic system is managed according to the certification requirements of 
California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).  Only approved fertilizers and 
pesticides are used.  "Best farmer" management practices are used in all systems.  
For example, insect and disease management decisions for all systems are based on 
periodic monitoring of pest levels and no pesticides are applied until economic 
threshold levels are exceeded.<P>

A companion research area of eight acres is being used to test alternative grain and 
cover crop legumes that could be used as cash crops, as winter and summer cover 
crops, or in intercropping systems in California.  Along with this effort, 
investigators are evaluating various kinds of agricultural equipment for use in 
reduced tillage operations and innovative cover crop management. <P>

Data collected during the first four years of the experiment include 
measurements of:  crop growth, yield, and quality; soil biology; soil 
fertility; soil organic matter levels; soil water infiltration rates; weed 
biomass; disease levels; pest and beneficial insect populations; and economic 
performance.  From these data, researchers have been able to make preliminary 
observations about the performance of the various cropping systems.<P>
     
Soil fertility and weed management have been identified as the most important 
factors limiting yields in the organic and low-input systems.  Researchers 
have altered production practices to address these constraints.  Organic and 
low-input tomatoes, for example, are now transplanted instead of direct-
seeded.  This practice gives tomatoes a head start in competing against weeds 
and allows for the use of more efficient mechanical cultivation techniques.  
Supplemental manure fertilizers have also improved yields in the organic and 
low-input systems.<P>

Other problems thus far have not been a major constraint for any of the 
production systems.  However, the soil-borne pathogen Verticillium dahliae has 
been consistently higher in the conventional two-year system than in the 
others.  Researchers will be collecting additional data to determine whether 
the disease organism will actually decrease tomato yields in this
rotation.  <P>

Organic matter added through cover cropping and manuring has resulted in small 
increases in soil organic matter levels in the organic and low-input plots.  
This increase seems to be improving soil physical structure as shown by trends 
toward increased water infiltration rates.  <P>

Preliminary results suggest that similar crop yields may be obtained when 
"best farmer" management practices are used in each of the different systems.  
Similar yields, however, do not necessarily translate into similar profits.  
Year-to-year variations in production costs for each system, and the modest 
price premiums offered for organically-grown commodities should also be 
considered.  During the 1991 growing season, for example, gross returns, per 
acre operating costs, and net returns above total costs were all highest in 
the conventional two-year rotation (all crops combined).  The 1992 season, by 
contrast, showed that the organic system had the highest figures in each of 
these same categories.  Results of this study support what other studies have 
found:  The transition period (as evidenced by the performance of the low-
input system) carries significant risk. There are no price premiums for 
"transitional commodities," costs of production may be high, growers are 
generally on the steep part of the learning curve, and the new production 
system can be ecologically unstable for a time.  Recommendations for 
minimizing this risk are a key objective as experimentation and analysis 
continue. <P>

Differences between the four cropping systems and the relationships among 
various parameters observed during the first four years of the experiment have 
suggested a number of more specific research questions to pursue.  These are 
listed below under the general headings of soil, pests, and economics:  


<H4>SOIL</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>	How do seasonal changes in nitrogen availability differ among the
various farming systems?   
  <LI>	What is the role of microbial biomass in regulating seasonal nitrate pool levels?
  <LI>	How do microbivorous nematodes affect nutrient cycling?
  <LI>	Can soil microbial parameters be used as indices of soil health?  
  <LI>	How will differences in soil organic matter levels and water infiltration rates affect the volume of 
soil explored by roots and the 
water balance of crops?
</UL>

<H4>PESTS</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>	Will soil-borne pathogens limit yields of tomatoes under the intensive 
two-year tomato-wheat rotation?
  <LI>	What levels of weed pressure can be tolerated in the different systems 
without loss of yield?
</UL>

<H4>ECONOMICS</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>	How do the costs of cover cropping and manuring compare to those of 
applying chemical fertilizer?
  <LI>	What are the cost differences and relative efficacy of conventional and 
alternative weed management strategies?

<I>Jill Auburn, SAREP &amp; Lynne Kennedy, UC Agricultural Issues
Center<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B>  <I>Six growers, three pest control advisers,
an agricultural chemical representative, and a bank loan officer
met with UC Biocontrol Specialist<B> </B></I><B>Kent</B> <B>Daane
</B><I>at Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier recently to discuss
their experiences in moving toward more biologically-based pest
management methods.  The meeting was organized by<B> </B></I><B>Lynne
Kennedy</B> <I>of UC's Agricultural Issues Center (AIC) to provide
information for a publication on biological approaches to pest
management coordinated by the AIC. The publication, coordinated
by<B> </B></I><B>Patrick</B> <B>Madden</B> <I>and several study
teams of UC research and extension staff is planned for Spring
1991 release to policy-makers and other interested readers.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Q:<I> </I>Is information on biological pest management available
and affordable?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A: (Paraphrased participant responses)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Some information is available, but a lot more research needs to
be done, particularly in foreign exploration/importation of natural
enemies, and understanding life cycles of pests and beneficials.
 There is a lag time between when the problem arises and when
the answers become available.  We stop researching an insect when
the problem goes away, so we don't learn everything we should.
 Usually research that is done doesn't apply to a grower's exact
situation, so there is still a need for growers and their pest
control advisers (PCAs) to work out their own methodologies. 
Growers get ideas and intermediate results at update meetings,
but express some trouble getting conclusive end results of research.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Q:<I> </I>We have consensus that existing information is incomplete,
but how do we make what does exist more available?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Monthly meetings of farmers, PCAs and farm advisors
are useful.  Farm advisors can't come out and diagnose problems
quickly; we need more people who can do this.  The private sector,
state universities, retired experienced farmers all might help.
 Bold farmers who experiment are a good source of information:
 They may do things for the wrong reasons, but they often work.
 Not everything has to be understood scientifically in order to
work.<BR>
<P>
<B>Q: What are the risks as you move away from pesticides?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Cosmetic damage, such as light scarring of the rind
on melons and oranges, or russeting on plums, will usually be
rejected, even if no pesticides were used on the product.  Early-maturing
varieties of stone fruits hold up well, but later varieties do
not without conventional fungicides.  Biological sprays such as
the bacteria &quot;Bt&quot; may have to be used very frequently,
whereas the real goal is a stable system that doesn't need frequent
intervention.  Transitional and organic farms are more management-intensive.
 Additionally, infestations from neighbors can upset the system.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Q: Aren't there several costs involved in a transition?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A:</B> In crops like cotton, almonds, corn, alfalfa, it actually
becomes cheaper and easier to farm using biological approaches.
 For other crops, such as fruits, the transition is more costly.
 Integrated pest management (IPM) definitely drops costs, but
going completely organic may raise them.<BR>
<P>
<B>Q: What are some of the greatest problems?<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Education and attitudes of growers, marketers and consumers.
 Centralized and industrialized approach to food production and
marketing.  Increased monitoring and consulting needed.  Not enough
research being done.  Costs, supply and effectiveness of botanicals.
 Re-establishing natural enemies.  Uncertainty:  Will the transition
work?  Will consumers pay for it, and accept trade-offs?   Will
it be profitable?  There's a premium for organic produce, but
no premium for something that's &quot;pretty safe&quot; but the
grower had to use one pesticide at one point. The incentive has
to be there for growers to switch.<BR>

Conditions were alkaline along the remainder of the root systems.  Concentrations of citric and malic acids were generally lower for plants grown with sufficient phosphorus.

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In an effort to determine how &quot;sustainable&quot; are western
Oregon and Washington farmers, the authors of this paper conducted
two telephone interviews of over 300 growers of potatoes, broccoli,
sweet corn, raspberries, and strawberries. Numerous sources were
used to identify the growers, who represented a wide range of
farm sizes.<BR>

<P>
Initially, a single sustainability scale was to be used for the
interviews, but it was determined that the variables separated
into two distinct scales. The Input Change Scale was used to identify
the changes in the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides
in the past five years. The Production Practices Scale assessed
farmers' use of alternative production practices, including: integration
of livestock in the farming operation, type of tillage, use of
rotations, nitrogen budgeting, sources of nitrogen, nonchemical
methods of pest control, and methods used to control erosion.
The Production Practices Scale also examined farm characteristics,
family structure, and participation in farm work, community involvement,
and purchasing patterns.<BR>

<P>
The authors note that the two scales are not correlated with each
other. That is, producers in this region who were reducing input
use have different characteristics from those who were adopting
a variety of alternative production practices.<BR>

<P>
According to the Input Change Scale, producers using fewer agricultural
chemicals farmed fewer acres and had a higher percentage of family
income earned off the farm than those whose use of chemicals had
increased. The decreased chemical input group also had fewer employees,
less investment in machinery, and lower incomes than the increased
input group. Finally, the decreased chemical input group sold
more produce at fresh market and bought slightly more inputs from
local sources.<BR>

<P>
In contrast to the Input Change Scale, the Production Practices
Scale indicated that growers having greater use of alternative
production practices had larger farms, greater investments in
machinery, and somewhat higher incomes than those using fewer
alternative practices. Family members on the farms with higher
levels of alternative practices were less likely to work off the
farm, and the percentage of family income earned off the farm
was lower.<BR>

<P>
The authors compared the influence of farm size and principal
occupation of the operator on input use and production practice
decisions. Similar trends were found for these variables:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Full-time and large-scale producers (360 acres or more) were
far more likely to increase their use of chemical fertilizers
and pesticides than part-time and small-scale farmers (39 acres
or less);
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Part-time and small-scale producers used limited primary tillage
and noncommercial nitrogen sources more than large-scale and full-time
producers who used cultivation or rotation for most weed control,
nitrogen budgeting, and various ecological cropping and rotation
patterns.
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
This research highlights the difficulties involved in characterizing
the &quot;sustainability&quot; of a set of agricultural producers.
It also points out the strong influence of structural factors
such as farm size and the principal occupation of the farmer on
the practices farmers use. According to the authors, the results
of the study seem reasonable because small-scale producers can
more easily reduce chemical use by substituting labor (e.g., hand-weeding)
for chemicals; large-scale producers, on the other hand, usually
have more resources (e.g., land and money) to test and use alternative
practices.<BR>

<P>
Though for a limited set of horticultural producers, this research
lends support to the argument that &quot;policies for moving farmers
in the direction of using more sustainable practices should take
into account the structural factors that influence the adoption
of such practices.&quot;<BR>

<H1>Hopland Pasture Management Meeting<BR>
</H1>
<P>
New developments in pasture management were presented to an overflow
audience of ranchers at UC's Hopland Field Station October 21.
The meeting was co-sponsored by Mendocino County Cooperative Extension
and the Mendocino County Farm Bureau.<BR>
<H3>Improvements Save $</H3>
<P>
Sonoma County Farm Advisor <B>Stephanie Larson</B> demonstrated
that &quot;spending money to make money&quot; by improving pasture
through seeding, and fertilizing with phosphorus and possibly
sulfur can be more cost-effective than buying hay.<BR>
<P>
Hopland agronomist<B> Milt Jones</B> emphasized the importance
of using freshly inoculated seed when planting a legume such as
a clover.<BR>
<H3>Controlled Grazing</H3>
<P>
Several presentations focused on controlled grazing, a management
technique that limits the length of time fields are grazed, allowing
time for pasture to recover. Conventional grazing methods allow
animals to graze continuously throughout fields. Controlled grazing
requires planning, flexibility, and a holistic view of the ranch,
according to <B>Dave Pratt</B>, Napa and Solano counties farm
advisor.<BR>
<P>
Milt Jones presented preliminary results from the first year of
a study funded by UC SAREP at Hopland comparing controlled and
continuous grazing. Pratt and Larson demonstrated training sheep
to electric fencing.<BR>
<H3>Plant, Animal Pests</H3>
<P>
Mendocino County Farm Advisor <B>Glenn McGourty</B> reviewed the
successes and failures in biological control of weeds. &quot;Biocontrol
will usually not eradicate weeds, but may keep them at low levels,&quot;
he said. Other tools are usually still needed, he added.<BR>
<P>
Controlling vertebrate pests is a constant challenge, as described
by Hopland Superintendent <B>Bob Timm</B>, who has experimented
with several breeds of guard dogs in the last two years with wildly
varying results.<BR>
<P>
Hopland is one of nine University of California agricultural field
stations and centers located throughout the state. They include
Deciduous Fruit Field Station in San Jose, Imperial Valley Agricultural
Center in El Centro, Kearney Agricultural Center in Parlier, Lindcove
Field Station in Exeter, Sierra Foothill Range Field Station in
Browns Valley, South Coast Field Station in Irvine, Tulelake Field
Station in Tulelake, and West Side Field Station in Five Points.

<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described hairy vetch as a straggling, climbing, prostrate, or trailing annual, biennial, or perennial herb.  Madson (1951) stated that the species produces coarse viny vegetation of moderate to heavy density.  It seldom attains a height of more than 3 or 4 feet except when supported by oat or some other companion crop (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described hairy vetch as a straggling, climbing, prostrate or trailing annual, biennial, or perennial herb.  In California, Munz (1973) stated that this species behaves as an annual or biennial.  The herbage including the leaves and stem can be hairy or smooth.  Flowers are blue and are borne in loose racemes, inflorescences borne on long stems or peduncles.  Leaves are compound, made up of several pairs of leaflets; there is no terminal leaflet (Madson, 1951).<P> A description by Hermann (1960) indicates that stems are spreading-villous, up to a meter long; leaflets usually 10 to 20, narrowly oblong to linear-lanceolate, obtuse and mucronate to acute, 1 to 2.5 cm.  long; peduncles elongate; racemes dense, 10- to 40- flowered, secund, plumose in bud; flowers 12 to 20 mm. long; calyx irregular, villous, the tube 2.3 to 4 mm. long, gibbous at the base on the upper side, the pedicel apparently inserted ventrally, the lower teeth linear-acicular, long-villous, 2 to 5 mm. long, the upper linear-triangular 0.8 to 1.5 mm. long; corolla violet and white to rose colored or white, slender, the blade of the glabrous standard less than half as long as the claw; pod oblong, 2 to 3 cm.  long, 7 to 10 mm. broad, obliquely beaked.<P> According to Goar (1934), stems often reach 12 feet in length. Its viny habit prevents it from being more than 3 or 4 feet tall unless grown with oat or some other supporting crop.  From 9 to 17 pairs of narrow leaflets constitute the leaf, which is determinated by a tendril.  Twenty to thirty blue-violet flowers are borne on one side of a long flower stem.  The stems and leaves have many long hairs.<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Due to its winter and early spring dormancy, hairy vetch was deemed by Madson (1951) unsatisfactory where covercrop must be plowed in early.  If incorporation can be delayed until early May, it produces good biomass.<P> The same rules apply in incorporating hairy vetch as with other vetches.  Mowing prior to discing can aid in incorporating and prevent light-weight tillage implements from being entangled by the viny vetch (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In a replicated trial recounted by House (1989), corn was grown following no-till or conventionally-tilled winter cover crops of hairy vetch, crimson clover, or wheat.  Hairy vetch harbored a more abundant and diverse below-ground arthropod fauna (herbivores and predators) than did crimson clover or wheat.  Elateridae, Curculionidae, and Carabidae were particularly abundant following no-till hairy vetch.  Scarabaeidae were especially abundant following conventionally-tilled clover.  Elateridae (wireworms) were the dominant herbivores in no-till systems.  Observed faunal differences had dissipated by July.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Due to cold dormancy, hairy vetch is not suitable for early incorporation.  If allowed to grow until May, it will frequently outyield other varieties (Madson, 1951).  Dry matter yields (Mg/ha) obtained in individual studies with hairy vetch were given as: 4.2, 3.8, 4.2, 2.7, 2.7 (Smith et al., 1987.).  Dry matter yield was measured by Hargrove (1982) as 2.4 tons/acre (5.38 Mg/ha) but may range as high as 6.00-7.00 Mg/ha, with the mean dry wt. of three-year field trial in Georgia being 4.25 Mg/ha.  (Hargrove, 1986).<P> Hofstetter (1988) reported that biomass ranges from 2,000 lb/acre dry matter 60 days after breaking dormancy to 5,000 lb/acre dry matter 90 days after breaking dormancy and that, after overseeding into soybeans, dry matter yield was 1,464 lb/acre.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seedbed should be firm.  On dry-farmed, summer-fallowed land, soil should be tilled lightly after the first rains in the fall to destroy the first flush of weeds and prepare the seed bed.  Where rainfall is late, pre-irrigation about October 1 can be followed by disking or spring-tooth harrowing and rolling, floating to smooth the surface, and vetch can be sown by October 15 (Goar, 1934).<P> Goar (1934) recommended drilling over other methods because it distributes the seeds more evenly and places them at a more uniform depth in the soil, resulting in better germination and stands.  If no grain drill is available, the seed may be broadcast.<P> Madson (1951) stated that, following pre-irrigation, seed should by drilled deep enough to contact moist soil.  Depth can be 2 inches, but late seedings should be closer to the surface.<P> When overseeding into corn, seed 40 lb/acre at last cultivation on freshly-disturbed soil, not before cultivation (Hofstetter, 1988).<P> When seeding following small grains, light soil preparation is needed, with a seeding rate of 25-30 lb/acre (Hofstetter, 1988).<P> Scott and Burt (1985) reported trials in New York state, wherein various cover crops evaluated after overseeding into corn 6-18" high.  Cover crops considered were medium red clover, mammoth red clover, alfalfa, yellow sweetclover, alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, Canada field peas, Austrian winter peas, cowpeas, perennial or annual ryegrass, medium red clover + ryegrass, or medium red clover + rye.  Of these, alfalfa, medium red clover, yellow sweetclover, hairy vetch, ryegrass, and medium red clover + ryegrass performed well.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds globose, 3 to 4.5 mm. in diameter, black, the hilum encircling 1/7 of the circumference (Hermann, 1960),<P> According to Goar (1934), seeds are small, spherical, nearly black, and very irregular in size.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> is recorded as hosting 30 species of plant-parasitic nematodes, including <I>Belonolaimus</I></B> spp., <I>Criconemoides</I></B> spp., <I>Ditylenchus dipsaci</I></B> <I>Heterodera</I></B> spp., <I>Hoplolaimus galeatus</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne hapla</I></B>, <I>M.  incognita acrita</I></B>, <I>M. javanica</I></B>, <I>Paratylenchus</I></B> spp., <I>Pratylenchus</I></B> spp., <I>Rotylenchulus</I></B> spp., <I>Scutellonema brachyurum</I></B>, <I>Trichodorus christiei</I></B>, <I>Tylenchorhynchus claytoni</I></B>, and <I>Xiphinema americanum</I></B>.<P> Nematologists in the southeastern U.S.  use hairy vetch to build up <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B> (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P> Ball and Gray (1980) stated that hairy vetch is susceptible to root-knot nematodes (<I>Meloidogyne spp.</I></B>) and that its use can result in buildup of these pest and yield losses to following susceptible summer row crops.<P> McSorley and Dickson (1989) grew cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>) and hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B>) as cool-season cover crops in monocultural plots on a sandy soil in Florida, to determine effects on nematode population densities over two years.  In early April of each year, cover crops were mowed and disced and then planted to soybean (<I>Glycine max</I></B> [L.] Merr.). Plant- parasitic nematodes assessed included <I>Belonolaimus longicaudatus</I></B> Rau, <I>Meloidogyne ingognita</I></B> (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, <I>Pratylenchus brachyurus</I></B> (Godfrey) Filipjev & Schuurmans Stekhoven, <I>Criconemella sphaerocephala</I></B> (Taylor) Luc & Raski, <I>Paratrichodorus minor</I></B> (Colbran) Siddiqi, and a <I>Xiphinema</I></B> sp.  (possibly <I>X.  floridae</I></B> Lamberti & Bleve-Zacheo).  The design of the experiment did not permit comparison of rye to hairy vetch.  In most instances, cover cropping for 3 or 5 months resulted in maintenance of, or slight decline from, pre-existing nematode densities. Growth of rye resulted in increased densities of <I>B.  longicaudatus</I></B>.<P> In Florida, Gallaher et al.  (1988) tested hairy vetch and four vetch cultivars derived from hybridization with common vetch ('Vantage', 'Cahaba White', 'Vanguard', and 'Nova II') using tillage and no-till regimes preceding corn or sorghum.  The soil type was sandy loam.  Densities of <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B> were much higher on hairy vetch than on any of the vetches derived from common vetch.  <I>Criconemella ornata</I></B> attained relatively-high densities on 'Vantage', 'Cahaba White', and 'Vanguard'. <I>Pratylenchus brachyurus</I></B> and <I>Paratrichodorus minor</I></B> attained statistically-similar densities on all five vetches. <I>Paratrichodorus minor</I></B>.  Root gall index was highest for hairy vetch.  Numbers of <I>Pratylenchus brachyurus</I></B> per 10 g of roots were particularly high for 'Cahaba White', and 'Vanguard'.  Tillage regime had little effect on nematode densities, but ring nematode did occur at significantly-higher densities under no-till management.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>House and Alzugaray (1989) reported that hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth) sustained a higher densities of above-ground arthropods and a more taxonomically-diverse entomofauna than did crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L.) or wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.).  Soil arthropods were more diverse under no-tillage than under tillage.  Pest and beneficial soil arthropods were most abundant in no-tillage corn preceded by hairy vetch. Differences that were apparent early had dissipated by midseason.<P> As recounted by Bugg et al.  (1991), hairy vetch sustains aphids (pea aphid, <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B>; blue alfalfa aphid, <I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B>) that do not attack pecans, along with associated predators (e.g., various lady beetles) that can disperse to pecan trees and attack pecan aphids.  Hairy vetch is being used as an understory cover crop by some pecan growers in efforts to enhance early-season biological control of pecan aphids.<P> Bugg et al.  (1990) reported a replicated trial conducted in southern Georgia that concerned 20 cool-season cover-cropping regimes and associated insects. Sampling was conducted from February to early June.  Convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) occurred on a seasonal sequence of plants.  These lady beetles first were found in substantial numbers on rye (February 2 and 9), then on crimson clover and lentil Feb.  16 - March 30), later on subterranean clover (March 7-30), still later on narrow-leafed lupin (April 10 - June 6), then hairy vetch (which harbored blue alfalfa aphid [<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B> Shinji] and pea aphid [<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> {Harris}]) (March 28 - June 6), and lastly on mustard and collard (April 10 - June 6).  Bigeyed bugs, mainly <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say), were abundant from late March through late April on 'Vantage' vetch, lentil, and in monocultures of hairy vetch and crimson clover.  Berseem and arrowleaf clovers and hairy vetch/ryegrass remained green later than did many other crops and exhibited exceptionally-high densities of bigeyed bugs on June 2nd. Insidious flower bug (<I>Orius insidiosus</I></B> [Say]), an important predatory insect that attacks numerous agricultural pests, was abundant on several dates on narrow-leafed lupin, hairy vetch (in monoculture and in biculture with annual ryegrass), and lentil. <I>Lygus</I></B> spp., which are important pests of field, row, and orchard crops, were exceptionally abundant on 'Cahaba White' and 'Vantage' vetches; both feature stipular extrafloral nectaries at which <I>Lygus</I></B> frequently fed.  <I>Lygus</I></B> were also abundant on hairy vetch (monoculture and biculture) and, to a lesser extent, on turnip and monocultural crimson clover but were notably scarce on subterranean clover.<P> In coastal Massachusetts, Bugg and Ellis (1990) found that shake samples and whole-plot visual inspections indicated, respectively, that faba bean sustained relatively high densities of bean aphid, <I>Aphis fabae</I></B> Scopoli (Homoptera: Aphididae), and associated lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) during late June.  By contrast, sorghum featured high densities of corn leaf aphid, <I>Rhopalosiphum maidis</I></B> (Fitch), and lady beetles during the first three weeks of July.  Hairy vetch/rye harbored particularly high densities of aphids (pea aphid, <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> [Harris], on hairy vetch; corn leaf aphid and English grain aphid, <I>Sitobion avenae</I></B> (Fabricius), on rye) on July 8th and 23rd, and exhibited consistently-high densities of aphids and aphidophaga, including Syrphidae (Diptera). Sweetclover aphid, <I>Therioaphis riehmi</I></B> (Boerner), was at times abundant on annual white sweetclover but did not attract many aphidophaga.  Shake samples showed that hairy vetch and buckwheat harbored relatively-high densities of insidious flower bug, <I>Orius insidiosus</I></B> (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and tarnished plant bug, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) (Hemiptera: Miridae).  Shake sampling also indicated relatively high densities of saccharophilous ants on faba bean and on buckwheat.  Whole-plot inspection showed that relatively high densities of nectarivorous predatory wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae and Sphecidae) were attracted to the flowers of buckwheat (18 taxa of wasps observed) and annual white sweetclover (11 taxa).<P> Hairy vetch lacks the extrafloral (stipular) nectaries possessed by several of its congeners.  Hairy vetch also sustained relatively high densities of insidious flower bug (<I>Orius insidiosus</I></B> [Say]), which probably fed on the abundant thrips (Thysanoptera) that infested foliage and flowers (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P> Bugg and Ellis (1990) reported that in coastal Massachusetts, both buckwheat and hairy vetch harbored relatively high densities of tarnished plant bug. This insect probably causes negligible damage to the cover crops themselves, but readily disperses from crops rendered unsuitable.  As a pest of orchards, it can be exacerbated by cover crops or flowering understory vegetation.<P> Bugg and Ellis (1990) reported that cultural practices can have implications for arthropods.  Timing of practices may be important. For example, when used as green manure, buckwheat is typically ploughed down after 7 to ten days of flowering.  By contrast, in Massachusetts, insidious flower bug requires about 20 days to produce a new generation.  Mowing or ploughing while most bugs are in the non-dispersive nymphal stages would probably destroy most of them.  On the other hand, hairy vetch takes longer to mature, and might produce more generations of insidious flower bug.  However, it typically must be chopped prior to being incorporated as green manure.  This would probably kill a large proportion of the associated insidious flower bug and seven-spotted lady beetle. Mowing reduces the ability of Fabaceae to support beneficial arthropods and prompts dispersal by <I>Lygus</I></B> spp., Anthocoridae, and other insects. No-tillage approaches may conserve beneficial insects better than does conventional tillage.  Many of the predatory wasps observed in the present study represent ground-nesting species, and tillage would probably interfere with ongoing reproduction.  On the other hand, digger wasps often nest in disturbed areas, and tillage may also make available new potential nesting sites.  If insectary functions are desired, management of cover crops may require some modification.  Use of sickle-bar mowers appears a gentler alternative to flail mowing but is not always feasible. Timing of mowing or tillage may be adjusted to allow maturation or dispersal of beneficial insects.  Remnant strips of cover crops could provide habitat to beneficial insects, and arrest movement by dispersive pests, such as <I>Lygus</I></B> spp.<P> Flexner et al.  (1990) reported that in southern Oregonian pear orchards, certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems. Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, vetch appeared particularly prone to outbreaks of the mite.  Use of herbicides led to increased movement by mites into trees.<P> House (1989) reported a replicated trial in which corn was grown following no-till or conventionally-tilled winter cover crops of hairy vetch, crimson clover, or wheat.  Hairy vetch harbored a more abundant and diverse below- ground arthropod fauna (herbivores and predators) than did crimson clover or wheat. Elateridae, Curculionidae, and Carabidae were particularly abundant following no-till hairy vetch.  Scarabaeidae were especially abundant following conventionally-tilled clover. Elateridae (wireworms) were the dominant herbivores in no-till systems.  Observed faunal differences had dissipated by July.<P> Bugg et al.  (1991) reported that in mature pecan orchards under minimal or commercial management, cool-season understory cover crops of hairy vetch, <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth, and rye, <I>Secale cereale</I></B> (L.), sustained significantly higher densities of aphidophagous lady beetles than did unmown resident vegetation or mowed grasses and weeds.  In cover-cropped understories, mean densities of aphidophagous coccinellids were nearly 6 X greater than in unmown resident vegetation and approximately 87 X greater than in mown grasses and weeds. During late winter and spring, rye harbored abundant bird cherry - oat aphid, <I>Rhopalosiphum padi </I></B> L., whereas hairy vetch sustained pea aphid, <I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> (Harris); blue alfalfa aphid, <I>A.  kondoi </I></B>Shinji; and thrips, <I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp.  The following aphidophagous lady beetles were adundant in cover-cropped understories: (1) convergent lady beetle, <I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin- Meneville; (2) <I>Olla v-nigrum</I></B> (Mulsant); and (3) seven-spotted lady beetle, <I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> L.  In the orchard under minimal management, the rye/vetch mixture led to enhanced densities of convergent lady beetle in the pecan trees.  However, no other effects on coccinellids were seen. There was no evidence of improved biological control of pecan aphids. In the minimal-management orchard, lady beetles occurred on rye in substantial densities from early April through early May.  By contrast, attendance on hairy vetch extended from early April until early June for <I>H. convergens</I></B> and <I>C. septempunctata</I></B>.  By early May, <I>O. v-nigrum</I></B> had had almost entirely left the understory and entered the pecan canopy. From mid April through early May, <I>O. v-nigrum</I></B> was mainly associated with pecan catkins, which contained abundant thrips (mainly <I>Frankliniella tritici</I></B> [Fitch] and <I>F. bispinosa</I></B> [Morgan]).  In the commercial orchard, convergent lady beetle occurred predominantly on rye from early April through early May, and thereafter was found mostly on hairy vetch.  <I>Olla v-nigrum</I></B> relied almost exclusively on rye through early May, by which time many of the beetles had dispersed to the pecan catkins, as in the minimal-management orchard.  Seven-spotted lady beetle relied substantially on rye from late April until mid May, and from early through late May on hairy vetch.  Coccinellid larvae appeared to concentrate almost exclusively on the bird cherry - oat aphid on rye, from early May through early June.<P> Bugg et al.  (1991) reported that <I>Olla v-nigrum</I></B> and convergent lady beetle feed on thrips in lieu of aphids. However, in this case the principally-arboreal <I>O.  v-nigrum</I></B> apparently dispersed from an understory cover crop with abundant aphids to pecan trees, which at the time harbored numerous thrips but few aphids.  This pattern contrasted with that reported by Bugg et al. (1990), who showed that narrow-leafed lupin and various brassicaceous cover crops grown in the open (away from trees) harbored abundant thrips and sustained high densities of <I>O. v-nigrum</I></B> from early April through late May.  The present data suggest that for <I>O.  v-nigrum</I></B>, such sources of thrips in the understory may prove superfluous, at least while pecan is in flower, from mid April through mid May.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>In California, fall-sown hairy vetch has mature seed by mid to late May (Bugg, pers. comm.); the plant is indeterminate and can continue or resume flowering into July, if moisture is available. Hairy vetch does not mature as early as bur medic and has been regarded as a late-maturing (early June) (Bugg et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch requires inoculant type "C" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch is often grown with wheat, oat, or rye; these grasses act as nurse crops (McLeod, 1982).  The cereals also provide structural support to the legume: oat is typically used, but rye, wheat, or barley are also encountered (Goar, 1934). Vetch or Austrian winter pea is good in mixtures with oat in California because maturation is simultaneous.  (Goar, 1934).<P> As described by Luna and Rutherford (1989), Hairy vetch (20 lb/a) and cereal rye (70 lb/a) can be grown in biculture in the winter, then managed no-till by mowing (rather than herbicides) and the residue manipulated to suppress weeds yet allow development of a crop of corn.  Surface-feeding Lumbricidae (earthworms) are apparently responsible for ensuring efficient availability of nitrogen to the economic crop.  This system has been perfected for Virginia and may prove useful elsewhere, with some modifications.<P> Schenk and Werner (1991) reported that various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and apparently is an allelopathic compound.  This chemical can reduce growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.<P> Tomar et al.  (1988) reported a three-year field trial conducted at two sites (Ormstown site and Ste.  Rosalie) in southeastern Quebec.  Corn ('DeKalb W-844') was grown with a simultaneously-seeded intercrop of mixed alfalfa, hairy vetch, and red clover.  Control plots had corn but no legumes.  Nitrogen (as urea) was applied to the surface at 0, 70, and 140 kg/ha in plots with and without legume intercrops.  Simultaneous intercrops suppressed corn yields by 15-27% depending on the year and the site.  Overall, legume intercrops reduced corn yield by about 2 Mg/ha.  Mean legume yields were highly variable, did not vary significantly due to rate of applied nitrogen, and ranged from 342 - 1011 kg/ha at the Ormstown site, and from 442-1252 kg/ha at Ste. Rosalie.<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>When hayed, vetch should be cut in full bloom.  Vetch leaves dry much faster than the stems, so unless the hay is processed promptly in the field, leaves drop off.  Usually one day in the swath is sufficient, then the hay is put in shocks to complete curing (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>The same rules apply in incorporating hairy vetch as with other vetches. Mowing prior to incorporating can prevent light-weight tillage implements from being entangled or slowed by the viny vetch (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Tillage implements used successfully with unmowed hairy vetch include rotovators, heavy disk harrows, and power spaders (e.g., Celli).  Flail and rotary mowers are useful, but sickle-bar mowers should only be used when the vetch is well supported by a cereal companion crop, and the cover crop is dry. Otherwise, the sickle-bar mower may become entangled (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch seldom attains a height of more than 3 or 4 feet except when supported by oat or some other companion crop (Goar, 1934).  In southern Georgia, hairy vetch (cv W67-HU-704) reached a maximum height of 51.69 +/- 1.59 cm (20.35 +/- 0.63 inches) (Bugg et al., 1990).  Sown on October 19 in Mendocino County, 'Lana' woollypod vetch attained a height of 67.31 +/- 4.21 (26.50 +/- 1.66 inches) by May 2 (Bugg et al., unplublished data).  Sown in May, hairy vetch (in biculture with cereal rye) reached about 30 cm (11.81") in coastal Massachusettes (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>In California, flowering of hairy vetch takes place from April through July (Munz, 1973).  In northern California, autumn-sown hairy vetch typically starts flowering in early to mid April, continuing well into July if water is adequate (Bugg, pers. comm.). In coastal Massachusetts, hairy vetch sown on May 7 began flowering in mid July, with peak flowering occurring about August 18 (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Although hairy vetch is said to make good silage or pasture (Duke, 1981), there have been reports of toxic effects on cattle fed high proportions of hairy vetch (Bugg, pers. comm.). For example, Odriozola et al.  (1991) reported that in Argentina, grazing a herd of 33 Aberdeen Angus bulls for 20 days in a pasture composed mainly of hairy vetch led to 8 of the animals developing conjunctivitis, rinitis, dermatitis, fever, and loss of hair. Death of all 8 animals occurred within 15 days after development of the symptoms.  No more animals became sick after five days had elapsed following removal of the herd from the pasture.  The toxin responsible remains unknown: other vetches contain cyanogenic glycosides, but the syndrome observed here does not correspond to these toxins.  Some have ascribed the toxicity to aphids associated with the hairy vetch.<P> Duke (1981) recounted that the seed of <I>Vicia villosa</I></B>, though less toxic than those of <I>Vicia sativa</I></B>, are poisonous to cattle, causing pain, bellowing, sexual excitement, and convulsions.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch is shade tolerant, according to Brinton (1989). It has been successfully overseeded into standing corn and used as an understory cover crop in vineyards and orchards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Paraquat (0.6 kg ai/ha) and HOE-39866 (0.8 kg ai/ha) gave control of crimson clover and hairy vetch regardless of the date of application (Griffin and Dabney, 1990).<P> White and Worsham (1990) evaluated eight herbicide treatments for hairy vetch and another eight for crimson clover under no-till management preceding corn and cotton.  Preceding cotton, the treatments were: (1) Paraquat, (2) Paraquat + 2,4-D, (3) Paraquat +cyanazine, (4) Glyphosate, (5) Glyphosate + 2,4-D, (6) Glyphosate + cyanazine, (7) 2,4-D, (8) Cyanazine.  Preceding corn, the treatments were: (1) Paraquat, (2) Paraquat + 2,4-D, (3) Paraquat + dicamba, (4) Glyphosate, (5) Glyphosate + 2,4-D, (6) Glyphosate + dicamba, (7) 2,4-D, (8) Dicamba.  Paraquat alone of in combination with dicamba, 2,4-D or cyanazine, and cyanazine alone were the best controls for crimson clover. Glyphosate alone was relatively ineffective at controlling hairy vetch in corn; all other treatments were effective against hairy vetch in corn.  In cotton, the only treatments that worked well against hairy vetch were 2,4-D or cyanazine alone, or combined with glyphosate.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Schenk and Werner (1991) reported that various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and, apparently, is an allelopathic compound. Schenk and Werner (1991) reported that this chemical can reduce growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce, but that pea was only slightly affected.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), hairy vetch tolerates annual precipitation ranging from 3.1-16.6 dm, with a mean of 42 cases being 8.1).  Hofstetter (1988) stated that the species grows best when rainfall exceeds 30 in/yr.<P> Goar (1934) mentioned that hairy vetch is more drought resistant than other vetches, yielding well where other species fail. During winter, it produces little above-ground growth, but its root development continues, accounting for its drought resistance. Where rainfall is late, pre-irrigation about October 1 is important.  In the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, on soils of good water-holding capacity, no additional irrigation is typically required.  An irrigation in April is sometimes necessary.  On lighter soils, three to five irrigations are often necessary.  In coastal and foothill areas, normal rainfall alone usually suffices (Goar, 1934).<P> A study by Zachariassen and Power (1991) indicated that crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Zachariassen and Power (1991) reported that crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values (Zachariassen and Power, 1991).<P> Frye and Blevins (1989) reported a study in which corn (<I>Zea mays</I></B>) was grown following cover crops of hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B>), bigflower vetch (<I>Vicia grandiflora</I></B>), crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B>), and rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>); control plots used corn residue.  From 1977 through 1983, nitrogen was applied at 0, 50, and 100 kg/ha; from 1984 through 1985, the nitrogen rates were 0, 85, and 170 kg/ha. No-till was used throughout the study from 1977 through 1983. Thereafter, split plot assignment was to no-till and conventional tillage. Under the no-till regime, hairy vetch gave significantly higher yields than any of the other levels of cover crop.  Under hairy vetch + 100 kg/ha of N per year, corn yields increased at an annual rate of 500 kg/ha from 1977 to 1981; the corresponding yields with rye and control plots remained the same or declined slightly during that period.  No-till hairy vetch showed significantly-higher soil organic matter than either rye or fallow.  Hairy vetch provided yield improvements above those attained with nitrogen addition alone, and it appears to be an economically-feasible cover crop for use in rotation with corn in Kentucky.<P> In a four-year field study in Nebraska, Power et al.  (1991) found that hairy vetch tilled under supplied N equivalent to or greater than 55 lb of fertilizer N per acre.  Hairy vetch managed without tillage contributed very little N, even after several years.  Much of the N may have been lost by volatilization. Contrasting results from the southeastern United States suggest that under warmer, more humid conditions, N mineralization from surface residues does provide substantial N to succeeding corn.<P> On a sandy soil on the coastal plain of Georgia, cover crops led to a higher percentage by weight of water-stable aggregates (>250 microns in diameter), and hairy vetch plots showed better water infiltration than did fallow or wheat plots (McVay et al., 1989).<P> Wagger and Denton (1989) reported a three-year field study conducted on a fine sandy loam soil.  Corn was grown in no-till plots following cover crops of hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B>) or wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B>) and in control plots with no cover crops.  Spacing of rows of cover crops was not specified. Cover-cropped plots showed no increases in total porosity, macroporosity, or hydraulic conductivity over control plots. There was also no decrease in bulk density in cover-cropped plots. Vehicular traffic, on the other hand, led to severe compaction of the soil.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> includes  'Madison Vetch,' 'Winter' vetch, and 'Hairy' vetch, and the "Dasycarpa" forms 'Auburn,' 'Oregon,' and 'Lana.'<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Vetch is relatively large seeded and able to establish even in orchards with heavy leaf deposition (e.g., walnut or pecan) (Bugg, pers. obs.)  Seed of hairy vetch is smaller than common, purple and 'Lana', therefore seeding rate may be reduced by 15% (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Vetch, as with most legumes, does well with supplemental phosphorus and sulfur. (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>The price of hairy vetch seed was about $1.25 per pound retail in California during 1992-1993 (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch seed is widely available from commercial suppliers (Bugg, pers. obs.).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch can be killed by close mowing at peak flower (Luna and Rutherford, 1989). Mowing high, e.g., 10 inches or greater, can rejuvenate flowering vetch (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> Early spring mowing at 1-2 inches can be done without harming hairy vetch because it is slow to grow early, as observed in walnuts in Biggs, CA when mowed at 1 inch to shred walnuts on March 13. (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch is said to facilitate the availability of potassium to other, shallower-rooted, crops (check with Liebhardt on reference).<P>

<DD>Duke (1981) recounted that the seed of <I>Vicia villosa</I></B>, though less toxic than those of <I>Vicia sativa</I></B>, are poisonous to cattle, causing pain, bellowing, sexual excitement, and convulsions.<P> All vetches seem to provide habitat (cover) for small mammals such as rabbits and mice.  (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>According to Goar (1934), seeding should be done in the fall, October or November, in the interior valleys.  If the crop is to be used for both pasture and hay, seed on or before October 20.  In coastal and foothill sections, seeding may be safely delayed.  In Marin and Alameda counties, December-January 1 seedings may work. Lacking irrigation seeding is often delayed until after the first rains.  Under summer-fallow where weeds are not severe, the seeding may be done in the "dust".<P> According to Madson (1951), in California, hairy vetch should be sown from October through November.  If seeding is delayed until after the first fall rain, which may not come until November or December, the soil may be so cold that the stand will be poor. Hofstetter (1988) suggested that sowing be at least 40 days (preferably 50 or 60) before the first killing frost.<P> In coastal central and northern California, it can be planted during the spring and grown as a summer annual cover crop (Richard Smith, pers. comm.).  In the Sacramento Valley, it can be sown as early as August if irrigation is available (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.).<P> John France (pers. comm.) of Porterville, Tulare County, seeded pea/vetch (hairy and common)/oat mixtures into citrus (orange) understories in late November or during December.  The winter dormancy expressed by hairy vetch and field pea allow a high proportion of bare ground to remain, which presumably makes orchard temperatures warmer.during the critical frost period (February).<P> McLeod (1982) stated that hairy vetch is the only vetch recommended for fall sowing in the North.  Marianne Sarrantonio (pers. comm.) stated that bigflower vetch shows even greater cold tolerance than any available hairy vetch lines; thus, this form may also be suitable for fall sowing.<P> When overseeding hairy vetch into soybeans, Hofstetter (1988) recommended 40 lb/acre at early leaf- yellowing or early leaf-drop (30-40 days before killing frost).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that hairy vetch can behave as a perennial, biennial, or annual, and Munz (1971) stated that in California it behaves as an annual or biennial.  McLeod (1982) stated that it is an annual legume that often acts as a biennial.  Goar (1934) stated that the species is annual in habit of growth when fall-planted, and it is a winter annual in Georgia (Bugg et al., 1989).  In coastal central and northern California, it can be planted during the spring and grown as a summer annual cover crop (Richard Smith, pers. comm.).  In the Sacramento Valley, it can be sown as early as August, if irrigation is available (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.).<P> Hairy vetch grows little during the winter, but rapidly in the spring (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that hairy vetch tolerates mean annual temperatures ranging from 4.3-21.1 C, with a mean of 42 cases of 12.0.  Duke (1981) also recounted briefly the history of hairy vetch breeding and seed production in the U.S.  The 'Madison Vetch' variety was developed in Nebraska, and is apparently cold tolerant. Cold-tolerant forms of hairy vetch were grown in Michigan, but production shifted to Oregon, where more glabrous, heat-tolerant forms have dominated.  The latter forms are used in the Southeast, and include dasycarpa varieties, such as 'Auburn', 'Oregon', and 'Lana.' This seems to suggest that the most cold-tolerant forms are less available now than formerly.  Hairier varieties are typically more winter hardy (McLeod, 1982), but this correlation does not always hold (Duke, 1981).  Hairy vetch has been termed the most winter hardy of the cultivated vetches (McLeod, 1982), but Marianne Sarrantonio (pers. comm.) stated in 1992 that bigflower vetch (<I>Vicia grandiflora</I></B> Scop.  <I>kitaibeliana</I></B> W.  Koch, cv 'Woodford') is more cold tolerant than any of the many hairy vetch accessions that she has evaluated at Rodale Institute Research Center (Kutztown, Berks County, Pennsylvania).<P> In the south, hairy vetch does not renew growth during the temporary warm spells, and consequently, is not as likely to be killed by severe frosts later (McLeod, 1982).  Hairy vetch is said to be unlike other vetches in its extreme winter hardiness (Madson, 1951); it is seldom, if ever, winter-killed in California (Goar, 1934) and is more cold-tolerant than crimson clover.  (Hargrove, 1986).  At high elevations, if established before the ground freezes, it will remain dormant during the winter and renew growth when the soil thaws out in the spring.  In the valleys where winters are not severe, it will go dormant with little growth until the spring (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch has a taproot that extends to a depth of 1-3 ft (Brinton, 1989). McLeod (1982) considered hairy vetch shallow rooted.  Goar (1934) mentioned that hairy vetch is more drought resistant than other vetches, yielding well where other species fail; during winter, it produces little above-ground growth, but its root development continues, accounting for its drought resistance.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch is useful as forage, hay, silage, green manure, and in cover crops (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982).<P> In California, its cold-induced dormancy makes hairy vetch less desirable as a winter cover crop than common or purple vetch because it grows little in the winter (McLeod, 1982).  Similarly, the scant top growth during cold weather reduces its value as winter pasture (Goar, 1934).<P> In a three-year field trial conducted by Tomar et al. (1988) at two sites (Ormstown site and Ste. Rosalie) in southeastern Quebec, corn ('DeKalb W-844') was grown with a simultaneously-seeded intercrop of mixed alfalfa, hairy vetch, and red clover.  Control plots had corn but no legumes.  Nitrogen (as urea) was applied to the surface at 0, 70, and 140 kg/ha in plots with and without legume intercrops.  Simultaneous intercrops suppressed corn yields by 15-27% depending on the year and the site.  Overall, legume intercrops reduced corn yield by about 2 Mg/ha.  Mean legume yields were highly variable, did not vary significantly due to rate of applied nitrogen, and ranged from 342 - 1011 kg/ha at the Ormstown site and from 442-1252 kg/ha at Ste.  Rosalie.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Above-ground nitrogen contents (kg/ha) obtained in individual studies were given by Smith et al. (1987) as: 133, 132, 209, 153. Proportion of nitrogen estimated obtained from fixation were given as: 0.79, 0.84, 0.83, 0.75.  Estimated N fertilizer equivalences under no-tillage regimes were given (kg/ha) as: followed by cotton - 67-101; followed by corn - 78, 100, 200, 200; followed by sorghum - 89 or less, 50 - 128.  Above-ground nitrogen content (kg/ha) obtained in mixture with rye was 158.  Proportion of nitrogen estimated obtained from fixation were given as: 0.71.  Proportion of nitrogen accumlated in roots was given as: 0.09.<P> Hairy vetch above-ground N content has been estimated as: (1) N content 4%, with total N content of 80-200 lb/acre (Hofstetter, 1988); (2) up to 100 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982); (3) N content 4%, with total N content 57 lb/acre when overseeded into soybean (Hofstetter, 1988); (4) mean N content of three year field trials in Georgia were 134 kg/ha and 153 kg/ha (Hargrove, 1986); (5) McVay et al.  (1989) stated that hairy vetch replaced 123 kg/ha of N in corn and sorghum production in Georgia; above-ground N-content of hairy vetch was 128 kg/ha.<P> Hargrove (1982) reported studies with no-till corn showing that, with no nitrogen fertilizer applied, there was about twice as much available soil nitrogen in early June following hairy vetch than following cereal rye as the winter cover crop.  Corn grown with hairy vetch mulch had higher tissue nitrogen content and showed much less nitrogen stress than corn grown in rye mulch.  Yields of corn were almost as high in hairy vetch plots where 88 lbs N/a was added.  Hairy vetch provided an average of about 80 to 90 lbs N/a per year during the 5-year study period.  Dry Matter Yields and N Content were estimated as 2.4 tons/acre (5.38 Mg/ha) at 4.8% N = 230 lb./acre total nitrogen.<P> In Georgia, hairy vetch managed with minimum tillage provided almost all the N required for corn and grain sorghum and gave higher yields than did conventional tillage (green manure) (Hargrove, 1982).<P> Frye and Blevins (1989) recounted a study in which corn (<I>Zea mays</I></B>) was grown following cover crops of hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B>), bigflower vetch (<I>Vicia grandiflora</I></B>), crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B>), and rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>); control plots used corn residue.  From 1977 through 1983, nitrogen was applied at 0, 50, and 100 kg/ha; from 1984 through 1985, the nitrogen rates were 0, 85, and 170 kg/ha. No-till was used throughout the study from 1977 through 1983. Thereafter, split plot assignment was to no-till and conventional tillage.  Under the no-till regime, hairy vetch gave significantly higher yields than any of the other levels of cover crop.  Under hairy vetch + 100 kg/ha of N per year, corn yields increased at an annual rate of 500 kg/ha from 1977 to 1981; the corresponding yields with rye and control plots remained the same or declined slightly during that period.  No-till hairy vetch showed significantly-higher soil organic matter than either rye or fallow. Hairy vetch provided yield improvements above those attained with nitrogen addition alone, and it appears to be an economically-feasible cover crop for use in rotation with corn in Kentucky.<P> McCracken et al. (1989) reported a study in which first-year residual effects of nitrogen fertilization and cover crops of hairy vetch and rye were observed in corn.  Control plots used corn stover alone.  One year after discontinuing the practice, the residual effect of N-fertilization was to increase N uptake by corn by 20.4 kg/ha over that seen with corn residue alone.  With hairy vetch, uptake by corn was higher by 28.0 kg/ha.  Holdover effects of rye cover cropping were small and inconsistent.<P> Power et al. (1991) conducted a four-year field study in Nebraska in which hairy vetch tilled under supplied N equivalent to or greater than 55 lb of fertilizer N per acre.  Hairy vetch managed without tillage contributed very little N, even after several years.  Much of the N may have been lost by volatilization. Contrasting results from the southeastern United States suggest that under warmer, more humid conditions, N mineralization from surface residues does provide substantial N to succeeding corn.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that hairy vetch is native to Europe and Asia, ranging from the Boreal Moist to Wet through Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zones.  It is a frequent escape in much of the U.S. and Canada where it is found in roadsides and waste places. Munz (1973) wrote that it is naturalized in waste places from central California north but is less common in southern California. It can grow in all areas of the US, during the cool, moist season, according to McLeod (1982).<P> As recounted by Duke (1981), many varieties of hairy vetch have been developed for specific areas.  Cold-tolerant hairy forms prevailed in Michigan, where seed production originally centered. 'Madison Vetch' was developed in Nebraska, 'Auburn' in Alabama, 'Oregon' in California, and 'Lana' in Oregon.  'Winter' vetch is glabrous and tolerant of the southern winter.<P>

Currently, hairy vetch is grown for seed in Western Oregon (McLeod, 1982).<P> The Southern Seedsmen's Association 1990-91 Directory and Buyers' Guide listed 39 commercial suppliers of hairy vetch seed, including including 12 from Oregon.  Duke (1981) mentioned that in the U.S., most seed is produced in Oregon, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and western Washington.<P> Hairy vetch volunteers readily if allowed to mature seed, particularly preceding a cereal grain crop.  There is not danger of it becoming a weed in grain fields, however, if it is harvested before the seed pods become filled (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), hairy vetch tolerates soil pH ranging from 4.9-8.2 with a mean of 40 cases being 6.6, and it is reputed to be tolerant of high pH.  Hofstetter (1988) stated that the species grows best when pH is from 6.0-7.0.<P> Hairy vetch can grow on acid soils that will not sustain clover and alfalfa, and it tolerates alkaline soils (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seeding depths have been given as 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982), 1/2-3/4 inches (Slayback, pers. comm.), and 1.5-2.5 inches according to moisture conditions, or deeper if necessary (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch will volunteer if allowed to mature seed (McLeod, 1982).  Strip mowing or tillage in an orchard understory can permit remnant stands to reseed the entire orchard, especially if rotary mowers are used to scatter seed following maturation; avoid direct placement of N-rich fertilizers on areas (e.g., alleys) devoted to hairy vetch (Bugg et al., 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that hairy vetch does best on sandy or sandy loam soil.  Sandy loam was recommended by Madson (1951), and Goar (1934), stated that although the species is especially adapted to lighter sandy and sandy-loam soils, and that it does well on light soils where other varieties fail, it succeeds on most soil types, if drainage is good.  McLeod (1982) agreed that it can grow on any well drained soil, even infertile soil.<P> Do not overseed vetch into corn when soil moisture is scant or on shaley, shallow or crust-prone soils (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Hairy vetch benefits from the usual recommended practices for establishing cool-season annual legumes in California: (1) inoculate seed properly with viable rhizobia of the correct strain (strain "C" for hairy vetch); (2) prepare a good seedbed or mow competing vegetation closely immediately prior to seeding; sow by October 15; (3) seed in mixtures with other legumes and grasses; (4) use a drill to seed, or disk, broadcast, and cultipack; and (5) irrigate promptly following seeding, making sure that good soil moisture is maintained during germination and early growth (Bugg, pers. comm.).  When overseeding hairy vetch into soybeans, late summer/early fall rain is important in ensuring good establishment and winter-hardiness (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates for hairy vetch have been given as 33 lbs/acre (to result in 12 vetch seeds per square foot, or 522,720 seeds per acre) (Goar, 1934); 30-45 lb/a (Brinton, 1989); 40 to 50 lbs/acre (Madson, 1951; Miller et al., 1989); and 40-60 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982).  25-30 lb/acre is suggested when hairy vetch is drilled after small grains, and 40 lb/acre when overseeded into corn or soybeans (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Common names are hairy vetch, sand vetch, winter vetch, and woolypod vetch (Duke, 1981).  The species has also been termed wooly vetch (Hermann, 1960), Russian vetch, or Siberian vetch (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth (Duke, 1981); <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> and <I>Vicia dasycarpa</I></B> are now merged into <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> (Duke, 1981).<P>

<P>
Cover crops have various effects, both beneficial and deleterious,
on orchard pest problems. Ideally, cover crops might be selected
or managed so as to: 1) not harbor important pests; 2) divert
generalist pests; 3) confuse specialist pests visually or olfactorally
and thus reduce their colonization of orchard trees; 4) alter
host-plant nutrition and thereby reduce pest success; 5) reduce
dust and thereby reduce spider mite outbreaks; 6) change the microclimate
and thereby reduce pest success; and 7) increase natural enemy
abundance or efficiency, thereby increasing biological control
of arthropod pests. This review article (65 references) examines
various studies of cover crops for tree nuts, pome fruits, stone
fruits, and citrus, with examples from the United States and Canada.
Only the Californian cases are detailed in this summary.<BR>

<H3>Almond</H3>

<P>
Two ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are particularly damaging
to almonds in central California: pavement ant <I>(Tetramorium
caespitum </I>[L.]) and southern fire ant <I>(Solenopsis xyloni
</I>McCook). These feed on nutmeats after the nuts have fallen
to the ground, and in a study by Barnett et al. (1989) were especially
damaging amid cover crops of soft chess <I>(Bromus mollis </I>L.,
cv 'Blando', Poaceae), strawberry clover <I>(Trifolium fragiferum
</I>L., cv 'Sauna', Fabaceae), and resident weedy vegetation,
as compared with residual herbicide. However, the same study showed
that cover crops of soft chess, strawberry clover or resident
vegetation accelerate the decomposition of unharvested almonds,
which otherwise represent an overwintering niche for navel orangeworm
<I>(Amyelois transitella </I>Walker, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).
Breakdown prompted by moisture in cover crops and by flail mowing
greatly decreased the spring emergence of the moths. Thus, cover
cropping may enhance the control of one pest while exacerbating
others. This example illustrates the trade-offs implicit in different
management options. An ongoing comparison of organic and conventional
almond orchards by Lonnie Hendricks (1991) confirms that cover
crops can be an important tool in managing arthropod pests and
their natural enemies.<BR>

<H3>Walnut</H3>

<P>
Sluss (1967) found that convergent lady beetle <I>(Hippodamia
convergens </I>Guerin-Meneville) and <I>Olla abdominalis </I>(Say)
(now termed <I>0. v-nigrum </I>[Mulsant]) were the two most abundant
Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) attacking walnut aphid <I>(Chromaphis
juglandicola </I>[Kaltenbach], Homoptera: Aphididae) in Persian
walnut orchards of northern California. Sluss believed that ground
cover (of unspecified composition) can assist biological control
by convergent lady beetle because it harbors aphids (which serve
as alternate prey) from late February through
<P>
April or May. If ground cover is disked or chopped too early,
i.e., before walnut aphid is available as food, beetles will disperse
from the orchards. Such disengagement of the predators may lead
to subsequent eruptions of the aphid. Chopping of understory cover
killed many lady beetles, but some (including pupae) survived.
<I>Olla v-nigrum, </I>a principally arboreal lady beetle, tolerated
lower threshold densities of walnut aphid than did convergent
lady beetle (Sluss, 1967), and remained in trees during the late
spring and early summer, when the latter species dispersed to
other habitats.<BR>

<H3>Apple</H3>

<P>
In an unreplicated trial in northern California, Altieri and Schmidt
(1985, 1986) found that over a two-year period, codling moth infested
36.1 percent of the apples in an organic apple orchard with a
cover crop of bell beans <I>(Vicia faba </I>L.), whereas a nearby
clean-cultivated organic orchard suffered a 45 percent fruit loss
from this pest. Bell bean has extrafloral nectaries that attract
beneficial insects.<BR>

<H3>Cherry</H3>

<P>
In California, mountain leafhopper <I>(Colladonus montanus </I>[Van
Duzee], Homoptera: Cicadellidae) transmits a myco-plasma-like
organism that causes buckskin disease (X-disease) of cherry. This
leafhopper reproduces on cool-season <I>Medicago </I>spp. and
<I>Trifolium </I>spp. (Fabaceae), which may harbor the pathogen
(Purcell et al., 1987). Thus, there is circumstantial evidence
that cover crops of these groups should be used only with care
in cherry orchards. There are, however, no field studies showing
increased damage to cherry trees with undersown leguminous covercrops
(A. H. Purcell, pers. comm.). Apparently, the legume must survive
at least a full year to be an effective reservoir of the pathogen,
an atypical scenario for annual clovers and cool-season medics.
<BR>

<H3>Citrus and Avocado</H3>

<P>
Various grasses produce windblown pollen, used as an alternate
food by the predatory mite <I>Euseius tularensis </I>Congdon (Acari:
Phytoseiidae) (Kennett et al., 1979). This species and others
in the genus attack several pests of Californian citrus and avocado,
including avocado brown mite <I>(Oligonychus punicae </I>[Hirst],
Acari: Tetranychidae), citrus thrips <I>(Scirtothrips citri </I>Moulton,
Thysanoptera: Thripidae), citrus red mite <I>(Panonychus citri
</I>[McGregor], Acari: Tetranychidae), and scale crawlers (Homoptera:
Diaspididae) (Congdon and McMurtry, 1985). This mite can subsist
and reproduce on diets of various pollens (Zhimo and McMurtry,
1990). Deposition of windblown pollen during late winter and early
spring has been shown to be particularly important in hastening
the seasonal buildup of populations of these mites (Kennett et
al., 1979). In California, pollens from wind-pollinated tree species
(e.g., valley oak, <I>Quercus lobata </I>Nee', Fagaceae) are available
as early as March (Munz, 1973), whereas annual and perennial grasses
produce pollen mainly during April and May. Pollens are attractive
foods (Zhimo and McMurtry, 1990), and, if excessively abundant,
might be expected to divert the predators from the target pests.
Of the grass pollens thus far tested, none is a sufficient diet
for E. <I>tularensis </I>to sustain peak reproductive rates for
more than one generation. The thick exine coats of grass pollens
may render them less suitable as foods than other pollens (e.g.,
apple pollen) (Ouyang et al., 1992).<BR>

<H3>Management Techniques</H3>

<P>
In California, legal and market pressures and the development
of pesticide-resistant pests are motivating farmers to explore
cover cropping as at least a partial alternative to insecticides
and acaricides. Californian orchardists are exploring the use
of cover crops to provide key resources for predators and parasites
of orchard pests, and to arrest generalist pests, such as <I>Lygus
</I>spp. and flower thrips <I>(Frankliniella </I>spp.).<BR>

<P>
The options being explored include the use of: 1) resident vegetation
that harbors abundant beneficial arthropods; 2) alternate strip
management of cover crops, including, planting, mowing, and tillage
schemes designed to ensure temporal continuity of habitat for
both beneficial and pest arthropods; 3) commercial &quot;insectary
mixes&quot; of plants that are attractive to beneficial arthropods;
4) mowing and deposition of clippings as mulch to harbor generalist
predators. The last-named option is poorly understood in orchard
systems.<BR>

<H3>Strip Management</H3>

<P>
The understory vegetation in an orchard need not be managed uniformly.
Different zones maybe treated differently; we term this &quot;strip
management,&quot; because the different treatments are usually
applied linearly, and the different understory zones appear as
bands or strips running through an orchard. Strip management of
cover crops may entail: 1) sowing cover crops of different floristic
composition in different strips; 2) mowing strips at different
times; 3) tilling strips at different times; and 4) combinations
of 1,2, and 3. Sowing of different mixes leads to stands with
differing statures and phenologies, affording diverse resources
to pest and beneficial arthropods. A complex of stands having
differing floristic compositions could remain attractive to arthropods
for longer periods of time. Paradoxically, mowing can be used
either to kill or to rejuvenate a cover crop. Close mowing of
annual cover crops in full flower may kill the cover crop. Plant
species having indeterminate growth habits can be mowed relatively
high and before peak blossoming to extend attractiveness to both
beneficial and pest arthropods. High mowing preserves vegetative
and flower buds and permits regrowth of many species. By contrast,
tillage usually destroys cover crops.<BR>

<P>
Strip management can permit a grower to attain multiple goals
and balance competing aims, such as reducing competition from
the cover crop or liberating nutrients for the trees, while maintaining
habitat or allowing cover crops to reseed. Byway of illustration,
a walnut orchardist in northern California (R. Lester, Winters,
California) mows or tills strips of woollypod vetch <I>(Vicia
villosa </I>Roth ssp. <I>dasycarpa </I>Ten., cv 'Lana') and common
vetch <I>(Vicia sativa </I>L.), while leaving alternating remnant
strips to reseed the entire alley. After seed of vetches has matured
in May, flowering will resume if soil moisture is sufficient.
Thus, arthropod habitat can be retained through time.<BR>

<P>
A prune grower (T. Turkovich, Winters, California) sowed alternating
alleys to different mixtures. One set of alleys received a mixture
of woollypod vetch, common vetch, and oat <I>(Avena sativa </I>L.).
The other set of alleys was seeded to a mixture of crimson clover
<I>(Trifolium incarnatum </I>L.), rose clover <I>(Trifolium hirtum
</I>All.), subterranean clovers <I>(Trifolium subterraneum </I>L.),
barrel medic <I>(Medicago truncatula </I>Gaertn., cv 'Jemmalong'),
rattail fescue <I>(Vulpia myuros </I>L., cv 'Zorro'), and soft
chess <I>(Bromus mollis </I>L., cv 'Blando'). At two-week intervals
beginning in late June, every third alley is mowed high. Thus,
maturation of seed is permitted, cover crop regrowth (1)y vetches
only) is staggered, and resident warm-season vegetation gradually
supplants the cool-season annual complexes. Beneficial insects,
such as lady beetles, ants, and parasitic Hymenoptera persist
in the understory under this regime (R.L. Bugg, pers. obs.). Outbreaks
of two-spotted spider mite <I>(Tetranychus urticae </I>Koch, Acari:
Tetranychidae) have been avoided since 1991, when this scheme
was adopted. Prior to this, in the spring of 1990, cover crops
were mowed closely throughout the orchard, and a spider mite outbreak
ensued, necessitating an application of acaricide.<BR>

<H3>Insectary Mixes</H3>

<P>
Proprietary mixes of reputed &quot;insectary crops&quot; are now
commercially available from several sources. Several of the plants
in these mixes are known to attract beneficial arthropods of interest
to orchardists; others have not been assessed formally. Few have
been evaluated in critical experiments on orchard biological control.
The authors suggested that most of the plants employed attract
wide ranges of entomophagous arthropods, and that increasing numbers
of farmers are using insectary cover crops.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
Various cover crops harbor distinctive complexes of beneficial
and pest arthropods, and diverse trophic relationships have been
well documented in the literature. More study is required to determine:
1) whether cover cropping modifies orchard microclimate and target-crop
nutritional status, thereby influencing pest dynamics; and 2)
whether and how cover crop species composition, spatial interspersion
of species, and management (irrigation, mowing, and tillage) affect
build-up and movement of arthropods, and resultant pest damage
to the target crop. Formal replicated trials are essential to
evaluate these issues in the context of overall orchard management.

<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Perennial ryegrass is the most important of the perennial grasses worldwide (Wilkins, 1991).<P> Strips of perennial ryegrass can facilitate harvest of interplanted pak choi during cool, wet weather.  The perennial ryegrass can help reduce soil compaction caused by traffic through muddy fields.  The living mulch might also reduce weed infestations, soil erosion, and fertilizer needs, and enhance soil organic matter, water infiltration, and retention of nutrients and moisture.  A possible problem is interference by the perennial ryegrass with the economic crop (Wiles et al., 1989).<P> A three-year field study of strawberry (<I>Frageria X ananassa</I></B> Duchesne, Rosaceae, cv 'Sparkle' and 'Honeoye') showed that living mulches of wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.), Kentucky bluegrass (<I>Poa pratensis</I></B> L.), or perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) provided protection from winter storms, and thereby improved fruit yield and quality.  When snow covered the strawberry plants, living mulches did not enhance yield or quality.  Plots with living mulches showed less soil compaction. When wind damaged strawberry blossoms, yields were better in plots with living mulches.  When no such damage occurred, yields did not differ. Living mulches effectively suppressed weeds. Perennial ryegrass, which spreads by tillering but did not invade the strawberry rows, and which grows tall enough to provide wind protection, appeared the best living mulch tested (Newenhouse and Dana, 1989).<P> Increased efficiency of N-uptake could have important ramifications in avoiding excess leaching of nitrates.  Studies in Wales indicate that the newest variety of perennial ryegrass, Ba 10761 gave a 20% higher yield of nitrogen than did the oldest, S.321.  Nitrogen was applied at three rates: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2 t/ha.  Overall mean proportions of nitrogen recovered over nitrogen applied were as follows for the four varieties tested Ba 10761: 0.62, Talbot: 0.57, Tove: 0.56, and S.321: 0.51 (Wilkins and Lovatt, 1989).<P>

<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Perennial ryegrass has slower seedling establishment and lower seedling vigor than does annual ryegrass (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>In most of California, perennial ryegrass behaves as a cool-season perennial (Bugg, pers. comm.).  When soil moisture is low in the summer, perennial ryegrass goes dormant (Miller, 1984).<P> Perennial ryegrass is self-incompatible (an obligate outcrosser); inbreeding depression can be severe (Wilkins, 1991).<P> Perennial ryegrass stands can be maintained for about 3-4 years (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed is adundant for both annual and perennial ryegrasses (Miller, 1984). Southern Seedsmen's Association 1990-91 Directory and Buyers' Guide lists 36 suppliers of seed.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses are bunch grasses (Miller, 1984).<P> Erect and prostrate forms of Kangaroo Valley perennial ryegrass are available (Shah et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Perennial ryegrass attains a height of about 90 cm (36 in.) according to Miller (1984), and 30-60 cm according to Munz (1973).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Perennial ryegrass stands can be maintained for about 3-4 years (Miller, 1984).  Perennial ryegrass responds positively to close but infrequent mowings (every 30 to 31 days); this sort of mowing regime may help maintain perennial ryegrass in the presence of taller-statured grasses, such as orchardgrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>When seeded along with legumes or some other grasses, annual and perennial ryegrasses contribute to better control of weeds (Miller, 1984).<P> Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be sown along with small grains, such as cereal rye and to some extent oat.  Oat does not complement ryegrasses as well because forage is produced at the same time (Editor's note: cereal rye produces earlier) (Miller, 1984).<P> Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be sown at 20-28 kg/ha (18-25 lb/a) for pure stands, and 11-17 kg/ha (10-15 lb/a) if sown along with a legume or a small grain (Miller, 1984).<P> Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be seeded into bermuda grass sod (Miller, 1984).<P> Mixtures of perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) and white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I></B> L.) yield less than heavily fertilized monocultures of the former.  Addition of small amounts of nitrogen in the spring lead to reduction of the proportions of clover in the stand.  The present study indicates that the relative growth rate of clover is as great as that of the grass when nitrogen is added and greater when nitrogen is not added. There was no evidence that fertilized grass overtopped clover. Clover showed a smaller ratio of leaf area to total above-ground dry weight, but had a higher proportion of its lamina in the upper, well-lit strata (Woledge, 1988).<P> Perennial ryegrass responds positively to close but infrequent mowings (every 30 to 31 days).  This sort of mowing regime may help maintain perennial ryegrass in the presence of taller-statured grasses, such as orchardgrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).  In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> <I>Trifolium repens</I></B> in the same 1-ha old field will diverge genetically through time depending on the grass species with which it is associated. Reciprocal transplant experiments have demonstrated differential success of <I>T.  repens</I></B> from areas dominated by the grasses <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> or <I>Agrostis capillaris</I></B> to areas dominated by the original grass or other perennial grasses.  The results suggest that, even within a field, white clover clones are genetically adapted to perform better amid stands of particular grasses (Turkington, 1989).<P> Studies by McNeill and Wood (1990) using an environmental chamber with an atmosphere enriched by 15N indicated that white clover did not rapidly transfer nitrogen to associated ryegrass. The plants were mycorrhizal.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Very palatable to livestock.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be sown at 20-28 kg/ha (18-25 lb/a) for pure stands, and 11-17 kg/ha (10-15 lb/a) if sown along with a legume or a small grain (Miller, 1984).<P> Both annual and perennial ryegrasses can be seeded into bermuda grass sod (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>When seeded along with legumes or some other grasses, annual and perennial ryegrasses contribute to better control of weeds (Miller, 1984).<P> A three-year field study of strawberry (<I>Frageria X ananassa</I></B> Duchesne Rosaceae; cv 'Sparkle' and 'Honeoye') showed that living mulches of wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.), Kentucky bluegrass (<I>Poa pratensis</I></B> L.), or perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) effectively suppressed weeds. Perennial ryegrass, which spreads by tillering but did not invade the strawberry rows, and which grows tall enough to provide wind protection, appeared the best living mulch tested (Newenhouse and Dana, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be seeded at a depth of 1.25 cm (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be sown at 20-28 kg/ha (18-25 lb/a) for pure stands, and 11-17 kg/ha (10-15 lb/a) if sown along with a legume or a small grain (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Both annual and perennial ryegrasses should be cut no closer to the ground than about 7.5 cm (3 in.) (Miller, 1984).<P> Perennial ryegrass responds positively to close but infrequent mowings (every 30 to 31 days).  This sort of mowing regime may help maintain perennial ryegrass in the presence of taller-statured grasses, such as orchardgrass (Kanyama-Phiri, Raguse, and Taggard, 1990).  In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> Studies in Wales indicated that there were varietal differences in yielding of cultivars of <I>Lolium perenne</I></B>, with Ba 10761 outyielding Talbot by 15% under frequent harvesting (1-2 week intervals) and 5% under infrequent harvesting (4-5 week intervals). Annual dry matter yields for the four varieties tested were for the two years of the study (across both harvesting regimes, in metric tonnes per hectare [Mg/ha]): Ba 10761: 8.29 and 8.46, Talbot: 7.77 and 7.75, Tove: 8.36 and 7.76, and S.321: 7.90 and 6.97.  Where harvesting was infrequent, dry matter yields were higher, as indicated: Ba 10761: 11.66 and 11.50, Talbot: 11.34 and 10.73, Tove: 12.27 and 10.60, and S.321: 11.61 and 9.48.  There were significant interactions between variety and harvesting frequencies.  That is, some varieties performed best under frequent harvesting, others with infrequent harvests.  However, the author suggested that it should be possible to anticipate differences in dry-matter yield under a system involving 6 cuts per year (Wilkins, 1989).<P> Perennial ryegrass sod led to reduced foliar concentration of N, S, Ca, B, and Mn in 'Chardonnay' wine grape vines.  Mowing the grass did not alleviate the competition (Tan and Crabtree, 1990).<P> Late mowing led to a greater yield (dry matter) by the early maturing variety, 'Gremie', whereas frequent mowing initiated early led to a greater yield by the late-heading variety, 'Vigor' (Taube, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>According to Munz (1973), perennial ryegrass flowers from May to September in California.  For the Kangaroo Valley cultivar complex from Australia, days to flowering (anthesis) following seedling emergence ranged from 139 (population 130b) to 156 (population 77b) (Shah et al., 1990).<P>

<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Eight- and fifteen-year-old swards of perennial ryegrass contained on average 68 kg/ha of above-ground nitrogen (stubble), 12 kg/ha of nitrogen in litter, 249 kg/ha nitrogen in root biomass, and 240 kg/ha of nitrogen in soil macro-organic matter (Whitehead et al., 1990).<P> Increased efficiency of N-uptake could have important ramifications in avoiding excess leaching of nitrates.  Studies by Wilkins and Lovatt (1989) in Wales indicate that the newest variety of perennial ryegrass, Ba 10761 gave a 20% higher yield of nitrogen than did the oldest, S.321.

However, the release of nitrogen from perennial ryegrass swards apparently takes place later in the autumn than for the other two grasses.  Thick stands of grasses (perennial ryegrass, annual ryegrass and cocksfoot [<I>Dactylis glomerata</I></B>]) are more effective at N uptake than are open stands.  Drought stress reduced N uptake by annual ryegrass more than by perennial ryegrass or cocksfoot.<P> In Germany, winter crops of rape, barley, and Welsh ryegrass respectively accumulated in their above-ground structures 52.1, 36.2, and 22.9 kg N/ha following bell bean (cv 'Alfred') (Raderschall and Gebhardt, 1990).<P> McNeill and Wood (1990) reported that in an environmental chamber with an atmosphere enriched by 15N indicated, white clover did not rapidly transfer nitrogen to associated ryegrass.

<P>
Just and humane treatment of farmworkers is an important component
of sustainable agriculture. Despite encouraging advances toward
more sustainable food and agricultural systems over the past decade,
conditions for farm laborers have declined. Two recent reports
by the California Institute for Rural Studies document and explain
this trend. <BR>
<BR>
The first report, Mixtec Migrants in California Agriculture: A
New Cycle of Poverty, examines the living and working conditions
experienced by indigenous migrants from the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
The report is derived from a detailed interview-based survey of
131 Mixtec farmworkers, as well as ethnographic field work in
both Mexico and the U.S. <BR>
<BR>
The authors estimate that 20,000 to 30,000 Mixtecs now reside
in California, representing between five and ten percent of the
agricultural labor force. Having fled their homeland due to the
economic crisis in Mexico during the early 1980s, the Mixtecs
are among the most impoverished workers in the U.S. today. The
cultural heritage of the Mixtecs poses special barriers to integration
into American society. Most Mixtecs speak neither English nor
Spanish, and are subject to racism even from other Mexican workers
due to their distinctive appearance and language. <BR>
<BR>
Because of the difficulty in defining the exact parameters of
the Mixtec farmworker community, a random sample was not employed
in this study. Instead, a &quot;snowball&quot; sample was derived
by building on initial local contacts. Since this type of sampling
is typically biased toward emphasizing specific social networks,
the authors were careful to select representatives of 41 different
Oaxaca towns. <BR>
<BR>
If anything, the sample is probably biased toward better-than-average
employment situations. The authors spoke only with those Mixtecs
who had some Spanish or English language capability, thus missing
those made particularly vulnerable to exploitation due to a language
barrier. Also, workers experiencing the worst conditions were
most likely to be inaccessible to the interviewers. <BR>
<BR>
Among the key statistical findings of the study are the following:
<BR>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Mixtec farmworkers earned less than the minimum wage in one-quarter
of the jobs in which they were employed during 1989-90, and almost
one-half had worked in at least one job paying less than minimum
wage. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Mixtecs are subject to high labor standards violations, with
over one-quarter of those interviewed reporting nonpayment of
wages on at least one occasion. 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Mixtecs are concentrated in jobs in which payments for obligatory
services such as rides to work are a condition of employment.
<BR>

<LI>Mixtecs are concentrated in jobs with short duration, and
are more migratory compared to other Mexican farmworkers. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The authors argue that Mixtecs are the latest in a historic cycle
of ethnic replacement in California farm labor Farm employers
have turned to successive groups-Chinese, Japanese, Filipino,
&quot;Okie,&quot; and mestizo Mexican workers-to maintain the
cheap labor supply on which California's agricultural economy
depends. Mixtec migrants constitute a large pool of new labor
which can be hired for lower wages. The hiring of these laborers
has the effect of undercutting gains in wages and working conditions
made possible for mestizo Mexican farmworkers during the 1970s.
As evidence, the authors cite the ten percent decline in real
wages for California farmworkers over the past decade. The authors
also provide a detailed case study of how ethnic replacement has
impacted the farm labor market for the raisin grape harvest in
the San Joaquin Valley. <BR>
<BR>
The second report, California's Agricultural Dilemma: Higher Production
and Lower Wages, is a statistical profile of how recent changes
in agricultural production have combined with immigration policies
and other forces to lower farm wages. Significant acreage increases
in fruit, vegetable and horticultural crops have increased labor
demand by some 20 percent over the past 15 years. At the same
time, economic crisis in Mexico and the 1986 immigration reform
law have dramatically increased the supply of labor Rather than
a labor shortage once feared by growers, a tremendous oversupply
of farm labor exists. This oversupply is correlated with a large
decline in real wages during the 1980s. <BR>
<BR>
Among the key findings of the report are the following: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>Hired labor accounts for at least 80% of all the work performed
on California farms. <BR>

<LI>Just one-half of the farms in California are owned and operated
by farmers. The other half are owned by individuals whose principal
occupation is something other than farming. <BR>

<LI>Wage reports submitted by employers identify about 881,000
different farmworkers in California. However, annual average employment
is much lower, since most farmworkers experience long periods
of unemployment between jobs. <BR>

<LI>At least half of all farmworker families live in poverty,
as determined by their median family income and family size standards
determined by the federal government. <BR>

</UL>

<H3>Reviewer Comments<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Both of these reports demonstrate the deteriorating conditions
for California farmworkers. Many people hoped that successful
union organizing during the 1970s would reverse the historic pattern
of the treatment of farm laborers as second class citizens. However,
events of the past 15 years have undercut the gains made at that
time and have led to conditions that in many respects are even
worse than those in the early 1970s. Future organizing efforts
will be extremely difficult given the current oversupply of labor,
and the likely prospect of continuing immigration. <BR>
<BR>
Immigration reform and more vigorous enforcement of labor regulations
are clearly needed. Ultimately, however, these are only partial
solutions. As the authors of the Mixtec report conclude, the long-term
solution must be sustainable development in Mexico, along with
sustainable rural community economic development in our own state.
In the emerging global economy the structural ties linking rural
Mexico and rural California are increasingly evident. Given our
shared fate, it will be critical to sustain vital communities
by promoting locally-controlled development projects both here
and in Mexico. The work of Mixtec self-help organizations, described
in the CIRS report, provides one model of how this vital work
is beginning. <BR>
<BR>
Both reports can be ordered from the California Institute for
Rural Studies, P.O. Box 2143, Davis, CA 95617, (916) 7566555.
The Mixtec migrant report is $12.50, plus $4.00 for shipping and
handling; the second report is $7.50, plus $1.50 for shipping
and handling. <BR>

&quot;Results of a literature survey [234 references] indicate
that weed population density and biomass production may be markedly
reduced using crop rotation (temporal diversification) and intercropping
(spatial diversification) strategies. Crop rotation resulted in
emerged weed densities in test crops that were lower in 21 cases,
higher in 1 case, and equivalent in 5 cases in comparison to monoculture
systems [see Table 1]. In 12 cases where weed seed density was
reported, seed density in crop rotation was lower in 9 cases and
equivalent in 3 cases when compared to monocultures of the component
crops. In intercropping systems where a main crop was intersown
with a &quot;smother&quot; crop species, weed biomass in the intercrop
was lower in 47 cases and higher in 4 cases than in the main crop
grown alone (as a sole crop); a variable response was observed
in 3 cases. When intercrops were composed of two or more main
crops, weed biomass in the intercrop was lower than in all of
the component sole crops in 12 cases, intermediate between component
sole crops in 10 cases, and higher than all sole crops in 2 cases.
It is unclear why crop rotation studies have focused on weed density,
whereas intercropping studies have focused on weed biomass.<BR>

<P>
&quot;The success of rotation systems for weed suppression appears
to be based on the use of crop sequences that create varying patterns
of resource competition, allelopathic interference, soil disturbance,
and mechanical damage to provide an unstable and frequently inhospitable
environment that prevents the proliferation of a particular weed
species. The relative importance and most effective combinations
of these weed control tactics have not been adequately assessed.
In addition, the weed-suppressive effects of other related factors,
such as manipulation of soil fertility dynamics in rotation sequences,
need to be examined.<BR>

<P>
&quot;Intercrops may demonstrate weed control advantages over
sole crops in two ways. First, greater crop yield and less weed
growth may be achieved if intercrops are more effective than sole
crops in usurping resources from weeds or suppressing weed growth
through allelopathy. Alternatively, intercrops may provide yield
advantages without suppressing weed growth below levels observed
in component sole crops if intercrops use resources that are not
exploitable by weeds or convert resources to harvestable material
more efficiently than sole crops. Because of the difficulty of
monitoring the use of multiple resources by intercrop/weed mixtures
throughout the growing season, identification of specific mechanisms
of weed suppression and yield enhancement in intercrop systems
has so far proven elusive.<BR>

<P>
&quot;Significant advances in the design and improvement of weed-suppressive
crop rotation and intercropping systems most likely to occur if
three important areas of research are addressed. First, there
must be continued attention to the study of weed population dynamics
and crop-weed interference in crop rotation and intercropping
systems. More information is needed concerning the effects of
diversification of cropping systems on weed seed longevity, weed
seedling emergence, weed seed production and dormancy, agents
of weed mortality, differential resource consumption by crops
and weeds, and allelopathic interactions. Second, there needs
to by systematic manipulation of specific components of rotation
and intercropping systems to isolate and improve those elements
(e.g., interrow cultivation, choice of crop genotype) or combinations
of elements that may be especially important for weed control.
Finally, the weed-related impacts of combining crop rotation and
intercropping strategies should be assessed through careful study
of extant, complex farming systems and the design and testing
of new integrated approaches.<BR>

<P>
&quot;Many aspects of crop rotation and intercropping are compatible
with current farming practices and could become more accessible
to farmers if government policies are restructured to reflect
the true environmental costs of agricultural production.&quot;

93P-1. 1993.<BR>

<I>The California Water Plan Update.  Vol. / and /1.</I>
<P>
California Department of Water Resources, Draft Bulletin 160-93.
1993.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Two recent state reports raise disturbing questions about the
sustainability of California agriculture in the face of population
growth and water scarcity.<BR>

<P>
<I>Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity for California and
its Counties 1990-2040.  </I>The Demographic Research Unit of
the California Department of Finance predicts that the state's
population will reach 63 million by the year 2040, more than double
the current 29 million.  Prime agricultural land is particularly
threatened by the concentration of new growth in the Central Valley,
where the total population will triple to more than 15 million.
 Many of the state's most productive agricultural counties are
slated to grow at more than double the 2.26 percent rate for the
state as a whole.<BR>

<P>
Assuming current residential density patterns, a Central Valley
population of 15 million would consume another 1 million acres
of productive valley floor agricultural land, resulting in a potential
loss to the agricultural economy of $1.267 billion dollars, measured
in 1990 dollars.  Indirect economic losses on non-farm industries
would make this figure even higher.<BR>

<P>
<I>The California Water Plan Update.  Vol.  I and II.  </I>Confirmation
of this stark economic prospect for agriculture can be found in
the new water budget developed by the California Department of
Water Resources.  For the first time, this budget admits that
total demand for water will outstrip supplies by the year 2020.
 The question becomes, how will the limited water supply be distributed
among agricultural, urban and environmental interests?<BR>

<P>
According to DWR, agriculture's share of the total water supply
will <B>decrease</B> over the next 30 years, while urban and environmental
uses will increase.  The calculations use 1990 as the base year,
and include water from all sources (i.e., including groundwater
and rivers in addition to water projects), The 1990 figures show
that agriculture uses about 42 percent of the state's water supplies
(rather than the 80 percent figure more commonly cited which represents
agriculture's share of developed water supplies from the state
and federal water projects only).  Net urban demand is 11 percent,
environmental demand 44 percent and miscellaneous uses 3 percent.
<BR>

<P>
By 2020 agriculture's share of the total state water supply will
drop from 42 percent to 38 percent, while the urban share increases
from 11 percent to 16 percent (an increase of 57 percent over
1990 levels).  Environmental demand, measured for the first time
by DWR in this report, will remain at 44 percent.  This category
includes existing in-stream flow requirements, wild and scenic
river flows, Bay-Delta protection requirements, fishery requirements,
and supplies for managed freshwater wetlands.<BR>

<P>
For agriculture, these numbers suggest a decline in agricultural
water use of approximately 1.9 million acre-feet in an average
year.  Where will this decline come from? According to the report,
the bulk of the decrease in agricultural water use will come from
a permanent retirement of 400,000 acres of agricultural land (by
2020) on which new urban development will take place.  Another
45,000 acres of land with drainage problems due to selenium problems
is also expected to be retired.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
The evidence from these two reports evokes a disturbing picture
for agriculture in California's Great Central Valley.  Do we really
want a future in which one can drive the highway 99 corridor from
Sacramento to Fresno without any sense of being in an agricultural
region? What changes will be required so that the predictions
from these reports do not become a self-fulfilling prophecy?<BR>

<P>
It is apparent that California agriculture faces a precipitous
decline unless a new covenant is forged between urban and agricultural
interests.  From the urban community, we need a commitment to
rational planning processes that permanently protect prime agricultural
soils and take growth management seriously.  From the agricultural
community, we need a transition to agricultural practices that
preserve environmental quality and are compatible with sites on
the fringes of residential areas.<BR>

<P>
Sustainable agriculture can play a critical role in helping agriculture
make these needed changes.  By enabling farmers to reduce chemical
use (and still remain profitable), it can dramatically reduce
agriculture's contribution to non-point source water pollution.
 This in turn will increase the supply of clean water available
for urban and environmental uses.  By reducing or eliminating
chemical applications, and by improving soil quality, it can reduce
agriculture's contribution of dust and chemicals to particulate
pollution.  Furthermore, farms that use fewer chemicals will be
considered better neighbors to urban areas.  This can help expand
political support for agriculture among urban residents.  The
emphasis in sustainable agriculture on direct marketing, farmers'
markets, composting businesses and other direct economic ties
between local farmers and their communities can enhance this support.
<BR>

<P>
Ultimately, the future of agriculture in California's Central
Valley will require a new vision of the integral relationship
between agriculture and community life.  Perhaps the greatest
contribution of sustainable agriculture to California's future
is its attempt, however imperfect, to offer alternatives to the
status quo for family farms, rural communities, farmworkers, consumers
and others involved in our food system.  Out of a new dialogue
between urban and rural California lies the promise that agriculture
may yet have a healthy future in this state.<BR>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This plant has been called sour clover (Madson, 1951; Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982), sourclover (Duke, 1981), bitter melilot (McLeod, 1982), annual yellow clover (McLeod, 1982), bitter clover (Nelson, 1922; McLeod, 1982), King Island melilot (McLeod, 1982), Indian sweetclover (Duke, 1981), and senji (Duke, 1981).<P> <I>Melilotus</I></B> spp. are not true clovers (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Melilotus indicus</I></B> (L.) All.  (Munz, 1973); <I>Melilotus indica</I></B> (L.) All (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>This is an erect, stemmy plant similar in its habit of growth to other sweet clovers; it shows moderate density of growth (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Sourclover is an annual (Madson, 1951; Nelson, 1922) plant that is self pollinated (Duke, 1981).  Seed is sown from September through November and harvested for forage from February to April, when plants are in full flower (Duke, 1981).  Munz (1973) listed the flowering period in California as being from April through October.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described this species as an annual herb with erect stems up to 50 cm tall, branching, sparingly pilose, leaves trifoliate, stipules often with a small tooth near base; petioles up to 2 cm long, rachis about 5 mm long, 9 mm wide, coarsely toothed; rounded at the apex; racemes many flowered, up to 10 cm long, including peduncle up to 3 cm long; bracts subulate, ca. 0.5 mm long; pedicels ca.  1 mm long, reflexed after flowering; calyx ca 1.5 mm; corolla yellow, ca 2.5 mm long; style 0.9-1.2 mm long; pod 3-4 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, one-seeded, with prominent reticulate veins.<P> Munz (1973) described the species as follows: Stems erect, 2-8 dm high, glabrous or +/- appressed pubescent; petioles commonly 0.5-2 cm long; stupules lance-subulate, 4-6 mm long; leaflets cuneate-oblanceolate to -obovate, 1-3 cm long, obtuse or truncate, denticulate; racemes 2-10 cm long, including the peduncles; pods ovoid, reticulate, glabrous, 1.5-2 cm long.<P> This erect, stemmy plant bears small yellow flowers in short, dense racemes (Madson, 1951).  The stalk is woody (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Various estimates of height are presented: A few inches to several feet depending on environment (Madson, 1951); a maximum height of about 50 cm (Duke, 1981); and 20-80 cm (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Sour clover has a much more extensive root system than vetch or pea.  Six months after planting, tap roots were found to a depth of eight feet (Nelson, 1922).  Therefore, sourclover is believed valuable for opening up heavy soils (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Sourclover originated in the Hindustani Center of Diversity, and ranges from the Cool Temperate Steppe to Wet through Subtropical Dry Forest Life Zone; it is native to the Mediterranean Region south to Ethiopia, and to Central Asia and India (Duke, 1981). Sourclover is often a weed in North America, in the Sonoran zone from Oregon south to Baja California, Mexico (Duke, 1981).  Munz (1973) wrote that it is common in low-elevational waste places in most of California.<P> Sourclover is most valuable from central California south.  In the northern half of the state, cold winters preclude satisfactory growth.  It has been used extensively in southern California, particularly in orchards (Madson, 1951).<P> McLeod (1982) stated that this species can be grown anywhere in the U.S., and that it does especially well in the Southwest.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed was formerly abundant and cheap (Madson, 1951) but has been unavailable in the trade from 1989 through 1992 (Cantisano, pers. comm.; Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Sourclover seed yields are only about 250 kg/ha in India (Duke, 1981), but McLeod (1982) stated that the species is a heavy seed producer.  Seed is easy to produce where the species is adapted (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Sourclover does well in a wide range of soil types, but it does best on well-drained neutral or alkaline soils of medium to high fertility (Duke, 1981).  Madson (1951.) recommended loam to heavy soil types, whereas Nelson (1922) stated that growth was best on sandy loams, although a wide variety of soils are suitable.  McLeod (1982) wrote that almost any soil is suitable, but loams are best; the deep, large taproot was credited with the ability to break up heavy soils.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Madson (1951) listed seed cost as low.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sourclover should be seeded from September through November (Duke, 1981). In California, seeding should be from October to November (Madson, 1951).  In southern California, it should be sown by October 15th to be ready for incorporation by March (McLeod, 1982).<P> According to Nelson's (1922) account, in orchards where spring plowing is done in February or March, sow by September 15th. Where adequate water for irrigation is available and late spring plowing is practiced, December 1 sowings may suffice.  In dry-farmed fruit culture, seed after the first fall rains, and do not allow continued cover crop growth in spring after the free water in the soil has been exhausted.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Sourclover has been said to be frost tolerant and withstands mean annual temperatures of 7.2-22.5 C, with a mean of 18 cases of 14.8 C (Duke, 1981). Madson (1951) credited the species with moderate cold resistance, and McLeod (1982) stated that it withstands frost better than either common vetch or Canadian field pea, yet is not winter hardy.  It grows well during the winter in southern California, San Joaquin, Sacramento Valleys, and in other areas suitable for alfalfa where the minimum temperature does not go below about 18 F (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates recommended include 20-25 lb/a (Nelson, 1922), 40-50 kg.  ha (Duke, 1981), 10 to 15 lbs/acre (McLeod, 1982), and 15 to 25 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989).<P> 2-25% of the seed may be hard and will not germinate the first year (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Sourclover has served as a green manure and cover crop in the orchards of southern and central California, particularly citrus (McLeod, 1982).<P> By 1922, sourclover was recognized as one of the leading winter cover crops for California (Nelson, 1922), and in tests by the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of California at Riverside, it out-yielded common vetch and Canadian field pea, the two legumes most commonly grown for winter green-manure crops.  It is also was widely successfully as a summer cover crop, and the Agricultural Extension Service encouraged its use.<P> Sourclover was used extensively in southern California, particularly in orchards but was replaced by bare chemical fallow. Sour clover was easy to grow where adapted, and seed was abundant and cheap (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Sourclover is used for reclaiming saline areas (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Sourclover cultivar 'Fo.  S.I.' yields nearly 10 MT/ha in green forage, and overall sourclover biomass yields are 4.5-7.5 MT/ha in India (Duke, 1981).<P> Experiments conducted in southern California showed that Sourclover outyields common vetch and Canadian field pea (McLeod, 1982).<P> Nelson (1922) stated that above-ground biomass production compares well with that of any of the green-manure crops tested in California.  Yields of green matter average about ten tons per acre under favorable conditions.  In a test vineyard in Fresno County, more than forty tons per acre were obtained, but such yields are unusual.  Yields are occasionally much below average.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Unlike those of its congeneric relatives white and yellow sweetclover, sourclover blossoms does not attract nectarivorous predatory and parasitic insects (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Sourclover is resistant to aphids (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Sourclover tolerates a pH range of 5.0-8.2, with a mean of 6.8 for the 17 cases assessed; the species is said to tolerate alkali, high pH, and limestone (Duke, 1981) and to have a high lime requirement (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Sow at a depth of 1/2 inch (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed remains viable for a relatively long period of time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Sourclover requires type "A" <I>Rhizobium</I></B> for inoculation (same as for alfalfa) (Duke, 1981).<P> Nelson (1922) recounted that sourclover grew well all over California, requiring inoculation only on soils farmed without legumes for many years.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>In the first few weeks of growth, sourclover closely resembles alfalfa (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Sourclover tolerates annual precipitation of 0.9-12.9 dm, with the mean of 18 cases being 7.6 dm (Duke, 1981).  After sowing, irrigation should be immediate and be repeated 7-10 days later; sourclover can be sown into standing water; 2-3 irrigations are sufficient for the crop (Duke, 1981).  It has a heavy, succulent foliage, and a high water requirement (Nelson, 1922).<P> In dry-farmed fruit culture, do not allow souclover to continue growth in spring after exhaustion of free water in the soil (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The seed of this variety closely resembles that of alfalfa, and care should be exercised to see that it is free from seed of noxious weed pests.  In 1922, much of the seed was obtained from screenings of wheat; such seed should be carefully recleaned.  In many cases from five to twenty percent of the seed proves to be hard and will not germinate the first year (Nelson, 1922).<P> Sourclover has a high proportion of hard seed, and there are from 250,00-275,000 seeds/lb (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Sourclover seed requires scarification prior to sowing because there is a high proportion of hard seed; the seedbed should have a fine tilth (Duke, 1981).<P> Sow on the dry soil mulch in orchards rather than in moist soil just after irrigation, as is a common practice for peas and vetches.  Where furrow irrigation is used, furrows should be sufficiently close to completely wet the soil surface; otherwise, a poor stand may result.  Irrigation after seeding usually firms the soil enough to insure good germination.  The seed bed should be prepared as for alfalfa, and the seed either broadcasted or drilled.  After planting, the soil should be firmed over the seed sufficiently to insure an ample supply of moisture for proper germination (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Sourclover does best with about 200 lbs of superphosphate per acre at seeding.  Fertilizers are often unnecessary (Nelson, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Nelson (1922) indicated that the stage at which the crop should be incorporated depends on soil type and moisture supply. On heavy soils, aeration is crucial and sourclover is best incorporated when it is mature and bulky.  Thorough incorporation is important to facilitate breakdown.  With dry soils, irrigate immediately after plow-down, to reduce drought stress to orchard trees.  In annual farming systems, allow two to four weeks to elapse before planting successive cash crops.<P> Nelson's (1922) account indicated that when cover cropping twice in immediate succession on medium to light-textured soils, both cover crops may be disked in.  Deep placement of residue is not so important for decomposition if the surface is shaded during the summer months as it is under clean culture.  On heavy (clayey) soils, deep incorporation of residue is best. Decomposition requires from two to four weeks and is fastest in light-textured (sandy) soils.  Inadequate soil moisture can delay decomposition two or three months or even longer.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Nelson (1922) found that sour clover improves heavy soils physically and increases the water-holding capacity of all soils. It retains moisture in the fertile surface strata, thus sustaining soil life.  The deep taproot and extensive root system penetrate into the subsoil and relieve plow pan, which is common in orchards. In orchards frequently cover cropped with tap-rooted plants, water penetration is greatly improved.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Sourclover tolerates 3-6 mmhos of salinity or 5-8 in gypsiferous soils (Duke, 1981).<P> Maranon et al.  (1989) found that salinity tolerance during germination was directly related to seed weight in three species of annual <I>Melilotus</I></B> spp.  from the Guadalquivir delta in Spain. The rank order was <I>M. messanensis</I></B> > <I>M. segetalis</I></B> > <I>M.  indica</I></B> (sourclover). Within-species differences were also found among several populations of <I>M. segetalis</I></B> and <I>M. indica</I></B>, which was related to the habitat of the mother plant.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Sourclover requires about 150 days to enter full flower (Duke, 1981), and Munz (1973) listed flowering in California as occurring from April through October.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Sourclover may require some initial weeding; it is often grown in mixture with barley or oat, which are sometimes used as weed-suppressive nurse crops with other legumes (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Sourclover can be mowed 2-4 times and is harvested from February - April in India (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Sourclover is often used in mixes with barley or oat (Duke, 1981), and Young (1922) reported a cover crop of sourclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B>, 30 lb/a) mixed with rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>, 10 lb/a) and some purple vetch (<I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B>) grown in a citrus orchard.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Sourclover hay contains 3.36% N (Duke, 1981).  Projecting from the 4.5-7.5 Mg/ha and 10 Mg/ha biomass figures given above, this translates to 151-252 kg N/ha and 336 kg N/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Sourclover hay contains 0.49% P2O2, 1.5% K2O, and 2.49% CaO (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) discussed the use and potential problems of sourclover as cattle feed.  In the Southwest, sourclover is less productive and palatable than 'Hubam' annual white sweetclover. Sourclover is used as green forage for cattle and cows, and as a maintenance ration for heifers; it is also grown for silage .  As green feed, the analysis is 3.3% protein, 78.4% moisture, 6.4% fiber, and 14.4% total digestible nutrients.  As silage, there is 2.1% protein, 70.2% moisture, 14.1% total digestible nutrients. As hay, the analysis indicates 18.6% protein, 10% moisture, and 23.8% crude fiber.  If sourclover is cut before bloom and used for feed, bloat is more likely than if it is cut during flowering.  Chopped forage should be fed in mixtures with other dry forage.  If sourclover is fed alone or in excess to cattle, it can cause health problems such as lethargy, tympanitis, and paralysis, and taint the milk.  Coumarin is a chemical imparting the bitter flavor to sourclover, but low-coumarin varieties are available.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>Young (1922) conducted an unreplicated study upon which have been based many subsequent generalizations about cover-crop effect on temperatures in citrus groves.  A 6-acre grove was divided into 2, 3-acre sections.  A cover crop of sourclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B>, 30 lb/a) mixed with rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>, 10 lb/a) and some purple vetch (<I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B>) was established. Locations of two temperature stations were assigned based on similarity of low temperatures when dense cover crops were present in both sections.  On January 18, 1922, the northern half of the orchard was ploughed, but the cover crop in the southern half was left intact.  Conditions were wet during this study.  Temperature measurements were made for 16 nights of frost, including the exceptionally-cold spell from Januay 19-23, which included the coldest weather in southern California since 1913.  Sheltered thermometers showed that 10 inches above the ground, the cover-cropped plot was, on average, approximately 2 degrees F colder than the clean-cultivated plot during the night.  The only effect at 5 feet above ground was to decrease the rate of temperature rise during the morning. Unsheltered thermometers showed that depression of minimum temperatures was about 2.4 degrees F at 7 inches above the ground, and 0.4 degrees F at 24 inches above the ground.  At times when air temperatures were falling rapidly, the temperature at 7 inches could be as much as 11 degrees colder in the cover-cropped plot.  The results suggest that cover crops do increase the risk of frost, but only slightly.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), some cultivars of sourclover have low coumarin concentrations; 'Fo. S. I.' was mentioned as having especially great biomass production (nearly 10 Mg/ha).<P>

<I>Pimentel, D., D. Andow, R. Dyson-Hudson, D. Gallahan, S. Jacobson,
M. Irish, S. Kroop, A. Moss, I. Schreiner, M. Shepard, T.  Thompson
and B. Vinzant<BR>
</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In Pimentel, D., (ed.)<I> Handbook of Pest Management
in Agriculture, </I>Vol.1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL. pp.679-718.

<P>
Can pesticide use be reduced without substantial increases in
food costs? This is the question David Pimentel addresses in new
research published in the 1991 edition of the <I>Handbook of Pest
Management in Agriculture.  </I>A condensed version of the same
article appears in the June 1991 edition of BioScience (pp.402-409).
<BR>
<P>
Pimentel concludes that a 50 percent reduction in pesticide use
can be achieved with a total price increase in purchased food
of only 0.6 percent.  The reduction in pesticide use would involve
&quot;substituting currently available biological, cultural, and
environmental pest-control technologies for some current pesticide
control practices.&quot;  Because this conclusion undercuts the
argument that pesticides are necessary to keep consumer food costs
low, it is being cited frequently by advocates of sustainable
agriculture.<BR>
<H3>Methodology</H3>
<P>
Pimentel begins by noting that farmers spend approximately $4.1
billion on pesticides annually.  They justify this high cost by
a direct dollar return of from $3 to $5 for every $1 spent on
pesticides.  This cost ratio does not include the indirect costs
of pesticide use on human and environmental health, nor does it
take into account evolved pesticide resistance or the creation
of secondary pest problems.  Because calculating the costs of
these indirect costs is extremely complex, it is difficult to
calculate the net benefit to farmers or to society of pesticide
use. (For one such methodology, see the review of<I> Paying the
Farm Bill</I> in<I> Components, 2(3), Summer 1991, pp. 1-3.)<BR>
</I>
<P>
Pimentel's objective is to document whether a 5O percent reduction
in pesticide use can be achieved without yield decreases due to
increased crop losses to pests.  He admits that obtaining accurate
crop loss data is difficult.  Experimental field tests often exaggerate
crop loss because assessments of insect, weed, and disease losses
are carried out separately and then combined.  (Using this approach
one study found a total crop loss on untreated apples of more
than 140 percent!)  In other cases, data simply do not exist and
must be extrapolated from closely related crops.  With these limitations
in mind, Pimentel characterizes his effort as a &quot;first approximation&quot;
and calls for better data collection in the future.<BR>
<P>
To arrive at his conclusion, Pimentel looks at 40 major crops,
concentrating on two crops for each type of chemical: corn and
cotton for insecticide use, apples and potatoes for fungicides,
and corn and soybeans for herbicides.  For each crop he considers
the alternative pest control strategies already available for
the crop, their cost comparison with pesticide use, and any impact
they have on crop yields.  He then calculates the total percentage
decrease in pesticide use possible and the effect of this decrease
on the cost of production.<BR>
<P>
Improved monitoring and application equipment alone account for
much of the total reduction Pimentel believes is possible.  For
example, he notes that fungicide use on apples could be reduced
10 percent by monitoring and better forecasting of disease based
on weather data, and another 10 percent by employing a recent
design in spray nozzle and application equipment.<BR>
<P>
By totaling the combined reductions made possible by substituting
non-chemical alternatives on 40 major crops, Pimentel argues that
a 50 percent reduction in agricultural pesticide use can be obtained
in the near future.  The total cost of implementing the alternatives
is estimated to be approximately $1 billion.  This would increase
total pest control costs by approximately 25 percent, while increasing
total food production costs at the farm by 0.6 percent.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>
<P>
The data limitations facing Pimentel (or any other researcher
in this field) make it difficult to grant conclusions much validity.
 The 0.6 percent figure Pimentel reports suggests a degree of
precision that Pimentel himself is quick to dismiss in the article.
 Advocates of sustainable agriculture should be careful to treat
Pimentel's work not as a definitive but a suggestive statement.
<BR>
<P>
On the other hand, Pimentel's conclusion is consistent with previous
studies indicating that pesticide bans or reductions would increase
annual food costs to consumers by less than 10 percent.  Many
consumers would be willing to pay these additional costs, especially
if they were understood as simultaneously decreasing the social,
environmental, health, and political costs associated with pesticide
use.<BR>
<P>
Two deeper issues are not addressed in Pimentel's research.  One
is the fact that food prices are largely determined by processors,
wholesalers and retailers, <U>after</U> food leaves the farm gate.
Pimentel's work erroneously implies a direct link between on farm
production costs and the price the consumer pays for food.<BR>
<P>
The second issue is that pesticide reduction strategies inevitably
impact much more than the practices of farmers or the price of
food.  Pesticide use is linked to a broad range of social, economic,
and political issues, among them: government policies to promote
cheap food and export earnings; the growth of large agribusiness
entities through which farmers could (from the same company) purchase
various farm inputs and supplies, obtain advice and recommendations,
and in some cases, market their product; the sources farmers trust
for information; and, farmers' predisposition to avoid risk. 
 These broader issues must be examined to fully understand the
root causes of pesticide use and abuse.<BR>

<H1>Improving Soil Quality in Annual Crops = Better Production
</H1>
<P>
A group of 40 row and field crop farmers met with extension specialists
at the Kearney Agricultural Center in Parlier November 28 to discuss
current information on ecologically sound soil management for
annual cropping systems. The theme was <I>Enhancing Soil Quality
for Successful Production.  <BR>
</I>
<P>
Soil quality characteristics addressed at the workshop included:
structure, tilth, soil-water relationships, weed management, and
soil fertility. Highlights of the meeting follow.<BR>
<H3>Organic Matter</H3>
<P>
Tillage and crop residue management were highlighted in presentations
by <B>Lloyd Elliott</B>, director of the USDA Cotton Research
Station, Shafter and <B>Jim Rumsey</B>, assistant professor of
agricultural engineering at UC Davis. Elliott emphasized the importance
of increasing organic matter content and enhancing the activity
of beneficial microorganisms that break down organic matter. He
said they are the keys to improving water infiltration and nutrient
cycling. High levels of soil organic matter have also been shown
to improve the crop's ability to resist various pest problems,
Elliot said.  Two major factors may limit row and field crop production
under higher organic matter levels: 1) the lack of environmentally
sound weed control methods; and 2) the need for better equipment
and implements that allow for planting into crop residues and
a rougher seed bed.<BR>
<H3>Low-Till</H3>
<P>
Minimum tillage is a specific practice that has been show to enhance
soil organic matter levels and soil tilth. Rumsey defined it as
the minimum soil manipulation necessary for crop production or
for meeting tillage requirements under the existing soil conditions.
Some of the primary reasons farmers make use of minimum tillage
include: 1) reducing runoff and soil erosion; 2) conserving soil
moisture; and 3) saving money through reduction of energy and/or
labor inputs in tillage. Rumsey said research on field corn and
processing tomatoes at the UC Davis Student Experimental Farm
is developing useful information for row crop farmers. The number
of field operations were reduced from eight to two in field corn,
and from eight to three in processing tomatoes. Some of the preliminary
conclusions drawn from two years of data are shown in the following
table. More information is required in order to assess the effects
of minimum tillage on insects, diseases, and soil fertility, Rumsey
said.<BR>

<H3>Water-Soil Balance</H3>
<P>
Research has shown that irrigation practices must be adapted to
the changing soil conditions as growers work to modify soil structure
and improve infiltration rates. <B>Blaine Hanson</B>, a UC Davis
extension irrigation specialist, presented some of the key principles
in improving irrigation efficiency in annual cropping systems.
Irrigation efficiency is defined as the beneficial use of water
divided by the applied water. A high irrigation efficiency means
that losses of water are minimal. The resulting benefits of high
irrigation efficiencies include: 1) reduced water costs; 2) reduced
pumping costs; 3) better retention of mobile plant nutrients within
the root zone; and 4) protection of ground water supplies due
to less deep percolation of chemicals through soil profile.<BR>
<P>
In practical terms, the key to high irrigation efficiencies is
<I>uniformity</I> of water application, Hanson said. Uniformity
refers to the evenness with which water is applied throughout
a field. The uniformity of surface irrigation systems can be improved
by: 1) reducing the length of the irrigation run; 2) adjusting
the furrow inflow rate; 3) creating a smoother furrow surface
for water to move along; and 4) implementing a surge flow program
whereby the flow of water at a particular furrow is intermittent
instead of continuous. Knowing application and infiltration rates
for a particular field are essential for obtaining highest efficiencies.
The best technology available to growers for determining appropriate
application rates is to manually probe the soil to monitor what
is happening in the soil profile, Hanson said.<BR>
<P>
The uniformity of sprinkler irrigation systems can be improved
by: 1) maintaining uniform pressure throughout the sprinkler system;
2) repairing all leaks; 3) maintaining a uniform nozzle size;
and 4) avoiding irrigation on windy days.<BR>
<H3>Subsurface Drip Irrigation</H3>
<P>
<B>Larry Schwankl</B>, a UC Davis extension irrigation specialist,
discussed subsurface drip irrigation in row crop production. A
summary of advantages and disadvantages follows.<BR>
<P>
<I>Advantages. </I>1) Uniform water application when properly
designed and maintained. 2) Reduced labor requirements compared
to conventional surface irrigation system. 3) Increased efficiency
of water and chemical use due to direct delivery to crop root
zone. 4) Maintenance of a dry soil surface allows for access to
field at all times and reduced weed growth. <I>5) </I>Irrigation
effectiveness is not influenced by poor surface infiltration characteristics.
 6) Documented yield increases for some crops and locations.<BR>
<P>
<I>Disadvantages. </I>1) Installation and removal of buried drip
systems can be both difficult and expensive (reported costs as
high as $400/acre.) 2) Depending on water quality, proper maintenance
and operation of a subsurface drip system may require sophisticated
filtration systems plus chlorine and/or acid treatments to prevent
clogging of drip lines. 3) Difficult to detect and repair leaks
and clogging. 4) Subsurface drip systems require qualified and
extensive management. <I>5) </I>Potential problems with germination
and stand establishment for some crops.   6) Initially high capital
costs ($1,000/acre or more depending on manufacturer) may prohibit
use in some crops.<BR>
<P>
An economic assessment should also take into account the life
of the lateral drip lines, usually about five to seven years.
Most California growers, however, feel they would need to get
back into the field within three to five years for deep ripping,
Schwankl noted.<BR>
<H3>Weed Control</H3>
<P>
Weeds are one potentially limiting factor for growers making use
of minimum tillage and other low-input practices to enhance soil
quality. <B>Tom Lanini</B>, a UC Davis extension weed ecologist,
presented several low-input and non-chemical options for vegetable
crop growers. Lanini stressed the importance of balancing a number
of weed control practices rather than relying on one single control
method. General approaches should include cultivation, biological
control, mulches of various kinds, and capitalizing on the crop's
ability to compete, he said.<BR>
<P>
Living mulches block light, compete directly with weeds and may
be allelopathic (suppress weeds with release of toxic substances)
depending on the particular species used. Lanini summarized recently
published work on subclover and other living mulches (see <I>California
Agriculture, </I>November/December 1989).<BR>
<P>
Cultivation is probably the most widely used method of weed control,
Lanini noted. It is possible to enhance the effectiveness of cultivation
by scheduling cultivations according to the crop's ability to
compete with problem weeds. Lanini said studies conducted over
the past three years showed that field bindweed could be effectively
controlled in processing tomatoes with two cultivations conducted
at approximately three and six weeks from planting. A general
rule of thumb for controlling annual weeds in vegetable crops
is to insure two to ten weeks of weed-free conditions after crop
emergence to obtain profitable yields, he said. The specific length
of time depends on the rate of crop growth and the time of year.
Lanini described the lengths of time for weed-free conditions
required by several other vegetable crops. Times are shown below:

<P>
<H3>Soil Fertility</H3>
<P>
As growers look at alternative soil management strategies, some
of the key questions they ask center on soil fertility: How can
farmers maintain adequate levels of soil fertility? Are organic
sources of nutrients sufficient to meet the nutrient needs of
their specific crops? Are cover crops or green manures really
feasible for individual farmers' production systems?  Can an individual
farmer maintain adequate fertility levels in his/her soil and
not contaminate groundwater?<BR>
<P>
These were some of the questions addressed by three speakers at
the workshop. <B>Stuart Pettygrove</B>, UC Davis extension soils
specialist, presented important principles for using manure and
compost. The cumulative effects of manure applications on soil
properties include: 1) improved permeability; 2) resistance to
compaction; 3) increased water holding capacity; and 4) decreased
surface crusting. It is difficult to assign a dollar value to
these particular benefits, Pettygrove said. Nutrient values are
easier to assign, but there are a number of considerations that
complicate the actual management of nutrients, particularly nitrogen.
Pettygrove said the four compounding factors are: 1) the water
content of the manure; 2) the actual nitrogen content of the material;
3) the nitrogen availability; and 4) the method of application.
All these will ultimately influence the nitrogen contribution
made by the manure, he said. Though the decay series (nitrogen
release rates over time) is an important concept for manure management,
it should not be regarded as an accurate management tool, Pettygrove
said. The biological process of organic matter breakdown makes
nitrogen rates too variable and unpredictable, he said. Tighter
nutrient management can be achieved through the use of compost
containing more stable nitrogen compounds available to the crop
over time, he added.<BR>
<H3>Cover Crops</H3>
<P>
Growers heard <B>Rick Miller</B>, a UC Davis postgraduate agronomy
researcher, discuss the use of cover crops in annual production
systems. He talked about four years use of cover crops at the
UC Davis Student Experimental Farm where he has been growing them
in conjunction with field corn and processing tomatoes. Cover
crop selection and management in annual cropping systems is described
extensively by Miller in <I>Covercrops for California Agriculture,
</I>published by the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources
(publication 21471, see <B>Cover Crops</B>, p.2 to order.)<BR>
<P>
UC Davis extension soils specialist <B>Roland Meyer</B> said sufficient
levels of nitrogen can be supplied to crops while maintaining
groundwater quality. Accomplishing this requires an approach to
fertility management that combines: 1) knowing the amount of nitrogen
removed in the harvested portion of the crop being grown; 2) an
assessment of the nitrogen supply capabilities of an individual
farmer's soil; and 3) appropriate applications of fertilizer nitrogen
where needed along with sound irrigation management practices.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Gabe Bethlenfalvay</B>, a soil ecologist with the USDA-Agricultural
Research Service in Albany, presented soil quality issues at a
more technical level. Research by Bethlenfalvay and others shows
the importance of beneficial soil fungi (mycorrhizae) in enhancing
soil structure and improving nutrient and water transfer from
the soil solution to the growing crop. Though the significance
of mycorrhizae is well-known, there is still much to be done to
improve them and their management in an agricultural setting,
Bethlenfalvay said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Allan Fulton</B>, Kings County farm advisor, reminded the audience
that information discussed at the workshop can be used to help
solve specific San Joaquin Valley soil problems including clay
pans, hard pans, saline soils, wind erosion, nutritional problems,
water infiltration, perched (high) water tables, pathogens, and
nematodes. Fulton said the challenge to San Joaquin Valley farmers
and researchers is determining how to integrate different soil
management practices, and understanding the ramifications of <I>any
</I>changes to other aspects of a cropping system. <BR>

<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Bur medic is an winter annual herb, semierect or prostrate (Duke, 1981).  Habit is trailing prostrate or erect, depending on plant density (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  Density of growth is light (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Seed should be sown in late summer (Duke, 1981) or fall (Duke, 1981; Finch and Sharp, 1983), with October-November recommended by Madson (1951).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>This species is cultivated in dry warm temperate regions of the world, is not frost tolerant, and tolerates mean annual temperatures of from 10.5 to 27.5 degrees C (Duke, 1981).  It has been called moderately resistant to cold (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates are variously given as 9 lbs/acre (Finch and Sharp, 1983), 13.3 lbs/acre (Duke, 1981), 15 to 20 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989), and 20 to 30 lbs/acre (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name is <I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> L.  (Duke, 1981; Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Cv 'Serena' is very early maturing, whereas cv 'Circle Valley' is a medium-season type (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Cv 'Circle Valley' can form large quantities of seed (in excess of 1 Mg/ha.) provided there is adequate soil moisture and nutrients are adequate (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> The burrs of 'Serena' have a higher proportion of seed (by weight) than do species such as barrel and disc medics which have thick-walled burrs.  The seed yield of 'Serena' was higher than that of cyprus barrel medic or 'Harbinger' strand medic and comparable to that of 'Tornafield' disc medic in sward trials at Perth (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Bur medic is the best known plant among the medics (Murphy et al., 1976). The plant branches profusely at the base, and the stems are decumbent and attain a height of about 6 to 10 inches (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  There are numerous prostrate stems; in a dense stand they may become erect.  Prolific seed production, rapid growth following fall rains, and ability to fix nitrogen make it closely resemble a true clover, which it is not (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Burr medic is almost hairless.  The leaflets are wide and rather flat at the top, and sometimes have purple and white flecks on the upper surface or a small purple inverted V mark at the base of the leaf.  The flowers are in groups of two to eight and the wing petals are distinctly longer than the keel petals.  Among Western Australian medics, only Calvary medic, an extremely rare species, shares this trait; others have the keel longer, or equal to the wing petals.  The length of the flower stalk is not consistent in this species as it may be longer or shorter than the corresponding leaf stalk.  The fruits are hairless and have two to six anticlockwise coils.  The common name burr medic relates to the pods, which have long, slender spines hooked at the tip which readily adheres to wool.  There are forms with short spines and a variety <I>brevispina</I></B> which is spineless. This variety is rare but found scattered throughout the range of the whole species.  The spineless burrs can be distinguished from spineless barrel medic or disc medic burrs by the radiating veins on the coil surface which are strongly curved, fine and close together, whereas in the latter two species the radiating veins are fewer, almost straight, and rather indistinct (Quinlivan et al.).<P> Cv 'Circle Valley' is similar morphologically to 'Serena.' Stems are ribbed and develop a purple anthocyanin flush where they are exposed to the sun. Leaflets are obovate to wedge shaped 12-23 mm long, 10-15 mm wide and glabrous.  Leaflets have basal purple anthocyanin markings and, during the winter, have further scattered anthocyanin flecking prominent on the leaflet.  Stipules are large, green and glabrous.  Peduncle are normally shorter than adjacent petiole and normally with three yellow flowers, the corolla being approximately twice the length of the calyx.  Mature fruit is cylindrical 7-9 mm in length and coiling anti-clockwise, with 4-5 coils (Mackay and Barnard., 1981).<P> Cv 'Serena' is prostrate or semi-erect, and attains heights up to 20 cm depending on plant density.  Stems exposed to the sun may develop a purple anthocyanin flush.  Stems, petioles and peduncles glabrous or with sparse hairs on peduncle.  Leaflets cuneate or obovate, apex apiculate, margin almost entire or with upper half serrate, upper and lower surfaces glabrous.  Leaves have very rare purple flecks and rare development of a basal purple mark at the junction of the petiole and the lamina. Stipules incised and glabrous on both sides.  Peduncle usually shorter but sometimes longer than the subtending petiole.  Three flowers, 1-2 fruits per peduncle.  Flowers pale yellow, standard about 4 mm long, wings longer than the keel.  Fruit coiling is anti-clockwise: the young fruit is contracted and protrudes sideways from the calyx: young fruits are sparsely hairy, mature fruits glabrous: spineless with 4-4.5 coils forming a small cylinder or truncated cone.  Many (15-20 per cil) radial veins strongly curved, anastomosing into a net and joining a lateral vein which is separated from the wide dorsal suture by a narrow groove (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that bur medic requires about 8 dm (31.50 inches) of rainfall per year but goes on to say that it tolerates annual precipitation of from 3.1-19.1 dm (12.20-75.20 inches). Optimum rainfall is 10-25 inches (Murphy et al., 1976), and it does best where ample moisture is available early in the fall (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  It will produce plants in low- rainfall years if winters temperatures are not too cold (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Bur medic an be used for green forage, rarely as hay, soil renovation, green manure, cover, and erosion prevention (Duke, 1981).  It is not often seeded on range because in most parts of California, where it is adapted, the seed is present and can be encouraged with cultivation, fertilization, and proper grazing. Green plants, dry plants and burs provide good forage (Murphy et al., 1976).  The species is useful in unimproved pastures (Quinlivan et al.). Dense volunteer stands of bur clover can be found in commercial walnut stands despite the lack of conscious encouragement by growers; this suggests that bur clover would be easily managed as a reseeding cover crop for walnut orchards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seed is produced in rounded, coiled burs surrounded by short, hooked spines which cling to animal coats, assisting seed distribution.  However, sheep fleece with burs is discounted in value (Murphy et al., 1976).  There are 3 to 11 seeds per burr, separated by partitions.  The seeds are 2 to 4 mm long and oval, rather than kidney-shaped as in barrel medic (Quinlivan et al.). Mackay and Barnard (1981) state that more cvv 'Circle Valley' and 'Serena' normally have 5 seeds per bur.  A high percentage of the seed is hard, ensuring stand regeneration in the face of variable weather conditions (Murphy et al., 1976). According to Murphy et al.  (1976), there are 145,000 seeds/lb., whereas Mackay and Barnard (1981) estimate 280,000 seeds per kg.(about 127,000 per lb.) for both cvv 'Circle Valley' and 'Serena.' 'Circle Valley' seeds are oval to kidney shaped and glossy yellow; those of 'Serena' are yellow brown (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Commercial supplies of seed are sometimes limited (Murphy et al., 1976). Most stands of bur clover are volunteer; limited supplies of seed are available (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>In California, flowering occurs from March through June (Munz, 1973).  Duke (1981) listed flowering as occurring during summer and fall, but in California, this would presumably occur only if the crop is sown in the spring in some coastal areas (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Bur clover shows early and continued (indeterminate) flowering coupled with continued vegetative growth (Bugg, pers. comm.).  In San Diego County, cv 'Circle Valley' flowers in 96 days (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).  Flowering is 4-5 weeks after 'Cyprus' barrel according to Murphy et al.  (1976) and some 3 or 4 weeks later according to Mackay and Barnard (1981).  The latter two workers report that testing over 3 years and at 6 sites in Western Australia has given a mean period to flowering of 140 days from a mid-April germination, 122 days from a mid-May germination, and 112 days from mid-June.  Cv 'Circle Valley' flowers prolifically and over a relatively long period (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Serena' requires 62 days to flower according to Weitkamp and Graves (1988), 65 according to Miller et al.  (1989), and 70 based on the account of Mackay and Barnard (1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Bur medic tolerates soil pH of from 5.3-8.2, with a mean of 30 cases of 6.8; it is deemed tolerant of alkali and high pH (Duke, 1981).  Murphy et al. (1976) stated that bur medic tolerates soil pH of from 4.7-8.  Bur medic is said to be well adapted to all orchard and vineyard soils that are neutral to slightly alkaline (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  It is less tolerant of acid soil than is subclover (Murphy et al., 1976).  <I>Medicago murex</I></B>, <I>M. polymorpha</I></B>, and <I>M.  soleirolii</I></B> are particularly good at nodulating on acid soils when acid-tolerant rhizobia are used (<I>Rhizobia meliloti</I></B> strain WSM419).  <I>M.  tornata</I></B>, <I>M. truncatula</I></B>, and <I>M. littoralis</I></B> did not perform so well (Howieson and Ewing, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Bur medic can cause bloat, which seldom occurs with rose clover or subclovers (Murphy et al., 1976).  The coumesterol level of 'Serena' is satisfactory, being intermediate between 'Harbinger' and 'Cyprus' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  Bur medic causes burr infestation to wool (Quinlivan et al.), for which fleece is discounted in value.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Alfalfa weevil damage on bur clover can be so widespread that plants are almost completely skeletonized (Murphy et al.  1976). Cvv 'Circle Valley' and 'Serena' both show fair tolerance to Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> In an unreplicated observation in southern Georgia, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) (tarnished plant bug) attained extremely-high densities on <I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> ssp <I>subspina</I></B> cv 'Circle Valley', placing it well above the 95% confidence interval for densities observed on 11 varieties of subterranean clover (Bugg et al., 1990).<P> In southern Oregonian pear orchards, certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems.  Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, bur clover appeared particularly prone to outbreaks of the mite.  Use of herbicides led to increased movement by mites into trees (Flexner et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This species has variously been termed bur clover (Finch and Sharp.  1983), bur-clover (McKee, 1949), burr medic (Mackay and Barnard, 1981; Quinlivan et al.), California burclover (Duke, 1981), and toothed burclover (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Bur medic is a winter annual herb that produces hard seed which will not germinate for 2-3 years.  In dry years, 1-2 irrigations may be required to ensure establishment prior to fall rains (Duke, 1981).  This early-maturing, reseeding annual legume germinates in the winter but puts on most of its growth during the spring (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  'Circle Valley' shows unusually vigorous early winter growth (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Bur medic is a reliable reseeder, and volunteers into many orchards (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Dense volunteer stands of bur clover can be found in commercial walnut stands despite the lack of conscious encouragement by growers.  This suggests that bur clover would be easily managed as a reseeding cover crop for walnut orchards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Finch and Sharp (1983) said that bur medic is about 6 to 10 inches tall, but cv 'Circle Valley' can reach 40 cm (15.75 inches) in dense stands (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  In Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991. 'Circle Valley' attained a height of 34.93+/-5.43 cm (13.75 +/- 2.14 inches, Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Seed maturity is in mid April-May according to (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Cv 'Serena' shows especially early maturity (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Bur medic is best adapted where mowing heights of 3 to 5 inches restricts growth of other plants that would crowd it out (Finch and Shar, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Bur medic is said to be tolerant of weeds (Duke, 1981). Mowing heights of 3 to 5 inches favor bur clover by restricting growth of other potentially-competing plants (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> During May in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, for plots seeded in October to cv 'Circle Valley' weed dry above-ground biomass was 0.896+/-0.609 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which was 18.2% of the value obtained in control plots.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  Vegetational cover by bur medic in early May was 73.00+/-18.70 % (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Broadcasting followed by light harrowing is a good seeding method; seed should only be covered lightly (Duke, 1981); a firm seedbed was recommended by Duke (1981) and by Finch and Sharp (1983).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Rhizobial inoculant type is "Medicago Spec.  1" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981).<P> Inoculation of bur clover seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD increased the number of lateral roots and root hairs. Similar symptoms can be caused by application of indole acetic acid to growth media.  High concentrations of the bacterium reduced root elongation, but the reduction was lessened by addition of rhizobia (Yahalom et al., 1991).<P> Inoculation of bur clover and berseem clover seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD accelerated the development of nodules.  There was also an increase in root surface area and nutrient uptake (Yahalom et al., 1989).<P> <I>Medicago murex</I></B>, <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B>, and <I>M. soleirolii</I></B> are particularly good at nodulating on acid soils when acid-tolerant rhizobia are used (<I>Rhizobia meliloti</I></B> strain WSM419).  <I>M.  tornata</I></B>, <I>M. truncatula</I></B>, and <I>M. littoralis</I></B> did not perform so well (Howieson and Ewing, 1989).<P> On neutral and alkaline soils, competition by burclover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Burclover is very sensitive to 2,4-D herbicide and can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Bur clover is compatible in mixes with rose clover and subterranean clovers (Bugg, pers. comm.).  On neutral and alkaline soils, competition by bur clover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Bur clover is very sensitive to 2,4-D herbicide and can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>'Circle Valley': In an unreplicated trial in southern Georgia, bur medic cv 'Circle Valley' yielded approximately 140 kg/ha of nitrogen in above-ground portions (Bugg, pers. comm.). Bur medic has a mean protein content of 19% by weight (Duke, 1981) and 6.25% of the protein is presumably N.  Using these values and Duke's (1981) biomass figures, one can project N yields of 61.75 to 92.63 kg N/ha.  Biomass data of Bugg et al. (unpublished data) from Mendocino County translate to 102.92 kg/ha from.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>This species is more sensitive to 2,4-D than are members of the genus <I>Trifolium</I></B> (Duke, 1981).  On neutral and alkaline soils, competition by burclover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Burclover can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a of 2,4-D (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Bur medic seedlings are said to show much more rapid taproot growth than do those of subterranean clovers, and hence bur medic is better adapted to discontinuous rains that characterize much of California.  Early fall rains followed by drought will tend to favor bur medic over subterranean clovers (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P> Medic inoculation of bur medic seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD increased the number of lateral roots and root hairs.  Similar symptoms can be caused by application of indole acetic acid to growth media.  High concentrations of the bacterium reduced root elongation, but the reduction was lessened by addition of rhizobia (Yahalom et al., 1991).<P> Medic inoculation of bur medic and berseem clover seedlings with the bacterium <I>Azospirillum brasilense</I></B> Strain CD accelerated the development of nodules.  There was also an increase in root surface area and nutrient uptake (Yahalom et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Superphosphate is often needed, as are potassium and even nitrogen on poor soils; it grows well in alkali soil containing 12.5 MT/ha carbonate of soda in the top 75 cm of soil (Duke, 1981). Based on pot experiments and literature review, burr medic and barrel medic are not as efficient at absorbing P as is subterranean clover.  Yellow serradella is more efficient at absorbing P from soil than either subterranean clover or burr medic (Paynter, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>In Hopland, Mendocino County, California, dry above-ground biomass during May for October-seeded cv 'Circle Valley' was 8.352+/-1.836 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  (Bugg et al., unpublished data), whereas cover crop + weeds totalled 9.248+/-1.403 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Duke (1981) reported hay yields of bur medic of 5-7.5 Mg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>In dry areas, seedlings may require 1-2 irrigations before winter rains commence (Duke, 1981).  Root growth of bur medic seedlings is faster than that of seedlings of subterranean clovers, facilitating establishment with more erratic rainfall (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>The following account is from Duke (1981).  Bur medic is assigned to the Eurosiberian and Hindustani Centers of Diversity, and is native in southern Europe north to Britain, east to Russian and Crimea, eastward to Punjab, Kumaon, North Bengal, and Madras, western and Central Asia, China, Japan, North Africa, south to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, and Tanzania.  It is also cultivated in Argentina, Australia, and the Pacific Coast of the U.S.A.  It occurs at elevations up to 1,500 m in the Himalayas and to 1,900 m in Tanzania.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that bur medic is tolerant of shade.  Bugg (pers. comm.) noted that it is a common volunteer in the understories of Californian walnut orchards, which are heavily shaded from April through November.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Bur medic does not tolerate high soil salinity (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seed should be covered lightly with soil, which could be obtained by broadcasting seed and harrowing lightly (Duke, 1981). 1/2-inch seeding depth suffices (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the following retail prices for 1993: cv 'Serena' $1.60/lb, 'Circle Valley' $2.00/lb, and 'Santiago' $1.93/lb<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Seed of bur medic retains viability for several years if left in the bur, but deteriorates more rapidly if hulled.  Under the latter scenario, germination nevertheless remains high for 3 years or more (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>A firm seedbed is important; in dry parts of California, 1-2 irrigations may be needed before winter rains commence (Duke, 1981).  Low seeding rates may suffice, because self-reseeding in subsequent years fills in the stand (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Bur medic can be incorporated with disk, rototiller, or power spader (Bugg, pers. comm.).  When bur medic is relay intercropped with corn or cotton (inter-row spacing 1.3-1.4 m), remnant strips of the legume can provide sufficient seed to reseed the entire area (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Seed may be harvested by sweeping by hand with stiff brooms (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Normal tillage and mowing equipment are appropriate (Bugg, pers. comm.), however, pure stands of burclover may lie close to the ground and be difficult to mow (Duke, 1981); therefore, if grown for hay, it is often sown in mixture with oats or wheat, at 12.5 bu/ha of bur medic to 5 bu/ha of oat or 4.5 bu/ha of wheat (Duke, 1981).  Seed may be harvested by sweeping by hand with stiff brooms (Duke, 1981).<P>

<DD>Bur medic in solid stands has caused bloat in cattle numerous times.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Bur medic does well on many soil types, including poorly-drained adobe soils; it tolerates soil pH of from 5.3-8.2, with a mean of 30 cases of 6.8; it is deemed tolerant of heavy soil, alkali, and high pH (Duke, 1981).  Bur medic is said to be well adapted to all orchard and vineyard soils that are neutral to slightly alkaline (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  On poor, mildly-acid soils, bur medic grows better than black medic (McLeod, 1982), but it is less tolerant of acid soil than is subclover (Murphy et al., 1976). Madson (1951) recommended loam soils, whereas Murphy et al.  (1976) suggested heavy soils. Finch and Sharp (1983) said that bur medic is best adapted to soils with good moisture holding capacity.<P> Cv 'Circle Valley' has regenerated strongly at Speddingup, Australia, in a transitional soil zone between the inland alkaline malle soils and the acid scrub-plain soils nearer the coast.  At the same site various cultivars and varieties of barrel and disc medic failed to establish and persist effectively.  Subterranean clover also has proved only partially satisfactory on these extensive soil types (in Australia) which consist of a slightly acid grey-brown surface sand or loamy sand becoming increasingly loamy at depth. They tend towards a neutral reaction at 5-20 cm and normally have a domed clay profile at 30-60 cm (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>

<DD>Sting nematode was scarce following cover cropping with hairy indigo, and yields of succeeding crops of snap beans or cabbage were little reduced (Rhoades, 1983).<P> Rotation with the leguminous forage crop hairy indigo (<I>Indigofera hirsuta</I></B>) was not as effective as treatment with aldicarb (Temik) in improving peanut yields, but rotation did lead to a 15% yield improvement over continuous peanuts.  Juvenile <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B> were significantly reduced in peanuts that followed hairy indigo; further reduction was caused through application of aldicarb (Rodriguez-Kabana, 1988).<P> In a greenhouse pot survey of various warm-season legumes, hairy indigo was particularly effective in reducing rootknot nematodes (<I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B> and <I>M.  incognita</I></B>) and soybean cyst nematode (<I>Heterodera glycines</I></B> race 4).  Field studies also indicated effectiveness in reducing densities of rootknot and cyst nematodes (Rodriguez-Kabana, 1988).<P>

<DD>In a two-year, replicated study, Sengonca and Frings (1988) grew tansy phacelia  (<I>Phacelia tanacetifolia</I></B>, Hydrophyllaceae) on the corners, in interior strips, and in "islands", in conjunction with 200-m2 plots of sugarbeet. Control plots featured monocultures of sugarbeet.  Densities of bean aphid (<I>Aphis fabae</I></B>) and eggs and larvae of aphidophagous hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) were highest in control plots.  On the other hand, sugarbeet yields were significantly higher, and adult syrphids (which feed on floral nectar and pollen of phacelia) were significantly more abundant in the plots with phacelia.  Syrphids were credited with reducing the aphids in plots with phacelia.  Aphidophagous syrphids observed included <I>Episyrphus balteatus, Metasyrphus corollae, Sphaerophoria scripta, Scaeva selenitica,</I></B> and <I>Melanostoma scalare.</I></B>.<P> Tansy phacelia is an annual plant native to California and introduced as a bee plant to Europe during the early 1900's.  It is used as a cover crop in Europe, but (at least in California) harbors high densities of <I>Lygus</I></B> spp.  and should be used with care (Bugg, pers. comm.).  When tansy phacelia was grown in a commercial flower garden in Capitola, Santa Cruz Co., during 1980, the plant harbored high densities of <I>Lygus</I></B> spp.  When the plant died during spring, the <I>Lygus</I></B> dispersed and caused damage to other flowers in the garden (Richard Reed, pers. comm.).<P> Flowers of tansy phacelia are attractive to bees (Pears et al., 1989).<P>

<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Erosion of soil, runoff water volume, and runoff content of nitrate, ammonia, and phosphorus were measured under four cover-cropping regimes preceding no-till soybean (<I>Glycine max</I></B> [L.] Merr.): (1) common chickweed (<I>Stellaria media</I></B> L., Caryophyllaceae); (2) Canada bluegrass (<I>Poa compressa</I></B> L., Poaceae); (3) downy brome (<I>Bromus tectorum</I></B> L., Poaceae); and (4) no cover crop (check).  The three regimes involving cover crops gave 31-40% greater vegetational cover (by cover crop + soybean) than did the check, and significantly reduced runoff and soil erosion.  There were no significant effects of cover regime on loss of dissolved nitrate, ammonia, or phosphate (Zhu et al., 1989).<P> Organic matter addition by green manuring does not directly affect all physical parameters.  Most likely to be increased are aggregate stability and bulk density, which may in turn improve water movement or retention.  These improvements do not necessarily occur.  It is rare that green manuring will increase soil organic matter; maintenance of organic matter will be attained in particular but ill-defined circumstances.  Even if soil physical condition is improved, increased crop yields may not occur.  Yield improvements resulting from improved soil structure are most likely when abnormal weather conditions prevail (MacRae and Mehuys, 1985).<P> Lloyd N.  Mielke (USDA-ARS, Soil and Water Conservation Research, East Campus, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583, phone: 402-472-1516) has developed (in collaboration with Alice Jones [soil scientist] and Leonard Bashford [agricultural engineer] of the University of Nebraska) a modified sweep plough that loosens soil and increases water holding capacity while leaving cover-crop residues on the surface.  Earlier versions of the sweep plough caused sheer planes, which reduce infiltration of water and may interfere with root penetration.  A key feature of the current version is the presence of 6-inch-long steel shanks that break up soil in the sheer zone, and keep soil porous (Kaniuka, 1988).<P> Laboratory studies using double-tube apparatus showed that deep-rooted alfalfa can supply water to associated shallow-rooted maize during periods when water is in short supply in the shallow portions of the soil profile. This suggests that living mulches might do the same thing for associated economic crops (Corak et al., 1987).<P> Ten years of research has shown that vetch and rye mulch averaged 3.11 inches less water runoff per year than plowed unmulched corn (Hargrove, 1982).<P>

There were no significant effects of cover regime on loss of dissolved nitrate, ammonia, or phosphate (Zhu et al., 1989).<P> Organic matter addition by green manuring does not directly affect all physical parameters.  Most likely to be increased are aggregate stability and bulk density, which may in turn improve water movement or retention.  These improvements do not necessarily occur.  It is rare that green manuring will increase soil organic matter; maintenance of organic matter will be attained in specific but ill-defined circumstances.  Even if soil physical condition is improved, increased crop yields may not occur.  Yield improvements resulting from improved soil structure are most likely when abnormal weather conditions prevail (MacRae and Mehuys, 1985).<P> Lloyd N.  Mielke (USDA-ARS, Soil and Water Conservation Research, East Campus, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583, phone: 402-472-1516) has developed (in collaboration with Alice Jones [soil scientist] and Leonard Bashford [agricultural engineer] of the University of Nebraska) a modified sweep plough that loosens soil and increases water holding capacity while leaving cover-crop residues on the surface.  Earlier versions of the sweep plough caused sheer planes, which reduce infiltration of water and may interfere with root penetration.  A key feature of the current version is the presence of 6-inch-long steel shanks that break up soil in the sheer zone, and keep soil porous (Kaniuka, 1988).<P> In a review article, Hogue and Neilsen (1987) compared various effects of permanent vegetation (="grassed"), organic mulches, herbicides, and cultivation as approaches to managing orchard understories, effects on tree growth, yield, and soil were considered.  Overall considerations suggest that organic mulching in tree rows and grassed alleys may be the ideal approach, but that economics may dictate use of inorganic mulches or herbicides to suppress weeds in the tree row.  There is no consideration of the role of legumes in an orchard system, nor of the variability of different plant materials.<P> In a four-year field study in Nebraska, hairy vetch tilled under supplied N equivalent to or greater than 55 lb of fertilizer N per acre.  Hairy vetch managed without tillage contributed very little N, even after several years. Much of the N may have been lost by volatilization.  Contrasting results from the southeastern United States suggest that under warmer, more humid conditions, N mineralization from surface residues does provide substantial N to succeeding corn (Power et al., 1991).<P> Ten years of research has shown that vetch and rye mulch averaged 2.38 tons/a less soil erosion per year.  Mulched treatment of vetch and rye increased soil organic matter from 1.5 to 2.6%, and soil N from 0.47 to 0.069% after 10 years of continuous corn, while the plowed check remained at 1.2% organic matter and 0.036% N.

<DD>Lloyd N.  Mielke (USDA-ARS, Soil and Water Conservation Research, East Campus, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583, phone: 402-472-1516) has developed (in collaboration with Alice Jones [soil scientist] and Leonard Bashford [agricultural engineer] of the University of Nebraska) a modified sweep plough that loosens soil and increases water holding capacity while leaving cover-crop residues on the surface.  Earlier versions of the sweep plough caused sheer planes, which reduce infiltration of water and may interfere with root penetration.  A key feature of the current version is the presence of 6-inch-long steel shanks that break up soil in the sheer zone, and keep soil porous (Kaniuka, 1988).<P> Controlled chamber studies showed that surface (no-till) management of leguminous (lentil) residue can lead to 14% loss of N over 14 days (with air flow resulting in 0.5 displacements/minute).  There was a rapid early flush of ammonia volatilization, probably resulting from the decomposition of labile compounds, followed by a period of slower release, presumably resulting from gradual breakdown of more recalcitrant fractions. Incorporation of residue into the soil almost completely eliminated the volatilization (Janzen and McGinn, 1991).<P> A green manure is any crop incorporated before maturity.  These are mainly sources of organic matter and nitrogen.  Green manures are most effective when mixed in the upper few inches of soil. If incorporated too deeply, sufficient air will not be available for decomposition.  Green manures should be mowed and allowed to dry partially before being incorporated, to avoid putrefaction that can occur due to excess moisture.  If cover crops are incorporated while young and succulent, decomposition will be rapid because there is a low carbon:nitrogen ratio.  Therefore, microbes will sequester little of the nitrogen, and it will quickly become available to successive crops.  There will, however, be little accumulation of stable humus.  If incorporated during midseason, green manures will decompose more slowly, so nutrients will only become available later.  However, large amounts of organic matter are available, and soil structure will benefit more than if the green manure were young and succulent. Allowing cover crops to flower and mature partially prior to incorporation will lead to improved soil aeration. Carbon:nitrogen ratios will be high, leading to slow decomposition and protection of nutrients from leaching. Perennial sod crops become green manures when plowed under in advance of other crops (Gershuny and Smillie, 1986).<P> Cereal rye is difficult to incorporate (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>Vegetative bud development in the spring and fruit maturity were usually delayed on blueberry plants grown between sodded alleys (sown with <I>Festuca arundinacea</I></B> Schreb cv TK 31U) or with pine sawdust mulch.  Blueberry plants without sod or mulch had 88% and 79% of the fruit in the first harvest in 1985 and 1986, respectively, compared to 81% and 73% for plants with sod but no mulch (P=0.05) (Patten et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Low-growing perennial clovers may be used as living mulches between rows of economic crops (Gershuny and Smillie, 1986).<P> In a survey of 55 growers using cover crops in the northeastern United States:<P> 37 growers used cover crops to build soil fertility,<P> 15 used cover crops to improve soil structure and tilth,<P> 24 used cover crops to protect soil and prevent erosion,<P> 14 used cover crops to reduce the need for off-farm soil amendments,<P> 25 used leguminous cover crops as green manures to add soil nitrogen,<P> 5 used cover crops to make P and other nutrients more available,<P> 26 used cover crops for weed control,<P> 10 used cover crops to prepare new land for vegetable production,<P> 5 used cover crops for grain production,<P> 9 used cover crops for livestock feed,<P> 6 used cover crops for control of insect pests and diseases,<P> 3 used cover crops to reduce labor costs for tilling and weeding,<P> 8 used cover crops to prevent N leaching (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> The most common legume used in the Northeast is red clover. Smaller numbers of growers use alfalfa or sweetclovers (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Perennial cover crops are to be preferred over annual because large numbers of nematodes migrate from roots into soils after annuals mature (Marks and Townshend, 1973).<P> Many legumes are hosts to <I>Meloidogyne spp</I></B> (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Rooting depths in growth pouches (12 legumes evaluated) or in slant tubes (19 legumes evaluated) were positively correlated with performance in the field (up to at least 32 days after planting) (Brar et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Surface sowing of inoculated arrowleaf clover seed resulted in rapid decline in the densities of viable rhizobia, compared to seed planted at depths of 10 and 25 mm. Gum arabic was much better at promoting longevity of rhizobia than was water used as a sticker for the peat-based inoculum.  A streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobia was used in this test, and water rinsate of the seed was plated out on a restrictive culture medium following serial dilution.  Colonies of rhizobia were evaluated two days later (Weaver and Holt, 1990).<P> Experimental  evidence  using  sterilized  and subsequently-reinoculated soil suggests that rhizobia are somewhat protected from predatory protozoans when secreted within soil aggregates of a diameter greater than 50 microns. However, in relatively wet soils, it may be less likely for them to find such microniches.  Also, other bacteria may compete for these microniches (Postma et al., 1989).<P> Based on tests of seed from collected from retail outlets throughout Kentucky, coating with CaCO3 of preinoculated seed leads to better performance of rhizobia for alfalfa, but not for red clover seed.  Performance was based on nodulation frequency and nitrogen content of plants grown in plastic growth pouches (3 seeds per pouch) with unsterilized soil (Vincent and Smith, 1982).<P> In this comparison of commercially- vs.  laboratory-produced inoculated, pelleted seed (coated with CaCO3) for effectiveness of nodulation and densities of rhizobia.  In general, commercially-inoculated seed had less than one hundredth as high a density of rhizobia as did the seed inoculated in the laboratory (Brockwell et al., 1975).  Inoculated, pelleted legume seed should always be sown as soon as possible after treatment and in any event before 4 weeks have elapsed.  Methyl cellulose can be substituted for gum arabic as an adhesive for inoculant (Anonymous, 1976).<P> Guidlines for inoculation, as presented by Anonymous (1976):<P> (1) Use a good commercial inoculant with the specific rhizobial type for the legume to be sown.  (2) Check expiration date, and do not use inoculant if the date has elapsed.  Ascertain that the inoculant has been stored in refrigeration.  (3) Use inoculant at the rate recommended by the manufacturer or at a higher rate (up to 4 X recommended rate).  (4) Mix inoculant and seed thoroughly, but without excess water.  (5) Hold inoculated seed in a cool, shady area.  Plant into a moist seedbed.  (6) Avoid drying seed: this will kill the rhizobia.  (7) Sow seed as soon as possible. Pellet seed if planting must be delayed, or if seeding is to be done into a dry seedbed, broadcast without being incorporated, or aerially seeded.  (8) Always pellet seed if the area to be seeded has abundant native legumes.  Use high rates of inoculum. Otherwise, the seeded legumes may be parasitized by incumbent rhizobia that are ineffective nodulators.  (9) Do not mix acid, or trace-nutrient-containing fertilizers or pesticides with inoculated legume seed.  Do not treat inoculated seed with herbicides, fungicides, or insecticides.  Most of these are highly toxic to rhizobia.  (10) Phosphorus and sulfur are the elements most commonly deficient in Californian rangeland soils. Be sure that these are adequately available.  (11) Avoid the use of nitrogen fertilizers.  (12) A good legume stand should have at least 20 plants per square foot.  (13) After legumes have produced three or four leaves, excavate a few plants and check for nodulation.  Lack of nodules usually indicates faulty technique.  A few large nodules that are pink inside and located on the crown or in the upper roots indicate early, effective nodulation.  Many small, white nodules over the entire root system indicate ineffective nodulation by resident rhizobia. To pellet seed:<P> (1) Use fresh inoculant, and use 4 X the amount recommended. Use gum arabic (without preservatives) at least fine enough to pass through 8-mesh screen; dissolve 4 lb of gum arabic per gallon of water.  Use finely-ground calcium carbonate (CaCO3) (80% should pass through a 200-mesh screen).  (2) For vetch, 100 lb of seed requires 21/2 quarts of the gum arabic solution and 30 lb of calcium carbonate.  For 100 lb of seed of subterranean, rose, or crimson clovers, 5 quarts of solution and 50 lb of calcium carbonate are required. For 100 lb of alfalfa or bur clover seed, 5 quarts of gum arabic solution and 40 lb of calcium carbonate are needed.  (3) Dissolve gum arabic in hot water: do not boil.  It will dissolve in about 30 minutes in hot water or overnight in cold water.  Cool the solution.  Add the correct amount of inoculant and stir into a smooth slurry.  Immediately pour the seed into a cement mixer, add the gum-inoculant mixture, and rotate at high speed until all seeds are coated.  While the mixer is running, add all the calcium carbonate at once. After all lots have been run, clean the mixer by running a load of water and gravel through it. Pellets allowed to sit for 24 hours are firmer, and will perform better in a seed drill.  Screen or winnow the seed to remove excess calcium carbonate.  Do not use vigorous agitators in the seeding equipment, because these may damage the pellet coatings.<P> Note from R.L.  Bugg: An easier alternative to all these things is to use the PelGel/Pelinoc system from Nitragin, per the printed instructions (Holland et al., 1969).<P> Guidelines for inoculating legumes were provided by Anonymous (no year given):<P> (1) Use specific inoculant type for the crop to be seeded.  (2) Check expiration date on inoculant.  When using pre-inoculated (e.g., pelleted) seed, check expiration date and seed as soon as possible.  If in doubt, to ensure viability of rhizobia, reinoculate.  (3) Store inoculant in cool location and do not expose to sunlight.  (4) Use a ratio of 1:10 sticker to water. Corn syrup, sugar, powdered milk, or commercial stickers can be used. (5) For adverse or dryland situations, apply inoculant at twice the recommended rate.  (6) If legume plants are stunted or yellowish, this may indicate a nitrogen deficiency and probably failure of inoculation.  Pink to red nodules indicate nitrogen fixation. Green nodules are not active, and white nodules are ineffective .<P> Anonymous (no year given) continued that nitrogen fixation is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) to ammonia nitrogen (NH3). During the establishment of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, rhizobia multiply in the root zone, invade root hairs, follow an infection thread into the root proper, and then multiply along with root cells to form a nodule.  Thereafter, fixation of nitrogen begins. If inoculant is applied to the legume seed prior to sowing, this is termed the seed applied method.  If inoculant is metered into the furrow during seeding, this is termed the direct soil method.<P> Anonymous (no year given) wrote that ineffective or inefficient resident rhizobia may colonize legumes that are seeded without having been properly inoculated.  To check for effective nodulation, wait about 50 days after germination and excavate plants carefully, to avoid damaging nodules.  Nodules should be abundant around the taproot and have a pink to beefsteak-red color inside.  Molybdenum can be a limiting element in nitrogen fixation, particularly if it is unavailable due to low soil pH. The advantages of inoculating legumes are most clear the first year that legume is seeded in a particular field.  Sometimes the advantages are not visible in the field but only become apparent after harvest and weighing.  Peat-based legume inoculants show better survival of rhizobia than do agar, broth, or freeze-dried cultures.  Direct soil inoculation systems can employ either granular or liquid rhizobial formulations.  The former is easier to use and can avoid the contact of rhizobia with fungicide-treated seed.  It is also important to growers using air or plateless planters.  Seed applied delivery or inoculation systems include planter box, preinoculated seed, and custom inoculation. Planter box inoculation involves mixing the inoculant and seed in the hopper and can involve dry (dry method) or moistened (sprinkle method) peat-based inoculant or the use of a slurry (slurry method) including the inoculant, water, and perhaps stickers such as NitraCoat or NutriGum (both produced by Nitragin) to improve adherence and survival of rhizobia. Pre-inoculation of legume seed is done prior to sale to the grower.  This approach is fraught with uncertainty as to the viability of the rhizobia because the grower usually cannot be sure of the time elapsed since incoculation nor of the conditions under which the inoculated seed was subsequently stored.  Custom inoculation can have the same disadvantages but usually is under closer control by the grower.  The Pelinoc System (Nitragin) appears particularly effective and involves the use of a fine-mesh peat-based inoculant and a nutrient-rich sticker called PelGel.  This approach supplies high densities of rhizobia and extends the viability of rhizobia even in hot, dry soils.  This method is compatible with cyclone or aerial seeding.<P> Nitragin Company, Inc.  (no date) advised that growers should keep the following guidelines in mind: (1) Rhizobia are perishable; growers should carefully consider expiration dates on packages of rhizobial inoculant.  (2) Peat is the best carrier for maintaining rhizobial viability.  (3) Make sure that there is sufficient inoculant for the amount of seed that must be sown. (4) Avoid mixing fungicides and other chemicals with inoculants, and avoid pre-mixed products.  (5) Store inoculant in cool areas and out of sunlight. Do not leave inoculants ovenight in planting equipment. (6) Make sure that the correct inoculant type is used for the legume to be planted.  (7) Get recommmendations from Cooperative Extension specialists or county agents, preferably based on findings from local or regional tests.<P> Jones et al.  (1978) wrote that the "PELGEL-PELINOC" system is a proprietary system (Nitragin Co.) of inoculation seed using a sticker with a gum-arabic base and peat moss inoculum (50g/kg seed) for coating and drying instead of limestone.  The sticker is called "PELGEL" and the inoculum "PELINOC".<P> Graves (1986) related that the PELINOC-PELGEL inoculation system was developed by Dr.  Joseph Burton of The Nitragin Company.  It is a "do-it- yourself" system designed to be used on farm, and is easier, costs less, and makes a more durable product than the pellet-inoculation system described in AXT-280 that Cooperative Extension agents have been recommending. A total of about 6 lbs of dry weight PELINOC-PELGEL materials are added per 100 lbs of seed. Data from Mendocino and Butte Counties showed PELINOC-PELGEL be consistently superior to the method described in AXT-280.<P> According to the account by the Nitragin Co.  (1975), the Australians were pioneers in establishing legumes on rough, infertile, acid soils where they had to grow clover to feed livestock.  Large peat base inocula were required and a concentrated gum solution was needed to stick the inoculum to the seed. Five quarts of the inoculant-gum slurry was mixed with 100 lbs of seed.  The wetted seeds were then dried by mixing quickly with 60 lbs of very finely pulverized limestone in a small concrete mixer.  The limestone coated the seed.  This method of inoculation is called "lime-pelleting". "Lime-pelleting" is a good method of inoculating seed, but it has several disadvantages: (1) it requires machinery; (2) it almost doubles the weight of the seed; (3) the coated seeds are very abrasive and cause excessive wear on drilling equipment; (4) the heavy coating of limestone actually gives little protection to the nodule bacteria and is so slowly soluble that it has little effect on soil acidity; and (5) it is very expensive. Nonetheless, the results from the "lime-pelleting" inoculation under Australian conditions more than justifies the inconvenience and cost.  The PELINOC system has many advantages over the "lime-pelleting" method: (1) it provides more viable rhizobia on the seed and they survive in greater quantities; (2) it supplies sufficient soluble calcium to neutralize acidity in the microenvironment of the planted seed; (3) it increases weight of the seed by only about 5% and the seeds are easily planted with regular equipment; (4) it is easy to apply and requires no special machinery; and (5) it can be applied by the grower just before planting to assure large numbers of viable rhizobia on the planted seed.  Seed should be inoculated at least one-half hour before planting and may be safely inoculated the day before providing they are stored in a cool place.<P>

<DD>The addition of the equivalent of 31 kg/ha of starter nitrogen did not reduce nitrogen fixation by arrowleaf clover and substantially improved seedling vigor.  Starter nitrogen can actually lead to improved nitrogen fixation by legumes (Schomberg and Weaver, 1990).<P> Controlled chamber studies showed that surface (no-till) management of leguminous (lentil) residue can lead to 14% loss of N over 14 days (with air flow resulting in 0.5 displacements/minute).  There was a rapid early flush of ammonia volatilization, probably resulting from the decomposition of labile compounds, followed by a period of slower release, presumably resulting from gradual breakdown of more recalcitrant fractions. Incorporation of residue into the soil almost completely eliminated the volatilization (Janzen and McGinn, 1991).<P> In a survey of 55 growers in the northeastern United States, 25 used leguminous cover crops as green manures to add soil nitrogen (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> In a survey of 55 growers in the northeastern United States, 8 used cover crops to prevent N leaching (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> In a four-year field study in Nebraska, hairy vetch tilled under supplied N equivalent to or greater than 55 lb of fertilizer N per acre.  Hairy vetch managed without tillage contributed very little N, even after several years. Much of the N may have been lost by volatilization.  Contrasting results from the southeastern United States suggest that under warmer, more humid conditions, N mineralization from surface residues does provide substantial N to succeeding corn (Power et al., 1991).<P> It appears that nitrogen applied to corn can be reduced by 50 to 80 lbs/acre when a legume cover crop is used (Hargrove, 1982).<P> In order for N mineralization to occur, N concentration of incorporated residue must exceed 15-25 g/kg.  However, little mineralization will occur if there are high concentrations of lignin or polyphenols.  In a study involving the decomposition of and N mineralization from residues of 6 kinds of legumes (alfalfa, round leaf cassia, leucaena, Fitzroy stylo, snail medic, and <I>Vigna trilobata</I></B>, the ratio of (lignin+polyphenols):N was a good predictor of N mineralization rate, whereas initial N concentration of residues was not.  After 12 weeks, net N mineralized ranged from 11% from round leaf cassia to 47% for alfalfa (Fox et al., 1990).<P>

Shorey saw similar patterns whether understories have sown cover crops mixtures or resident vegetation (weeds), but he would not use just one cover crop (e.g., buckwheat) (Renn, 1991).<P> Convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville) and <I>Olla abdominalis</I></B> (Say) (now termed <I>O.  v-nigrum</I></B> [Mulsant]) were the two most abundant Coccinellidae attacking walnut aphid (<I>Chromaphis juglandicola</I></B> [Kaltenbach]) in northern Californian groves of Persian walnut. Gound cover (unspecified composition) can assist biological control by convergent lady beetle because it harbors aphids (which serve as alternate prey) from late February through April or May.  If ground cover is disked or chopped too early, beetles will emigrate before walnut aphid is available. Such disengagement of the predators can lead to eruptions of the aphid. Chopping of understory cover killed many lady beetles, but some, including pupae, survived.  The retention of lady beetles in close proximity to walnut trees is probably more important than production of large numbers of beetles (Sluss, 1967).<P> In a survey of 55 growers in the northeastern United States, 6 used cover crops for control of insect pests and diseases (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Tarnished plant bug, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) and stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) cause catfacing damage to peaches and are abundant on flowering winter-annual weeds in the orchard understories.  The present unreplicated study indicated greater damage in an orchard with a weedy understory than in weed-free (herbicided with Simazine) orchard (Johnson, 1989).<P> Wireworms were encountered in a significantly higher proportion of cornfields with a prior cropping history of sod.  No data on damage or economics were presented (Belcher, 1989).<P> In North Carolinian peach orchards, weedy plots dominated by chickweed and Carolina geranium showed higher percentages of catfacing damage to fruits, caused by hemipteran insects (<I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> and several types of stink bug).  In 1986, catfacing damage was 8.9% in weedy plots vs.  2.6% and 2.2% in plots with no winter annuals and bare ground.  The corresponding values for 1987 were 28.2%, 14.4%, and 10.2% (Meagher and Meyer, 1990).<P> Tarnished plant bug, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois); stink bugs (dusky stink bug, <I>Euschistus tristigmus</I></B> [Say]; brown stink bug, <I>E. servus</I></B> [Say]; green stink bug, <I>Acrosternum hilare</I></B> [Say]; and <I>Brochymena arborea</I></B> [Hemiptera: Pentatomidae]) cause catfacing damage to peaches and are abundant on flowering winter-annual weeds in the orchard understories.  A previous study by Meyer (1984) (Proceedings of the Southeastern Peach Convention) indicated that suppression of understory winter annuals reduced incidence of catfacing.  The present study, though unreplicated, confirmed this finding (Johnson, 1988).<P>

<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Cover crops require water, but also may condition soil to improved water infiltration; used as mulches, cover crop residues can reduce evapotranspiration rates (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Leguminous cover crops through their nitrogen fixation, produce hydronium ions and thereby lower soil pH.  However, the addition of soil organic matter buffers this to some extent (Bugg, pers.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Cover crops are available for most soil types.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Cover crops vary greatly in their shade tolerance.  Especially intolerant are buckwheat and sesbania.  Especially tolerant are cowpea, hyacinth bean, and bur medic (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Cover crops vary greatly in their salinity tolerance. Especially tolerant are barley, 'Salina' strawberry clover, white and yellow sweetclovers, and sourclover.  Especially intolerant are bur medic and field pea (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Cover crops vary greatly in their sensitivities to herbicides. Subterranean clovers are relatively tolerant of glyphosate; many legumes, once established, are tolerant of 2,4-DB.  Various herbicides are categorized based on their suitability for controlling grasses or broadleaf weeds.  Thus, some selectivity is possible (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Cover crops vary in their life cycles.  Cool-season annual plants are typically sown in the autumn, and flower and senesce in the spring and early summer.  Warm-season annuals are sown after the threat of frost is past, flower during the summer, and senesce or are frost-killed in the fall or winter.  Biennial species include certain Brassicaceae and Fabaceae that grow vegetatively the first year and flower and senenesce the second year. Perennial species may show either cool- or warm-season growth, or both.  In some cases, seasonal dormancy may be induced by lack of water, cold, heat, or photoperiod.  Some plants may behave as annuals or perennials in different parts of their geographic ranges, or under different management regimes.  Some cover crops are self-regenerating; others require reseeding by the farmer.  Again, management regime may determine which is the case (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>

<H1>Cover Crops: The Sequel<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's note:</B> <I>This article is a continued summary of
the July 1989 cover crops meeting at UC Davis, sponsored by UC
SAREP with funding from the USDA's Alternative Agricultural Opportunities
program. The purpose of the meeting of 50 researchers, educators
and growers was to stimulate interaction among people with both
research and practical experience.  Information presented at the
meeting is being compiled by SAREP for publication. Similar meetings
in other states within the western US are planned as part of a
two-year grant from the USDA's Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture
Program (LISA).<BR>
</I>
<H3>Organic Field Crops</H3>
<P>
<B>Dan Cohen</B>, director of the California Organic Field Crops
Association, stressed the importance of fieldscale trials to demonstrate
soil-improving properties of cover crops. Farmers are seldom persuaded
by trials that rely on small experimental plots, he said. Nitrogen
cost is a significant concern to his growers, who farm a total
of 500,000 acres. They are also interested in the development
of rotational schemes that take into account nematodes and other
pests, Cohen said.<BR>
<H3>High vs. Low-Input Vegetables</H3>
<P>
<B>Laurie Drinkwater</B>, a UC Davis vegetable crops department
researcher, gave a preliminary report on an interdisciplinary
study funded by LISA. Drinkwater, UC Davis Vegetable Crops Assistant
Professor <B>Carol Shennan</B>, UC Davis Plant Pathology Assistant
Professor <B>Ariena van Bruggen</B>, UC Santa Cruz ecologist <B>Deborah
Letourneau</B>,  and  <B>Phil  LeVeen</B>,  an  independent economist,
are assessing soil, water, insect, cost, and yield parameters
for fresh-market tomato production. The study is being conducted
at 14 sites with one tomato variety and horticultural practices
varying from organic to conventional. Three of the farms used
cover crops in the past year.<BR>
<H3>Ecological Roots</H3>
<P>
<B>Rob Klusen</B>, a UC Santa Cruz agroecology graduate student,
discussed the ecology of the root-zone and how it relates to nutrient
cycling. When a root tip penetrates and fractures a soil aggregate
(cluster of soil grains bound by organic matter), organic matter
is exposed, fueling an explosion of soil bacteria, KIusen said.
Amoebae in turn attack the bacteria and release nitrogen compounds
that plants absorb, he said. As roots continue to grow, reaggregation
of soil particles occurs due to polysaccharides coming from both
the plant root and associated microbes, Klusen said. Organic matter
encased by beneficial fungi (mycorrhizae) may be protected from
decomposition until penetration by another root, he noted.<BR>
<P>
KIusen is collaborating with <B>Rick Knoll</B>, an organic farmer
from Brentwood. The two are particularly interested in promoting
root growth by having weeder geese graze cover crops. When shoot
material is removed, plants invest more of their resources in
root growth, Knoll said. The plan is to contrast soil dynamics
in a grazed no-till cover crop versus a cover crop that is simply
disked under, he said. Klusen and Knoll are also exploring the
use of cover crops to encourage the growth of mycorrhizae which
will colonize the roots of vegetable crops. The fungi will help
improve nutrient-uptake efficiency, and reduce transplant shock.
<BR>
<H3>Potassium Deficiency</H3>
<P>
<B>Ken Cassman</B>, an assistant professor in the UC Davis agronomy
department, has been using barley and wheat as winter cover crops
to enhance potassium (K) availability to cotton. Extensive areas
of the San Joaquin Valley contain vermiculite in the soil, a mineral
that absorbs great amounts of K added as fertilizer, making the
K unavailable to cotton, Cassman said. There is some evidence
that added organic matter is gradually improving the K-response
of cotton at the field site, he noted. Humic acid, the largest
component of stable humus in soil also appears to be important
in maintaining K in a form available to plants, he said. Work
in progress is attempting to define this mechanism, Cassman said.
 The limited window for cover-crop use (December to early March)
means that cool-season grasses cannot contribute much biomass,
Cassman said. Because of this, he plans to use composted animal
manure to add organic matter, and contrast the cotton yields to
those obtained with fertilizers having the same nutrient value.
He expects plots with added manure to have higher yields of cotton.
<BR>
<H3>Orchards Under Cover</H3>
<P>
Cover crops can reduce compaction, and improve infiltration and
retention of water, but some covers may increase total water use
in almond orchards, according to <B>Terry Prichard</B>, a UC Davis
water management extension specialist. Prichard is evaluating
different cover crops and management practices in one mature and
one young almond orchard. The treatments were: 1) chemical mowing
(partial suppression of cover crop by herbicide); 2) solid coverage
residual herbicide; 3) uncontrolled resident weedy vegetation;
4) Blando brome grass planted as a cover crop; and 5) Salina strawberry
clover planted as a cover crop. Chemically-mowed resident cover
and Blando brome showed less water use and soil compaction, and
with increased water infiltration. Both resident cover and Salina
strawberry clover used more water, and solid coverage herbicide
reduced water infiltration. <BR>

<P>
In this demonstration project, conducted in Farmington, California,
cover crops and soil disturbance were evaluated for their effect
on water infiltration in a walnut orchard.  The study was begun
in the fall of 1990, and initially involved both walnuts and almonds.
 Due to poor cover crop stands, how-ever, the almond study was
discontinued.  In addition, the legume cover crops in the walnut
study did not survive the combined effect of the 1990-91 drought
and freeze. Therefore, researchers consolidated their efforts
in walnuts and all cover crops were replanted and became established
in the fall of 1991.<BR>
<P>
The study contrasted three annual legumes and three perennial
grass covers:<BR>
<P>
<I>Legumes</I>
<UL>
<LI>Berseem/crimson clover mix 
<LI>Subdover mix
<LI>Wild flower mix (trefoil, alyssum, and California poppy)
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<I>Grasses</I>
<UL>
<LI>Prairie home mix (perennial rye grass and creeping red fescue)
<LI>Tall fescue
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Hard fescue
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Each species or mix was planted in the aisle on both sides of
an entire tree row, and each treatment was replicated three times.
<BR>
<H3><B>Stand Establishment</B></H3>
<P>
During the winter, broadleaf weed species were quite competitive
with the grasses.  After mowing in late March, both the fescues
thrived and easily out-competed the weeds, while the prairie home
mix was somewhat patchy.  The clovers competed well before mowing,
and were quite dominant after mowing.  The wildflower mix grew
poorly, and became established only in the very few areas where
no other vegetation grew.<BR>
<H3><B>Water Infiltration</B></H3>
<P>
Water infiltration characteristics were measured using a portable,
rainfall simulator-type infiltrometer.  Water infiltration was
first measured under three soil surface conditions-undisturbed,
disturbed (raked), and disturbed re-crusted.  The results indicated
that mechanical stirring of both silty clay and sandy loam soils
broke up a crust and improved infiltration characteristics (figure
1).  Also, the presence of a crust decreased infiltration on both
sites below both the raked and undisturbed treatments.<BR>
<P>
A previous study showed that infiltration into sandy soils was
limited by a crust for an entire irrigation, resulting in a 50%
reduced infiltrated water volume compared to undisturbed soils.
Crusted clay soils were only influenced for the first 2 hours
of an irrigation, after which infiltration was limited only by
the soil's clay texture.<BR>
<P>
Water infiltration characteristics were measured under perennial
grass compared to a soil maintained free of weeds by herbicides
for an entire season.  For comparison, gypsum (used to improve
water infiltration) applied both through the soil and through
the water was also evaluated.<BR>
<P>
A huge increase in <I>initial </I>infiltration rate occurred in
the cover crop treatment compared to all other treatments (figure
2).  However, the steady state, or the sustained infiltration
rate, of  the cover was not significantly greater.  Therefore,
only an irrigation system which provides water at the maximum
rate of intake, such as furrow or flood irrigation, can benefit.
 Orchards irrigated with sprinkler systems, which apply a constant
precipitation rate, will not experience increased infiltration
over a typical 12 to 36 hour irrigation.<BR>
<P>
The improvement in water infiltration is a result of soil surface
protection from the mixing and sorting action of water flow or
water drop impact.  Also, improvements are a result of an increase
in soil organic matter, which improves soil structure.  The net
effect is a reduction in soil crust development.<BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
According to Vockeroth and Thompson (1987), the Syrphidae (Diptera)
comprise three subfamilies, 180 genera, and about 6,000 described
species.  Adults of many syrphid species resemble stinging bees
and wasps.  Larvae of some species are aphidophagous; these are
in the subfamily Syrphinae.  Common nonaphidophagous syrphids
on Californian farmlands include <I>Eristalis</I> spp., the larvae
of which live in liquified manure or in sewage ponds; <I>Eumerus
</I>spp., the larvae of which feed on bulbs of plants; and <I>Syritta
pipiens, </I>the larvae of which live in manure or compost.  The
uninitiated observer may mistake these for aphid predators.
<P>
Adult aphidophagous Syrphidae are frequent flower visitors, and
the morphology of the mouthparts suggests that certain species
are predominantly nectarivorous, where as others are pollinivorous
(Gilbert, 1981).  Adults require honeydew or nectar and pollen
to ensure reproduction, whereas larvae usually require aphids
to complete development (Schneider, 1969). This seems to indicate
that complementary foods are required for completion of the life
cycle. However, there are exceptions to the rules: lacking aphids,
larvae of several species can subsist on plant materials such
as pollen <I>(</I>e.g.,<I> Melanostoma </I>and<I> Allograpta obliqua-</I>Schneider<I>,
</I>1969; <I>Toxomerus</I> [<I>Mesograpta </I>sp.]-Cole and Schlinger,
1969).<BR>
<P>
Adult syrphids can be sampled by a variety of methods, including
visually scanning crops while walking, aerial netting, suction
traps, Malaise traps, and water traps.  For assessing eggs, larvae,
and pupae of aphidophagous Syrphidae, whole-plant removal from
the field and examination in the laboratory proved superior to
quick inspection of plots (while walking) and to detailed visual
inspection of plants in the field (Lapchin et al., 1987).  Keys
to Syrphidae are found in Cole and Schlinger (1969) (adults),
and Heiss (1938) (1arvae and puparia).
<H3>Aphidophagous Species</H3>
<P>
World-wide, there is a fairly large number of species of aphidophagous
syrphids.  For example, at least 49 species of Syrphidae attack
green peach aphid, <I>Myzus  persicae </I>(Sulzer) (Van Emden
et al., 1969).   Some of the aphidophagous syrphids most common
in California were described by Smith and Hagen (1956) as follows:
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>The large hover fly, <I>Scaeva pyrastri </I>(L.) may consume
over 500 aphids during its larval stages.  Adults are 1.27 cm
in length.  Abdomen is dark, with six white, curved stripes. 
Larvae are light green with a white dorsal longitudinal stripe.
<LI>The western hover fly, <I>Syrphus opinator </I>Osten Sacken:
adult is slightly smaller than S. pyrastri, has a yellow face,
is slightly smaller, and has two black spots and two bands extending
across the abdomen.  The larvae are spiny and yellow or brown.
<LI><I>Metasyrphus meadii </I>(Jones) is similar to S. <I>opinator
</I>but has black markings on the face, and the thorax is shiny.
<LI>The bird hover fly, <I>Eupeodes volucris </I>Osten Sacken:
the female looks similar to the large hover fly, but is only 0.85
cm long; males have a narrow cylinder at the tip of the abdomen.
<LI>The chevroned hover fly, <I>Allograpta obliqua </I>(Say) is
about 0.85 cm or less in length, and slenderer than E. <I>volucris.
 </I>This species has transverse yellow bands on the abdomen,
and two oblique yellow marks near the tip.  The larvae are smooth
and green, with a broad white median strip.  The breathing tubes
are prominent.
<LI><I>Sphaerophoria cylindrica </I>(Say) is about the same size
as A. <I>obliqua, </I>but has a narrow cylindrical abdomen.  Larvae
are greenish yellow and more or less transparent.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Syrphid Behavior</H3>
<P>
Aphid colonies are ephemeral resources: they can appear quickly
and just as suddenly disappear due to predation, parasitism, fungal
epizootics, declining host-plant quality, changes in weather,
or dispersal.  Therefore, it may be important to predators to
locate aphid infestations quickly. Because of their strong flight
and ability to hover and inspect foliage for aphids, syrphids
may be especially adept at this.  Based on mean number of aphids
on plants with predators divided by mean number of aphids on all
collard plants, syrphids sometimes appeared better at locating
aggregations of aphids on collards than were Coccinellidae (Coleoptera)
or Chrysopidae (Neuroptera) (Horn, 1981).<BR>
<P>
Aphidophagous syrphids are high-performance insects and, although
strong fliers, fare relatively poorly when weather is cold, wet,
or windy (Lewis, 1965a).  In the Sacramento Valley, <I>Eupeodes
</I>spp., <I>Scaeva pyrastri, </I>and <I>Syrphus</I> spp. are
often abundant from late spring through early summer, but seem
to disappear with the advent of hot weather.  By contrast, the
smaller species <I>Toxomerus </I>spp. and <I>Paragus tibialis
</I>(Fallen) are most common during the summer (Bugg and Wilson,
1989).  In coastal areas, the larger species often remain abundant
during the summer (Bugg, personal observation).<BR>
<P>
Adult females of several syrphid species determine whether to
oviposit based on the size of aphid colonies.  Several syrphid
species discriminate against older, larger colonies in favor of
smaller &quot;promising&quot; colonies (Kan, 1988a, b, c).  However,
syrphid species vary as to the size of aphid colonies or aggregations
&quot;preferred.&quot;  Chandler (1968a) showed that for <I>Platycheius
</I>spp. and <I>Syrphus ribesii </I>(L.), different aphid densities
elicited peak numbers of syrphid eggs per plant. Chandler (1968b)
reported that <I>Platycheirus manicatas </I>(Meigen) oviposited
selectively on uninfested plants adjoining those that are heavily
infested.  This response was seen to cabbage aphid <I>(Brevicoryne
brassicae </I>L.) on brussels sprouts, and to bean aphid <I>(Aphis
fabae </I>Scopoli) on faba bean.  Syrphids that oviposit on plants
that have been poorly colonized by aphids may be especially good
at keeping aphids at low densities.<BR>
<H3>Managing Vegetation to Enhance Biological Control by Syrphidae
</H3>
<P>
Wind inhibits activity by adult syrphids.  Hedgerows, windbreaks,
or shelterbelts can protect croplands in windy areas, and they
provide some protection to windward as well as to leeward. Shelter
can reduce soil erosion, and improve photosynthetic and water-use
efficiency by crop plants, and can lead to locally elevated temperatures
in the sheltered areas (Van Eimern, 1964). These practical considerations
raise the possibility of using wind shelter to enhance biological
control by aphidophagous syrphids.<BR>
<P>
Using segregating traps and painted pan traps containing water
and detergent, Lewis (1965a) showed that syrphids occurred in
areas sheltered by artificial windbreaks (0.915 m in height, made
with horizontal slats, 45 percent open area), and that of all
13 insect taxa assessed (diurnal and nocturnal), syrphids showed
by far the greatest tendency to concentrate in the sheltered area.
Aphids also settle selectively near shelter (Lewis, 1965b), so
the net effect of windbreaks on aphid control is in question.
<BR>
<P>
Because hedgerows and windbreaks often contain flowering plants
used by syrphids, effects of shelter and of flowers may be confounded.
 Bowden and Dean (1977) used suction traps to assess the distribution
of adult syrphids on both sides and at two distances from a high
(7 m) hedgerow. Prevailing wind did not seem to influence the
distribution: syrphids were consistently more abundant on the
western side, which was more diverse floristically.<BR>
<P>
Pollard (1971) believed that shelter influenced syrphid oviposition,
but that flowers did not.  In Pollard's experiment, potted brussels
sprouts plants were placed in various habitats, then retrieved
and inspected for syrphid eggs.  Adult syrphids were more abundant
in areas with flowers, but oviposition was depressed in unsheltered
areas, regardless of whether flowers occurred nearby.  However,
Pollard's was not a true factorial experiment, and the two factors
of interest were neither manipulated nor controlled.  The experiment
also lacked systematic interspersion of treatments and rigorous
statistical analysis.
<H3>Nectar and Pollen Sources</H3>
<P>
Floral resources are clearly valuable to adult syrphids.  Nectar
serves principally as an &quot;energy food&quot; to sustain the
strong flight; pollen sustains ovariole development (Schneider,
1969). Table 1 lists some of the nectar sources used by aphidophagous
syrphids, including a variety of trees, shrubs, and forbs.  The
table refers to research conducted in both North America and Europe.
 As indicated in table 1, flowers of some cover crops, such as
buckwheat <I>(Fagopyrum esculentum, </I>Polygonaceae) and tansy
phacelia <I>(Phacelia tanacetifolia, </I>Hydrophyllaceae) are
especially attractive to adult syrphids (see Ozols, 1964).  Sweet
alyssum<I> (Lobularia maritima, </I>Brassicaceae) flowers are
also heavily visited (Bugg, personal observation), and this species
is commonly included in proprietary &quot;insectary cover crop&quot;
seed mixes (e.g., Germain's Incorporated, Harmony Farm Supply,
Lohse Mill Inc., Pacific Coast Seed, Peaceful Valley Farm Supply)
(Bugg and Waddington, in press). Knuth (1908) compiled detailed
records of flower visitation by insects, including syrphids.<BR>
<P>
Effects of flowers on oviposition have proven difficult to demonstrate,
perhaps because of the difficulties of spatial scale encountered
with the highly vagile adult syrphids.  Distribution of syrphid
flies and their oviposition on brussels sprouts was related to
flowers, in an unreplicated study involving a hedgerow (Van Emden,
1965).  As mentioned earlier, Pollard (1971) contended that shelter
provided by hedges was important, but that flowers were not. 
For example, potted plants were located amid standing gram, which
was counted as &quot;shelter.&quot;  But grain fields, depending
on phenological stage, can also be sources of alternate prey or
pollen. Chandler (1968b) found that <I>Senecio jacobaea</I> (Asteraceae),
in buckets, did not influence oviposition by syrphids.  These
flowers were presumably cut, which can reduce the flow of nectar.
 This was not considered, although Chandler did suggest that syrphids
continued to visit the flowers.<BR>
<P>
By contrast, Sengonca and Frings (1988) showed apparent enhancement
of biocontrol in a two-year, replicated study, involving tansy
phacelia.  This annual forb is native to California and was introduced
as a bee plant to Europe during the early 1900's.  Tansy phacelia
was grown in interior strips, and in &quot;islands,&quot; in conjunction
with 200-m2 plots of sugarbeet.  Control plots featured monocultures
of sugarbeet.  Densities of bean aphid <I>(Aphis fabae) </I>and
eggs and larvae of aphidophagous hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae)
were highest in control plots.  In plots with phacelia, sugarbeet
yields were significantly higher, and adult syrphids (which feed
on floral nectar and pollen of phacelia, and were presumably attracted
thereby) were significantly more abundant. Syrphids were credited
with reducing the aphids in plots with phacelia. Aphidophagous
syrphids observed included <I>Episyrphus balteatus,</I> and<I>
Metasyrphus corollae Sphaerophoria scripta, Scaeva selenitica,
</I>and <I>Melanostoma scalare</I>.  As<I> </I>reported by Blake
(1990), Steven Wratten at the University of Southampton, England
is also using tansy phacelia to enhance activity of syrphids,
especially <I>Episyrphus</I> <I>balteatus </I>and <I>Metasyrphus
corollae. </I>Hoverflies with the distinctive star-shaped phacelia
pollen in their guts were collected as far as 200 m from strips
of flowering phacelia.
<H3>Alternate Prey</H3>
<P>
Only survey studies have been conducted on the possible role of
alternate prey in enhancing biocontrol by syrphids.  Bugg and
Ditcher (1989) evaluated several warm-season cover crops as sources
of alternate prey for aphidophaga: American jointvetch <I>(Aeschynomene
americana), </I>cowpea <I>(Vigna unguiculata </I>ssp. <I>unguiculata),
sesbania (Sesbania exaltata</I>), and hairy indigo<I> (Indigofera
hirsuta) </I>all supported cowpea aphid <I>(Aphis craccivora </I>Koch),
whereas a sorghum X sudangrass hybrid <I>(Sorghum bicolor) </I>hosted
corn leaf aphid <I>(Rhopalosiphum maidis </I>[Fitch]) and greenbug
<I>(Schizaphis graminum </I>[Rondani]).  Aphidophaga observed
included syrphid flies (e.g., <I>Allograpta obliqua </I>[Say],
<I>Ocyptamus fuscipennis </I>[Say], <I>Ocyptamus costatus </I>[Say],
<I>Pseudodoros clavatas </I>[Fabricius], <I>Sphaerophoria </I>spp.,
<I>Toxomerus boscii </I>Macquart, and <I>Toxomerus marginatus
</I>[Say]).  Sesbania appeared to be the best source of cowpea
aphid, and reservoir for pooled aphidophaga, including coccinellid
beetles and syrphid flies.  Densities of aphidophagous Syrphidae
were significantly different among cover crops on three of the
eleven dates assessed, September 10, 14, and 29; sesbania featured
the highest densities on all three.<BR>
<P>
Bugg et al. (1990) assessed aphidophagous Syrphidae in various
cool-season cover crops in southern Georgia.  <I>They observed
Allograpta obliqua </I>(Say), <I>Syrphus </I>sp., <I>Eupeodes
(Metasyrphus)</I> sp.,<I> and Toxomerus marginata </I>Say). Whole-plot
inspection for pooled aphidophagous syrphids indicated significant
differences among cover crops on 5 of the 19 sampling dates: 1)
Crimson clover and 'Cahaba White' vetch on February 22; 2) Crimson
clover and lentil on March 13; 3) Arrowleaf and crimson clovers
on March 30; 4) Arrowleaf clover, hairy vetch, 'Cahaba White'
vetch, and narrow-leafed lupin, on April 19.  Thus, significant
differences for adult aphidophagous Syrphidae were only seen on
a relatively few occasions. Adult syrphids seldom fly and may
seek concealed locations when the weather is windy, cold, or rainy,
and therefore may not have been observable on all sampling dates.
<BR>
<P>
Bugg and Ellis (1990) evaluated five prospective cover crops in
Falmouth, Massachusetts.  Four distinguishable taxa of aphidophagous
hover flies were observed.  A total of 725 syrphid adults were
observed, with the breakdown as follows (numbers of specimens
observed in parentheses): <I>Allograpta obliqua</I> (3),<I> Sphaerophoria
</I>spp. (55), <I>Syrphus </I>spp. (9), <I>Toxomerus </I>spp.
(658).  Thus, <I>Toxomerus </I>spp. represented over 90 percent
of the observations.  Buckwheat (a nectar source) showed the highest
densities on 3 dates; hairy vetch, <I>Vicia</I> <I>villosa </I>(infested
with pea aphid), did so on 2 dates (1 tie).
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
Local oviposition by syrphids may be more strongly influenced
by shelter than by flowers, though there are some conflicting
data.  It is difficult to demonstrate effects of flowers, probably
because adult syrphids are highly mobile, and benefits acquired
by pollen feeding (e.g., ovariole development) do not occur immediately.
 Moreover, nectar is an energy food and enables dispersal.  Therefore,
landscape-scale experiments may be needed.  I found no studies
on effects of alternate prey on syrphid efficiency in agroecosystems.
<BR>
<P>
Given the importance of syrphids in field, orchard, and vegetable
crops, further experiments on enhancement should be under-taken.

<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium fragiferum</I></B> L is its scientific name (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is a long lived perennial (Peaceful Valley, 1988) that roots at the the nodes of stolons (Gillett, 1985) and grows principally during the summer (McLeod, 1982).  Flowering is during June and July (Duke, 1981).  From 40-75% of seed may be hard.  The species can be seeded in fall or during spring where moisture is adequate.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>'Salina' attains a height of 8 to 12 inches (Finch & Sharp, 1983), or up to 14 inches (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Bugg et al. (unpublished) found that cv 'Salina' seeded in October had by the following May attained a mean height of 31.12 +/- 4.91 cm (mean +/- S.E.M.) (12.25 +/- 1.93 inches) in a Mendocino County organic vineyard.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is adapted to a wide range of soils (Duke 1981; McLeod, 1982), from loam to clay (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  It is said to be tolerant of alkali, high pH, salinity, short-term drought, and waterlogging (Duke, 1981).  It produces best on fertile, well drained soil (McLeod, 1982), and cv 'Salina' is said to be well adapted to all orchard and vinyard soil conditions (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover tolerates soil pH of 5.3-8.2, with the mean of 19 cases being 6.8 (Duke, 1981).  The species is tolerant of alkali (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982; Miller et al., 1989).  Cv 'Salina' has been called the most alkali-tolerant perennial clover (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sow seed fall-spring (Munoz & Graves, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988).  According to McLeod (1982), sowings in the fall, before cold weather, germinate better than spring sowings; Townsend (1985) stated that fall sowing is usually preferred in California.  By contrast, McLeod (1983) mentioned that weed control in the spring sowings may be easier since weeds can be mowed at the proper time; mowing for weed control in fall sowings may often be delayed because of wet soils.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates were variously given as 2-5 kg/ha (Duke, 1981), 3-6 kg/ha (Townsend, 1985), 5-15 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988; Miller et al., 1989), 6-10 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982), 9 lb/acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983), and 12-15 lb/acre (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed cost was $4.00/lb (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price for cv 'Salina' as $2.67/lb in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Nitrogen content of strawberrry clover has been estimated at 125 lb/acre for 'Salina' (Peaceful Valley, 1988), and from 100-300 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), strawberry clover tolerates mean annual precipitation of 4.4-11.6 dm, with a mean of 20 cases of 7.0.  It is tolerant of wet, waterlogged soils, and survives flooding for 1-2 months; it can also survive in dry areas and tolerates short droughts.  According to Munoz & Graves (1988) it requires 30 inches of water.  It grows best where moisture is plentiful (McLeod, 1982), yet requires fewer irrigations than ladino clover when soil is porous (McLeod, 1982).<P> In Californian regions with 36 to 40 inches of rainfall per year and a rain-free period of 90 to 100 days, strawberry clover will produce continuously without irrigation (McLeod, 1982).<P> Strawberry clover is tolerant of infrequent irrigation (Miller et al., 1989) and as of 1992 had survived for 3 years in unirrigated roadside prairie plantings at John H. Anderson's Hedgerow Farms, Yolo County, California (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Prichard et al. (1989) found that almond orchards with strawberry clover as a cover crop required up to about 1/3 more irrgiation water on average than those using 'Blando' brome as a cover crop or those with residual herbicide or chemically-mowed resident vegetation.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover requires a special strain of <I>Rhizobium trifolii</I></B>, "Trifolium Special Culture No. 6" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover will tolerate shade (Munoz & Graves, 1988) but is usually paired with Dutch white (ladino) clover in orchards because the latter is more shade tolerant (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover has a prostrate, spreading habit (Munoz & Graves, 1988); its thick growth allows it to smother weeds (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  It is stoloniferous (Miller et al., 1989); stolons root at the nodes (Gillett, 1985), and roots may extend to a depth of 1 m (Townsend, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is seldom used for hay because of its low stature, but it is used in lawns, permanent pasture, green manure, and is a good bee plant (Duke, 1981).<P> Strawberry clover is viable on swampy ground because it tolerates waterlogging (McLeod, 1982), and it is the hardiest perennial clover species available for Californian orchards and vineyards (Miller et al., 1989).  Its forage production is poor in the summer (Finch & Sharp, 1983), yet cv 'Salina' is usable in orchards, vineyards, and other perennials where a low-growing, heat tolerant year round clover is desirable (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Cv 'Salina' shows a low, thick, weed-smothering growth habit (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> Strawberry clover cv 'Salina' was sown as a vineyard cover crop in Mendocino County, California, in late October and harvested in mid-May.  Weed biomass was 3.540+/-0.704 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M. (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass. Vegetational cover by the clover was 62.50+/-10.51% (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Although common strawberry clover is self-fertile, the 'Salina' variety is self-sterile and needs cross pollination (McLeod, 1982). Duke (1981) mentioned that strawberry clover is a good honey plant, so cross pollination is presumably by bees.<P> Duke (1981) discussed seed production and harvesting as follows. Cattle should be removed by June 1 to allow flowering and seed development.  Cut the heads when most seed envelopes are light brown, and slightly damp, to avoid loss of seed due to shattering. Closely-set windrowing attachments or bunchers on mowers are useful in reducing the number of times a crop must be handled, and thus reducing losses due to shattering.  Vacuum collection of seed can be done if the soil surface is smooth.  Seed yields range from 40-300 kg/ha, and the mean is about 100 kg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover tolerates mean annual temperatures of 6.6-21.8 C, with a mean of 20 cases of 11.9 (Duke, 1981).  McLeod (1982) listed it is a warm-season plant that will tolerate temperature extremes.  'Salina' is not so winter hardy as common strawberry clover, which can withstand snow cover (McLeod, 1982).  Yet 'Salina' strawberry clover is more cold tolerant than the Australian cultivar 'Palestine', from which it was derived (Carlson et al., 1985).<P> Peaceful Valley (1988) and Miller et al. (1989) remarked that the species is tolerant of heat and full sun exposure.<P> Seedlings express salt tolerance best when weather is cool (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>This species is tolerant of salinity (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982), showing good growth in combination with saltgrasses and sedges at 1% salinity and with established stands persisting in the face of salinity of over 3%.  In overly-saline pastures, strawberry clover may look overgrazed, and flower heads are short stalked (Duke, 1981).  Seedlings express salt tolerance better with cool weather (Duke, 1981).  The species will grow on salty soils along tidal streams (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>According to Townsend (1985), on dry soils, strawberry clover roots penetrate to about 1 m, but are confined to the upper 8-10 cm on wet, saline soils.  McLeod (1982) stated that taproots will descend 2 to 4 feet when there is no sub-surface hardpan.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is more susceptible to <I>Sclerotinia</I></B> (McLeod, 1982; Townsend, 1985) and crown rot (Townsend, 1985) diseases than is ladino clover; the <I>Sclerotinia</I></B> fungus is favored by cool, wet conditions.  Duke (1981) reported 12 species of fungi as having been isolated from strawberry clover.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Even after seed are hulled, 40-75% may be hard (Duke, 1981). Seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>There are several varieties available: 'Palestine,' developed in Australia, is large and productive, but is susceptible to frost; 'Salina' is better adapted to California (Duke, 1981).  Other varieties include 'Fresa' (Slayback, pers. comm.) and 'O'Conners,' an Australian variety (Miller et al, 1989).  Gillett (1985) listed five botanical varieties, distinguished by morphological characters: <I>majus</I></B>, <I>modestum</I></B>, <I>pulchellum</I></B>, <I>orthodon</I></B>, and <I>fragiferum</I></B>.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Seedlings are vigorous (Slayback, pers. comm.) but less so than those of white clover (Townsend, 1985).  Seedlings express salt tolerance better when weather is cool (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), strawberry clover is native to Eurasia and inhabits the Cool Temperate Steppe to Wet through Warm Temperate Thorn to Moist Forest Life Zones.  It is assigned to the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Centers of Diversity, and has been introduced to Australia, New Zealand, and to the United States, where it is naturalized in the North.  With irrigation, it does well in most of California (Slayback, pers. comm.), but it was not listed by Munz (1973) as naturalized in California.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding depths are 1 cm (Townsend, 1985), 1/4-1/2 inches (Peaceful Valley, 1988), and 1/2 inch (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Drill or broadcast methods are suggested (Slayback, pers. comm.); drilling scarified seed gives the best stands, but unscarified seed may be sown on unprepared seedbeds in the late winter (Townsend, 1985).  If seedbeds cannot be prepared, existing vegetation should be mowed or removed before seeding (Townsend, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed availability is fair to good (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>McKenry (pers. comm.) found that cv 'Salina' is a host for <I>Meloidogyne hapla</I></B> but does not appear to be a good winter host for <I>M.  javanica, M. incognita</I></B> or <I>M.  arenaria</I></B>.<P> Duke (1981) reported that the following nematodes have been isolated from strawberry clover: <I>Ditylenchus dipsaci</I></B>, <I>Heterodera galeopsidis</I></B>, <I>Heterodera trifolii</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne javanica</I></B>,and <I>Pratylenchus penetrans</I></B>.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>The common name is strawberry clover (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Gillett (1985), strawberry clover is a pubsecent or glabrous perennial with prostrate or creeping branching stems 0.5-5 dm long, rooting at the nodes and with erect petioles and peduncles.  Leaves congested or loose; petioles long, pilose.  Stipules long, lanceolate, dilated and white chartaceous towards the base and with subulate free part. Corolla white to pink.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Based on observations at John Anderson's farm in Winters, CA, strawberry clover attracts gophers; it is not clear whether this increases pest problems from gophers, or diverts them from feeding on crop plants (Bugg, R.L, Pers. Comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Cv 'Salina' has been termed a good beneficial insect attractor (Peaceful Valley, 1988), but Bugg (pers. comm.) stated that it appears to harbor relatively low densities of key beneficial insects.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Grazing (or, presumably, mowing) can be used after strawberry clover is established, to reduce competition by barley or other plants (Townsend, 1985).<P> In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes.  In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November.  Strawberry clover peaked in November. By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> On P-deficient soils, P2O5 addition increases production (Townsend, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover tolerates mowing (Finch & Sharp, 1983; Munoz & Graves, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988; Miller et al., 1989) and grazing (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Grazing (or, presumably, mowing) can be used after strawberry clover is established, to reduce competition by barley or other plants; strawberry clover tolerates close, continuous grazing (Townsend, 1985).<P> In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> According to Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990), strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit, but differ in response to changes in nutrient and grazing regimes. In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that strawberry clover does well in mixture with saltgrasses and sedges at 1% salinity and is tolerant of weeds, and that barley is the only salt-tolerant annual suitable for mixed seedings on saline sites. In Californian orchards, the heat-tolerant strawberry clover is often grown in mixture with shade-tolerant white or ladino clover (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In roadside prairie mixes at John H.  Anderson's Hedgerow Farms (Winters, Yolo County, California), strawberry clover has persisted for 4 years in combinations with sheep fescue (<I>Festuca ovina</I></B> cv 'Covar'), meadow barley (<I>Hordeum brachyantherum</I></B>) or perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B>), without irrigation (R.L. Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass (Kanyama-Phiri et al., 1990).<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990) further found that in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, the clovers were most productive with 60 kg/ha of N added. Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit, but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes.  In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that strawberry clover is tolerant of alkalinity, salinity, and waterlogged soils.  P2O5 is sometimes added to soils to compensate for P deficiency (Townsend, 1985).<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990) found that in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, the clovers were most productive with 60 kg/ha of N added. Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit, but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes.  In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November.  Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Biomass harvests were made on May 15-16, 1991 for cover crops seeded during October, 1990, in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Dry above-ground biomass was 1.866+/-0.607 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  for 'Salina' strawberry clover (Bugg et al., unpublished data); this was only 37.9% of the weed biomass in unseeded control plots.  When weeds were included, biomass was 5.405+/-0.620 ( Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  In the same trial, biomass of strawberry and white clovers in mixture was 3.941 +/-0.872 Mg/ha.<P> When strawberry clover is grown in mixes with grasses such as dallis grass (<I>Paspalum dilatatum</I></B> Poir.), total biomass production can be 18 Mg/ha-year (Townsend, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is highly tolerant to 2,4-D and glyphosate applications as well as other herbicides.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Flowering of this perennial occurs principally in May and June (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Seed presumably is mature in July (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>The following is based on Duke (1981).  If moisture is adequate, strawberry clover may be spring sown with a companion grain crop. Barley is suitable on saline sites.  On prepared seedbeds, competition from other plants is seldom a problem during establishment.  If seed is broadcast with no seedbed preparation, rushes and sedges should be mowed.  Strawberry clover withstands trampling and grazing better than other, competing plants.<P> Strawberry clover requires 25 days to germinate, therefore in sandy soils, sufficient irrigation will be needed to keep the seedling from dying, especially with a spring planting.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Seed crop should be cut when seed envelopes are light brown. Ripe heads shatter readily, so cut when heads are damp and envelopes are tough.  Mow, then pick up from swath or windrow. Vacuums have been used for harvest, where soil surface is smooth. Seed crop may be cured in windrows or stacks, then picked up from these and threshed by clover hullers or combines having hulling attachments (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>A seed crop may be cured in windrows or stacks, then picked up from these and threshed by clover hullers or combines having hulling attachments (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>As summarized by Townsend (1985), strawberry clover grown on saline soils shows elevated Mg, Na, K, and P concentrations, but reduced N and Ca as compared with the same species on non-saline soils.

<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Prichard et al. (1989) found that a cover crop of strawberry clover in almond orchards could increase water use by about 25% over that observed in bare orchards.<P> Field observations on clay soils suggested that strawberry clover will greatly (25-40%) improve water infiltration due to the shrinking and swelling of the taproot opening up channels.  (Neil Phillips, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>There can be reduced sunburning and sandblasting where strawberry clover is grown as a cover crop.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Taproots open up compacted soil.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Strawberry clover is as good a livestock feed as white clover; used with good results by poultry and mammalian livestock (Duke, 1981)<P> While noted as a non-bloating clover, Monte Bell did observe bloat in a pure stand at Williams, CA at the La Grande Ranch ca. 1985. Otherwise strawberry clover is a primary component of all non- bloating pasture mixes in California.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), seeds are ovoid-truncate and spotted with light brown, there are 661,000 seeds/kg, and seed may be 40-75% hard even after hulling.  Gillett (1985) described the seeds as 1-1.2 mm long, reniform, and brown spotted.<P>

<P>
Five years ago, we reviewed a research paper detailing the results
of the first phase of a cropping systems experiment conducted
at the Rodale Research Center in east-central Pennsylvania [Liebhardt
et al. (1989), reviewed in Components 2(2):2-3].  Three different
farming systems were compared (Table 1):  low-input/livestock,
low-input/cash grain and conventional.   Each system was monitored
for: 1) grain and hay yields, 2) corn dry matter production, 3)
leaf tissue nutrient concentrations of corn, soybean, small grains,
4) green manure biomass and nutrient content, 5) animal manure
nutrient content and quantity applied, and 6) weed biomass in
both corn and soybean.  The experiment underwent a typical conversion
scenario where the productivity of the land converted from conventional
to low-input management was suppressed for a few years, after
which yields rebounded to equal or exceed those in conventionally
managed plots. Results of this study pointed to three principles
that growers could use as they planned for conversion from conventional
to lower-input or organic systems.
<P>
1) Begin with crops that have a low nitrogen requirement or that
fix their own nitrogen. Initial crops should also be able to compete
against the weeds present in the field. 
<P>
2) Shift between warm- and cool-season crops in the rotation.
This practice disrupts the life cycles of various weeds and reduces
competition in alternating crops. 
<P>
3) Facilitate the transition period by gradually reducing fertilizer
and pesticide inputs. Herbicides can be banded and used in conjunction
with cultivation; nitrogen fertilizers can be used to supplement
nutrients added from animal or green manures.
<P>
The current article examines the role that organic matter plays
in how the different farming systems function.  In fact, total
soil organic  matter as measured over the course of the experiment
was not particularly useful in monitoring soil quality or predicting
the effects of various management practices.  However, the transition
effect (rebounding productivity after a period of several years)
may actually be associated with more subtle beneficial changes
in the biologically active fraction of soil organic matter, according
to the authors.  The overall objective of  their research was
to investigate the popular concept that &quot;sustainable&quot;
management practices enhance that particular fraction of soil
organic matter which is biologically active. This hypothesis was
addressed by measuring soil biological activity (soil respiration),
soil nitrogen supply capacity (available inorganic and mineralized
nitrogen), water-dispersible organic matter pools, and particulate
soil organic matter pools in the three farming systems.<BR>

<H3>Results and Discussion</H3>

<P>
After ten years, net changes in total soil organic matter were
small (Table 2). Increases in the animal-based system, for example,
averaged only a few tenths of a percent between 1981 and 1991.
 But this bulk measurement does not adequately represent the important
changes and dynamics involved in other soil organic matter characteristics.
Results of this experiment show that two kinds of organic matter
change were at work in the  alternative systems:  1) accumulation
of biologically active soil organic matter; and 2) accumulation
of more stable, yet still labile, soil organic matter.<BR>

Biologically active soil organic matter was most closely associated
with measurements of soil nitrogen supply and soil biological
activity. The animal-based rotation improved this organic matter
fraction the most, based on the apparent rates of soil organic
matter turnover and biological  activity, which were greater in
this treatment than in the other two treatments (Figure 1).
<P>
The more stable (but still labile) organic matter pool, on the
other hand, was more closely associated with the particulate soil
organic matter fraction, and showed greatest accumulations in
the cover cropped plots (Figure 2).  Even though respiration rates
were greater in the cover cropped soil than in the conventionally
managed soil, and even though the  cover cropped soil received
the least total carbon (based on inputs of aboveground residues),
it was still a better net carbon sink than the other systems.
 The reason for this phenomenon appears to be that this particulate,
or LF (light fraction), organic matter is stabilized or protected
to some degree in the soil matrix. Therefore, although the LF
organic matter is accessible to microorganisms, it metabolizes
more slowly  than the active fraction.  One study has shown it
has an intermediate turnover rate averaging about 2.31 years (Jenkinson
and Rayner, 1977). Additionally, Rodale researchers report that
the LF or particulate organic matter in their experiment had roughly
three times more nitrogen than the surrounding soil solution.
 Under these conditions, the moderately stable organic matter
that can accumulate in legume cover cropped systems is  reported
to adequately meet nutrient supply demands of most agricultural
systems.
<P>
In summary, 
<P>
<I>&#133;accumulated organic matter in the manure-amended soil
was the most labile whereas the cover cropped soil accumulated
the most organic matter overall. In the cover cropped soil, higher
total carbon and nitrogen, particulate soil organic matter, and
reduced water-dispersible organic matter indicated that its soil
organic matter was more stable than  organic matter in the other
two treatment soils.  The conventionally managed soil had the
lowest biological activity (nitrogen supply and soil respiration
rates) and did not accumulate soil organic matter during the 10-year
experiment.</I>
<P>
From these results, the authors conclude that the LF organic matter
is a functionally important soil organic matter pool, and that
assays of the particulate residues that make up this fraction
may provide the best characterization of the quality and quantity
of organic matter in agricultural soils and, ultimately, the performance
of cropping systems based on those soils.

<H1>1993 national organic farmers' survey.</H1>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Organic Farming Research Foundation. 1994<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In 1993 the Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) mailed
an eight-page survey to every certified organic farmer in the
United States that belonged to any of the fifty-four organic verification
organizations and chapters that would share their lists with OFRF.
 Five hundred fifty surveys (20%) were returned from growers in
39 states.<BR>

<P>
The survey was designed and conducted by Erica Walz and Bob Scowcroft
of OFRF, in consultation with a survey advisory committee comprising
<A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Auburn</A>, Associate Director, UC SAREP; Brian Baker, Technical
Program Coordinator, CCOF; Faustino Munoz, UC Cooperative Extension,
San Diego County; and Harry MacCormack, former Research and Education
Director, Oregon Tilth.<BR>

<H3>Survey Results</H3>

<P>
<B>Information Resources.</B>  Approximately SS percent of organic
farmers consult newsletters and magazines for information; the
same proportion obtain information from other farmers.  A smaller
but still significant portion of the respondents (greater than
50%) get information from catalogs and books, by attending meetings,
and consulting suppliers, buyers, and extension advisors.  Substantially
fewer organic farmers use electronic media (TV, video, radio,
audio and computer), but those who do may use them quite frequently
(e.g., 27 times per year for radio; 12 times per year for computers).
<BR>

<P>
Organic farmers rate other farmers the most useful source of information,
followed closely by newsletters, magazines, and all types of meetings.
 Electronic media are considerably less useful as rated by all
farmers in the survey, but those who report using them rate them
about as high as some other people that they consult (suppliers,
buyers, and extension advisors).  About one- third of the farmers
surveyed said that they felt that existing sources of information
generally met their information needs on organic farming; about
sixty percent said they did not, and a small percentage did not
reply.<BR>

<P>
<B>Organic Farming Research.</B>  Nearly one-third of the farmers
surveyed have participated in on-farm organic farming research
projects.  The farmers provide the land most of the time, and
define the problem for study and provide labor for the research
more than half the time.  They frequently provide financial support
and materials and equipment (40-45% of the time), but less commonly
(10-20% of the time) publish or distribute the research results.
 Over 80 percent of the farmers said that they would be interested
in participating in on-farm organic research projects if the resources
were available.<BR>

<P>
Organic farmers' high priorities for research span a wide range
of topics including consumer demand for organic products, the
relationship of growing practices to crop quality and nutrition,
and the relationship between plant nutrition and resistance to
pests.  Other high-priority topics include crop rotation, soil
biology, public policy, marketing, cover crops, green manures,
and habitat management and other approaches to pest control. 
Figure 1 shows what organic farmers consider to be their worst
pests.<BR>

<P>
<B>Commodities and Markets.  </B>Most of the farmers surveyed
(over 60%) grow vegetables.  Herbs, tree fruit, field crops, root
crops, vine fruit, or flowers are each grown by at least one fourth
of the farmers.  Greenhouse crops, beef cattle, and eggs are each
grown by 10-20 percent of the farmers.  Livestock are most frequently
used as a fertilizer source for use on the farm, and somewhat
less often as a primary or secondary source of income.  The median
number of commodities grown is between 6 and 10, although more
than 20 percent of the farmers grow over 25 commodities.<BR>

<P>
Nearly half the farmers sell direct on-farm and nearly half sell
to wholesalers.  Farmers' markets, restaurants, and retail stores
are also popular outlets (about one-third sell to each).  Over
two-thirds of the farmers marketed 76-100 percent of their produce
as organic in 1992.<BR>

<P>
<B>Demographics.  </B>Organic farms are family farms: 84 percent
of respondents are sole proprietors or family partnerships.  Nearly
half of them made 25 percent or less of their 1992 net family
income from farming, but nearly one-fourth made 76-100 percent
of their 1992 net family income from farming.  The median gross
income from the farm in 1992 was $15,000 to $30, 000, but about
one-fifth of the farms grossed $100,000 or more.<BR>

<P>
The respondents have been farming, on average, sixteen years,
ten of them organically, and they average 46 years old.  Three-fourths
are male.  Over two-thirds have completed college, and one-fifth
hold graduate degrees, in everything from anthropology to zoology.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A report of The Biotechnology Project, Wisconsin
Rural Development Center. 1993<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A key concern for sustainable agriculture is the content of the
land grant research agenda. Sustainable agriculture advocates
ask: To what extent does this agenda serve the needs and interests
of farmers, farmworkers and rural communities? To what extent
does it serve the needs of academic researchers and corporations?
And, most importantly, who controls the agenda?<BR>

<P>
This brief report addresses these questions within the context
of the University of Wisconsin's College of Agricultural and Life
Sciences. The authors sought to determine the extent to which
grants from the biotechnology industry were shaping that college's
research activities. While limited in scope, the study's methods
and findings will interest those who are pursuing similar questions
elsewhere, including California.<BR>

<H3>Methodology<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Researchers from the Biotechnology Project of the Wisconsin Rural
Development Center (a private non-profit group) conducted a thorough
review of 39 research agreements between College of Agricultural
and Life Sciences (CALS) faculty and various funding entities,
both private and public. They focused their attention on 21 contracts
with business entities that involved biotechnology research. The
researchers asked whether university policies and practices impact
the ability of CALS to perform its public function of setting
and responding to the state's agricultural agenda.<BR>

<P>
The corporations entering contracts to fund the research projects
include four biotechnology companies (Forgene, Advanced Genetic
Sciences, Agracetus, Agrigenetics), one pharmaceutical firm (Unimed),
seven chemical/pharmaceutical corporations (Eli Lilly, W.R. Grace,
American Cyanamid, S.C. Johnson, Du Pont, Pitman Moore, International
Minerals and Chemical), two food companies (Campbell Soup Company
and Nutrasweet Company), a diversified household products company
(Proctor and Gamble), and one commodity group (National Dairy
Promotion and Research Board). The principal investigators represented
the departments of bacteriology, biochemistry, horticulture, meat
and animal science, plant pathology, dairy science and veterinary
science. The projects ranged from six months to several years
in length, and from $8,400 to $603,484 in funding. Total support
for CALS research for the 21 contracts was $3,075,094.<BR>

<H3>Conclusions<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The report finds that private industry support for biotechnology
research alters the &quot;terms, structure, and objectives&quot;
of CALS research. Industry money leverages public investments
in salaries and infrastructure to pursue private ends. As the
authors put it:<BR>

<P>
&quot;Over 80% of the CALS research budget comes from public funds,
both state and federal, while 12% comes from industry and commodity
groups. State funds are used largely to pay salaries and other
fixed costs. Relatively little remains for specific research projects.
By funding a specific research project, industry sponsors, with
relatively small amounts of discretionary spending, are able to
obtain public facilities and publicly funded researchers for their
private research agenda.&quot; (p.1)<BR>

<P>
A number of specific policies and procedures facilitate the subsidy
to industry. For example, the investigators found that 13 of the
21 research contracts studied paid less than the university's
federally audited overhead rate. Since that overhead rate represents
the amount the university needs to break even in conducting the
research, this means that taxpayer dollars are paying for the
difference. While there might be legitimate public reasons to
subsidize particular research projects, the researchers found
&quot;no set of criteria by which administrators are to judge
the importance of projects.&quot; They add, &quot;it is not immediately
apparent why these 13 projects were sufficiently important to
warrant over $300,000 of public subsidy.&quot;<BR>

<P>
The authors note that no mechanism exists for obtaining citizen
input into this agenda-setting process. While ordinary taxpayers
pay most of the costs of running the university, they have little
say in deciding how researchers use their time. The report recommends
that a university-industry relations committee be formed to decide
and monitor what constitutes &quot;fair and appropriate&quot;
contract provisions with industry. A significant portion of the
membership of this committee would be from the public at large.
<BR>

<P>
Other problems were uncovered by the WRDC study. In some instances,
University of Wisconsin policies allowed university researchers
to assign patent rights to corporate sponsors as a condition of
receiving the grant. In other cases, industry support was predicated
on agreements that restricted the free flow of information, especially
where trade secrets or other proprietary information was used
in carrying out the research. Also, many of the university's topflight
researchers received lucrative consulting contracts with the industries
that sponsor their research, raising questions about whose interests
are being served and when.<BR>

<P>
The authors are concerned that these problems will grow more severe
as research funds become scarcer. Rather than blaming the researchers,
they conclude that University of Wisconsin policies do not sufficiently
protect researchers from industry pressure to dictate the terms
of research. They conclude: &quot;The loose rules governing research
contracts leave many researchers vulnerable to pressure from corporate
sponsors who are free to withhold funding if their conditions
are not met.&quot;<BR>

<H3>Reviewer's Comments<BR>
</H3>

<P>
This report from Wisconsin raises issues that are becoming increasingly
critical in California. As public support for the University of
California declines, and as industry seeks to spend less on in-house
research, the practice of &quot;technology transfer&quot; from
university to industry is being promoted as a mutually beneficial
solution. Many of California's approximately 350 biotechnology
companies already have established close links with universities.
The UC system is actively considering new ways to promote technology
transfer, including possible creation of an independent foundation
to fund university research and development in return for the
right to license new technology. According to a recent study,
UC's systemwide Patent, Trademark and Copyright Office already
expects to earn approximately $22 million yearly from licensing
technologies discovered by UC researchers (Postlewait et al.,
1993). Most of this money comes from biomedical research at UC
San Francisco, but UC Davis ranks second among the campuses, generating
royalties of approximately $2.5 million per year. Of this amount,
$2 million comes from plant-related patents, an area where biotechnology
appears poised to make major advancements in the near future.
<BR>

<P>
For advocates of sustainable agriculture, the questions raised
by these developments include the following: If land-grant universities
increasingly define their mission as developing and transferring
technology to commercial interests, what will happen to the broader
goals and constituencies that land-grants were originally created
to serve? Will industry interests, however valid, exclude from
the agenda competing social interests? Will the effort to upgrade
salaries and facilities in order to attract industry-funded research
drain funds from research and extension services that directly
aid farmers, farmworkers and rural communities?<BR>

<P>
The study by Postlewait et al. concludes that efforts to transfer
biotechnology in agriculture will not be cost effective unless
the personnel and resources of Cooperative Extension play a significant
role. But they end their analysis on a cautionary note:<BR>

<P>
&quot;By its very nature, biotechnology tends toward privatization.
An overemphasis on the promise of biotechnology may mean that
agricultural problems that can be effectively solved through cultural
practices (e.g., crop rotation) may instead be addressed with
high-tech product-oriented solutions. It is best if expertise
in biotechnology comprises a component in the Cooperative Extension
portfolio, but is not the only part.&quot; (p.16)<BR>

<P>
If the Wisconsin study is any indication, many land grant universities
are currently ripe for just the sort of &quot;overemphasis&quot;
these authors fear. Few have adequate mechanisms for insuring
that the research and extension agenda are oriented toward the
broad public good rather than primarily by commercial interests.
Opinions on the proper role of various biotechnologies in the
future of agriculture vary, and land grants must consider the
interests of <U>all</U> of their constituents before moving forward.
A detailed study of UC research policies and practices similar
to that conducted in Wisconsin is certainly in order.<BR>

<H1>Sources of Funding</H1>
<H3>CDFA Fertilizer Research &amp; Education Program</H3>
<P>
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is soliciting
proposals for its Fertilizer Research and Education Grants Program.
 Research or education projects that will improve fertilizer use
efficiency and reduce groundwater contamination will be considered.
 Possible topics include water management related to nitrogen
use efficiency and the reduction of groundwater contamination,
fertilization practices, ways to determine acceptable levels of
nitrogen in soil at fertilizer facilities, and Proposition 65<I>
</I>chemical and employee/customer exposure.  Targeted audiences
may include growers, fertilizer dealers, students, teachers, and
the general public.  New project proposals should be submitted
through the Regular Approval Process (RAP).  Projects already
underway and expected to be completed within one year from fund
disbursement may submit proposals through the Expedited Approval
Process (EAP).  Multiple-year proposals will be accepted.  All
interested parties are encouraged to apply for funding.  EAP proposals
are due April 4, 1991, and project suggestion sheets for RAP proposals
are due April 30.  For applications and a complete description
of the proposal process, contact Jacques Franco or Barbara Elliot,
 California Department of Food and Agriculture, 1220 N St., Sacramento,
CA 94271-0001 or call (916) 322-6832.
<H3>Organic Farming Research Foundation</H3>
<P>
 The Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF) was established
in August 1990 after almost two years of planning.  &quot;Formal
establishment of the Organic Farming Research Foundation realizes
a long-standing dream of organic farmers, to play a role in the
development of America's farming research agenda and better educate
the public on ecologically sound farming practices,&quot; said
Mark Nielsen, OFRF president. <BR>
<P>
 Foundation objectives are to conduct research into Organic farming
methods, including soil building, pest and weed control, fertilizer
and soil amendments, agricultural economics, animal husbandry,
and alternative growing practices; to disseminate through publications
and lectures the results of organic farming research to organic
farmers; and to provide the public with information about methods,
practices and current developments in organic farming.<BR>
<P>
OFRF was founded by grower members of California Certified Organic
Farmers (CCOF).  The Columbia Foundation provided a $25,000 grant
for the first year.  Private donations and other foundation grants
are being sought.  Funds will be used to support research and
education activities conducted by CCOF and by other research and
educational organizations.  Early proposals by OFRF board members
include underwriting an organic farming show on regional public
radio; publishing a directory of suppliers of organic seeds, transplants,
and other inputs; and providing a cash award for the best article
published in 1991 educating the general public about organic farming.
 Priorities for funding research projects and other educational
projects are being determined, in part by analyzing a farmer survey
recently developed by OFRF's research and education committee.
<BR>
<P>
The foundation's board of directors includes seven organic farmers,
two agricultural researchers, one consumer representative, and
the president of CCOF.  The two agricultural researchers are SAREP's
<B>Jill Auburn</B>, chair of the foundation's research and education
committee, and UC Farm Advisor <B>Faustino Munoz</B>.<BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;We are looking for research suggestions from all sectors
of the agricultural community,&quot; said Munoz. &quot;We anticipate
the results of our OFRF-sponsored research to be of interest to
all growers.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
For a copy of the OFRF's goals and objectives, write to:  OFRF,
P.O. Box 440, Santa Cruz, CA 95061 or leave a message on the foundation's
message machine at (408) 426-6606.
<H3>No SAREP Grants</H3>
<P>
SAREP will not offer a Request for Proposals (RFP) in 1991, as
grant money is currently committed to multiple year projects.
 When funding is available for another round of grants, it will
be announced in <B>Sustainable Agriculture News</B>, and a copy
of the RFP will be mailed to everyone on the newsletter's mailing
list.  (Remember to fill out and return the mail update form on
page 17 or you will be dropped from the mailing list.)<BR>

<H3>Sustainable Landscape<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<I>Gray World, Green Heart: Technology, Nature, and the Sustainable
Landscape,</I> 352 pages, 1994, by <B>Robert L. Thayer, Jr.,</B>
John Wiley a Sons, Inc. Thayer, a professor of landscape architecture
and environmental design at UC Davis, writes that from Mall of
America to CityWalk in Universal City to Disney World in Orlando,
Florida to the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, creating and enjoying
fantasy environments is an American obsession. It seems easier,
he writes, to make superficial copies of the landscape rather
than to save the actual landscape. But now Americans are at a
crossroads, even feeling &quot;environmental guilt&quot; over
technological changes to the landscape. Thayer argues this crossroads
demands that people consider the landscape in terms of sustainability.
To order the book, send $39.95 to John Wiley &amp; Sons, lnc.,
605 Third Ave., New York, NY 10158 or call (800) 225-5945 ext.

<H3>Nitrogen Fertilizer Video<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<I>Best Management Practices for Nitrogen Fertilizer and Water
Use in Irrigated Agriculture</I>, 30 minutes, 1993, produced by
the California Department of Food and Agriculture's Fertilizer
Research and Education Program (FREP). Widespread use of nitrogen
fertilizer has created concerns about nitrate groundwater contamination.
This video is the first in a series to help growers improve the
way fertilizer and water is used to reduce potential nitrate groundwater
contamination and increase profitability. It includes information
on how to improve timing and placement of nitrogen fertilizer,
sample and analyze soils for residual nitrate content, application
of organic amendments to croplands, and use of nitrification inhibitors
with certain fertilizers. Water management suggestions include
using drip irrigation to reduce deep percolation and runoff from
croplands, using surge flow techniques with furrow irrigation,
and adjusting sprinkler irrigation rates based on soil type and
slope. A second video specifically for vegetable growers is scheduled
for release in mid 1994. The video and study guide are available
for $20 from <B>Debbie</B> <B>Scott</B> or <B>Casey Walsh</B>

<H1>The fate of lawn care pesticides during composting.</H1>
<P>
<I>F.C. Michel Jr., D. Graeber, L.J. Forney and C.A. Reddy</I>
<P>
<I>Biocycle 37(3):64-66. 1996</I>
<P>
This article presents the results of a study that has relevance
to farmers and gardeners wishing to use compost from lawn clippings
that may have been treated with pesticides. According to the article,
over 30,000 tons of pesticides are used each year on lawns, turf
farms, and gardens in the U.S.
<P>
In this study, researchers determined the fate of three lawn care
pesticides during composting. The pesticides tested were the insecticide
diazinon, which is the most widely used lawn care pesticide in
the U.S.; 2,4-D, a postemergence broadleaf herbicide which ranks
second in use; and pendimethalin (also called Prowl&reg;), a preemergence
herbicide commonly used to control broadleaf and grassy weeds.
The experiment was conducted using a laboratory scale compost
system which simulates the temperature and aeration conditions
found in windrows. The sample yard trimmings consisted of leaves
and grass in a 2:1 ratio (wet weight basis). This blend was amended
with radioactive pesticides at 10 ppm, to simulate the levels
of these compounds that might be expected in raw materials used
at composting facilities.
<P>
Each pesticide was tested for three fates. The most desirable
fate for a pesticide during composting is complete mineralization
to carbon dioxide (CO2). Another potential fate is volatilization
into the atmosphere, which may be accelerated by high composting
temperatures. Pesticides could also be leached out during composting
and contaminate groundwater.
<P>
The results showed that 2,4-D was mineralized relatively rapidly
during composting, with nearly half converted to CO2 in 50 days.
Also, the rate of mineralization paralleled the rate of conversion
of total carbon (in the yard trimmings) to CO2. Diazinon and pendimethalin
mineralized much more slowly. Only small fractions of the three
pesticides were volatilized, even though the temperature was maintained
at 55 to 60 C (131 to 140 F) through much of the composting period.
The leachability of each of these pesticides was also low. Finally,
only a small portion of the pesticides remained unchanged in the
final compost: less than 0.01 ppm for 2,4-D, 0.01 ppm for diazinon,
and 0.1 ppm for pendimethalin. 
<P>
This study also evaluated the quantity of pesticide breakdown
products in the compost. Nearly 30 percent of the diazinon originally
present in the feedstock was found to be rapidly converted to
a substance with low toxicity. On the other hand, very small amounts
of breakdown products from pendimethalin and 2,4-D were found.
<P>
Researchers also studied the fate of carbon in the three pesticides
during composting. The results showed that while most of the carbon
was extractable when composting began, about half of the 2,4-D
and diazinon carbon and about three-fourths of the pendimethalin
carbon was found in humic materials or was unextractable from
the final compost. This pesticide carbon was believed to be chemically
different from the parent compound and less bioavailable than
the original pesticide. It was noted, however, that very little
is known about how, and in what form, these &quot;bound&quot;
pesticide residues in compost are released over time.

<P>
This study assessed the composition and abundance of pest and
nonpest arthropods inhabiting conventional and organic rice production
systems in California. The study was conducted in four pairs of
conventional and organic rice fields located in the Sacramento
Valley: three paired sites in 1988 and one paired site in 1989.
Conventional and organic rice fields differed in two key respects:
1) Organic fields were free of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers
during the growing season, and for at least 12 months prior to
rice planting; and 2) Organic fields underwent less intensive
disk plowing and harrowing in preparation for rice planting; this
reduced tillage resulted in greater amounts of coarse plant material
that was not as extensively incorporated into the seedbed. All
fields were subdivided by levees into six or more discrete basins.
Sampling was restricted to three basins within the interior of
each field.  <BR>

<P>
Rice fields were sampled for major arthropod pests at the early
seedling stage, early tillering stage, and just before or during
the reproductive phase. Populations of each pest species were
compared using a paired <I>t </I>test. Additional sampling measured
the relative abundance and activity of other aquatic arthropods
in the rice fields. Populations of non-pest species in each system
were compared using the paired <I>t </I>test, and also by determining
the degree of taxonomic overlap between treatments, termed the
&quot;quotient of similarity,&quot; with values ranging from 0
(no taxa in common) to 1 (all taxa in common).  
<H3>Results </H3>

<P>
The results of this research concur with findings of other studies
comparing arthropod populations in organic and conventional farming
systems. First, although differences in the numbers of pests can
be found, the levels of most species remained below treatment
thresholds in both systems. For the seven major pests in this
study, the differences in abundance or in level of damage between
conventional and organic treatments were not significant (P &gt;
0.05). A summary of the data for two major rice pests is shown
in table 1. Rice water weevil, and aster leaf hopper are the principal
arthropod pests in rice during the early tillering and early reproductive
stages. Pest damage in the seedling stage appeared slightly higher
in organic systems, but this did not affect final plant densities
in the field.  <BR>

Second, populations of the nonpest species were generally higher
in organic fields [notably three predatory taxa-a giant water
bug <I>(Belostoma flumineum), </I>back swimmers <I>(Notonecta
</I>spp.), and an adult predacious diving beetle <I>(Thermonectus
basillaris)]. </I>Where this study differed from previous ones
is that the variety of taxa collected did not differ significantly
between conventional and organic rice fields. The quotient of
similarity between the two treatments was 0.923 indicating that
many of the same species were present in both organic and conventional
systems. Previous studies in other crops showed that organic systems
had greater diversity (Dritschilo and Wanner, 1980; Brown and
Adler, 1989; Goh and Lange, 1989; Kromp, 1989 and 1990).  <BR>

<P>
Some preventive control measures are available for the rice pests
observed in this study. Damage from rice water weevil, for example,
can be reduced by using tolerant varieties, draining fields, disking
grassy levees and other pest habitat, and delaying the time of
planting. Good weed control is an effective means of controlling
aster leafhopper and army-worms. Preventive measures are not always
sufficient, so more research is needed to determine how to control
outbreaks of these key pests in organic systems.  <BR>

The organizers of this four-day symposium had two objectives.
Their first objective was to present the results of a major research
project funded through the USDA-Sustainable Agriculture Research
&amp; Education (SARE) program. This project, <I>Specifying and
Analyzing Whole-Ranch Systems for Sustainable Livestock Production
in Environmentally Sensitive Areas</I>, was conducted on ranches
in the plains and foothill-mountain regions of Montana. The second
was to explore the adequacy of the various criteria being used
to assess the sustainability of range livestock production systems
in the West. To address this second objective, a variety of speakers
was invited to present  perspectives on rangeland sustainability,
including scientists, ranchers, industry representatives, and
representatives from environmental interest groups.
<P>
The proceedings contain abstracts from 20 different presentations
given during the symposium. A wide range of subjects are addressed
in these papers. They are not in-depth analyses, but contact information
is provided for each abstract so that readers can pursue their
areas of interest with the authors if they wish. Major topics
covered in the symposium include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Perspectives on Sustainability
<LI>Economic and Social Issues Affecting Sustainability
<LI>Changing Range Conditions: Impacts on Sustainability
<LI>Managing Rangelands: Strategies for Sustainability
<LI>Effects of Wildlife and Livestock Interactions on Sustainability
<LI>Impacts of Rangeland Management Policy on Sustainability:
Views and Recommendations Regarding the Sustainability of Livestock
on Federal Ranges
</UL>

<P>
In their preface to the proceedings, the symposium organizing
committee concludes that: 1) the research of the Montana-based
SARE project indicates that the majority of ranches monitored
in the study are profitable, financially sustainable, and compatible
with environmental goals; 2) the ongoing research on range livestock
production systems in the West and adjoining regions demonstrates
progress on identifying attributes of sustainable systems; and
3) the debate about the adequacy and appropriateness of the criteria
used to assess the sustainability of rangeland systems needs to
continue.

This article describes a no-tillage vegetable production system
that uses winter annual legumes as both cover crop and plant mulch.
 According to the authors, this production system is adapted to
both large- and small-scale operations. It takes advantage of
the benefits that legumes offer, and avoids the difficulties of
spreading a mulch uniformly over a field.
<P>
The experiment was conducted at the Beltsville, Maryland Research
Center.  The researchers looked at the effects of the no-tillage
system on yield and earliness of fresh market 'Sunny' tomato.
 Tomatoes following cover crops of hairy vetch and 'Mt. Barker'
subterranean clover were compared to those grown under conventional
tillage using black polyethylene mulch, Horto paper mulch, and
no mulch.
<P>
In the cover crop treatments, beds were prepared immediately before
sowing of the cover crops.  Clover seed was planted on September
5 at a rate of 28 kg per ha; vetch seed was planted on September
18 at a rate of 53 kg per ha.  The cover crops were not irrigated
and were grown without any other treatment until they were mowed
the following spring.  In early May, after determinations were
made of cover crop growth, the clover and vetch plots were mowed
to about 4 cm above the soil surface using a high-speed flail
mower.  This operation chopped the plants and spread them uniformly
over the beds.  Five-week-old tomato seedlings were planted through
the mulch layer on May 1 (early planting date) and May 8 (optimum
planting date).  A 7-cm hole was cut through the mulch using a
tree planter and then tomatoes were transplanted by hand causing
minimal disturbance to the mulch.  Trickle irrigation lines were
laid over the cut mulch surface 10 cm away from the plants and
fixed in position with U- shaped wires.  Tomatoes were planted
in the comparative systems on the same two dates (May 1 and 8).
<P>
The poly mulch, paper mulch and bare soil treatments were irrigated
weekly through the drip lines with a 9-6.6-24.9 NPK solution.
 Cover crop/mulch treatments were fertilized every other week
using the same solution.  Weeds were controlled as needed in all
treatments using herbicides.

The effect of the various treatments on tomato yield is shown
in table 1. Total tomato yield in the hairy vetch mulch was more
than double the yield of the control (nonmulched) plants, and
significantly higher for both planting dates than yield from the
black polyethylene-mulched plants.  The authors attributed the
success of the vetch over the clover treatment to its superior
winter hardiness in the Beltsville area.  &quot;The clover stand
was killed on top of beds in winter but produced 3.6 tons per
ha of dry matter in the troughs between rows.  In contrast, the
hairy vetch stand was well established on the beds, and the plants
were about I meter long at mowing time, with 3.8 tons per ha above
ground dry matter.&quot;
<P>
In terms of earliness, black polyethylene mulch was superior to
all other mulches in enhancing yield.  The effects of black polyethylene
mulch in warming soil and promoting plant growth have been well-established.
<P>
The authors suggest that the vetch mulch offers a number of benefits
in this production system.  First, mowing and spreading the cover
crop provides a thick layer of mulch that reduces soil erosion
and soil water evaporation, and that moderates soil temperature.
 The mulch also eliminates early weed competition (later weed
emergence or cover crop regrowth can be controlled with postemergence
herbicides.) The authors also conclude that the cover crop residue
on the soil surface sustains nitrogen decomposition and release
over a longer period than if the cover crop were plowed in.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
The authors have produced a pamphlet for growers that describes
this production system in more detail.  The title is <I>Sustainable
Production of Fresh-Market Tomatoes with Organic Mulches, </I>published
by the United States Department of Agriculture, 1994, Farmers'
Bulletin FB-2279.  Contact Abdul-Baki for information about how
to order the pamphlet (see address below).
<P>
Adapting the no-till mulch production system to California conditions
will require careful management on the part of growers.  Major
considerations include: 1) the choice of cover crop; 2) the effect
of the mulch on soil insect pests; 3) the tendency of the mulch
to keep the soil cool in the spring; 4) the time of mowing as
it relates to conservation of soil water; and 5) the relative
costs and benefits of other types 'of mulches.

<B><DL><DT><A HREF="/cgi-win/ccrop.exe/show_imgs_25">Images of Medics, General</A></B><BR></DL>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The most common types of medic encountered are bur (<I>M. polymorpha</I></B>), barrel (<I>M.  truncatula</I></B>), strand (<I>M. littoralis</I></B>), and snail (<I>M. scutellata</I></B>) (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Miller et al.  (1989) suggested seeding mixtures of medic varieties, in lieu of area-specific information on varietal adaptation.  Medics can be seeded alone or with subterranean and rose clovers, depending on soil and climate (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> Christensen (1971) suggested using winter cover crops in Californian vineyards, with the aim of producing a sod-like condition.  Cover crops would be low growing, require little or no mowing, and be self re-seeding.  Their functions would be to reduce tillage and dust, provide habitat for predators that attack spider mites, improve water penetration, and provide nitrogen.  Annual grasses suggested include barley, 'Blando' brome, or rye. Subterranean clovers recommended include cv 'Geraldton', Dwalganup', 'Howard', and 'Mt. Barker'.  Rose clovers included cv 'Kondinin' and 'Hykon'.  Medics suggested were California bur clover (Burr Medic), 'Cyprus' barrel medic, and ''Harbinger' barrel medic.  Mixtures of subterranean clovers were suggested so that better-adapted varieties will reseed.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seed should be sown using a range or grain drill in stubble or established rangeland, or with a broadcast seeder or drill on prepared seedbeds (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seed are small, so shallow seeding is important: 1/4 inch depth (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>When seeding medics with a drill, 100-150 lbs/acre of 0-25-0 fertilizer should be placed with or near the seed, acccording to Weitkamp and Graves (1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Medics produce high percentages of hard seeds, which remain dormant for one or more years before germinating (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>After a medic stand has produced seed for one year or more, the reserve of hard seed enables the stand to tolerate grazing pressure during flowering or seed maturation and still regenerate the following year (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> In the Palouse region of Washington state, Goldstein and Young (1987) compared conventional winter wheat - spring barley - winter wheat - spring peas rotation to low-input rotation of peas+black medic - medic - wheat rotation.  The latter is termed a "perpetuating-alternative-legume-system" (PALS) because the medic will reseed and reestablish.  Based on results from field trials, PALS generated higher net returns when market prices were used, but the converse was true when government target prices were employed.<P> Crawford and Nankivell (1989) used 3 rotational systems under which they evaluated annual medics: <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa', <I>M scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', and <I>M. truncatula</I></B> cvs 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong'.  <I>Medicago</I></B> spp. re-established better under permanent pasture than under any rotational scheme involving tillage.  Seed preservation, however, was better in rotations involving tillage.  <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa' in rotation trials produced a higher seed yield in the year of sowing than did <I>M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', or <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvv 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong'.  However, its seed bank persisted only 3 years, and its re-establishment was poor, perhaps due to its higher proportion of permeable seed. <I>Medicago truncatula</I></B> cv 'Jemalong' maintained higher seed reserves after six years of cropping than <I> M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Cyprus' or <I>M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson'.  Seed banks of all species were exhausted after 7 years.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Newer medic cultivars show improved resistance to the weevil Egyptian alfalfa weevil.  Tolerances are as follows:<P>
<PRE>
 Barrel Medic:<P>
      Good tolerance - Sephi
      Fair tolerance - Jemalong, Ghor, Ascot, Paraggio
      Poor tolerance - Hannaford, Cyprus, Cyfield, Borung, Akbar
      Strand Medic:
      Poor tolerance - Harbinger
 Gama Medics (<I>M.  rugosa</I></B>):

 Snail Medic (<I>M.  scutellata</I></B>):
      Fair tolerance - Sava
      Poor tolerance - Robinson, Sair (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988)
</PRE>

 In an unreplicated observation, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) (tarnished plant bug) attained extremely-high densities on <I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> ssp.  <I>subspina</I></B> cv 'Circle Valley', placing it well above the 95% confidence interval for densities observed on 11 varieties of subterranean clover (Bugg et al., 1990).  Subsequent observations in northern California suggest that <I>Lygus</I></B> is abundant on bur and barrel medics in California as well (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Medics will persist over a wide range of rainfall and soil conditions and are considered best for planting where rainfall is less than 15 inches annually and the growing season short; most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  (true clovers) will not survive such conditions (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Medics are for the most part restricted to Mediterranean climates with winter rain and long, hot, dry, summers.  Unlike some clovers, most medics do not tolerate waterlogged soils, perhaps in part explaining their greater abundance in the drier, more inland regions.  In areas of high rainfall, vigorous stands are found only on well-drained sites.  Hard seeds enable medics to survive dry seasons (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>The species and cultivars vary in length of time to flowering. Approximate dates when flowering begins were given by Quinlivan et al.  for Merredin, Australia (Southern Hemisphere), with dates for the Northern Hemisphere projected by the editor (R.L.  Bugg):<P> Ghor barrel medic - 1st week of August (early March in Northern Hemisphere)<P> Cyprus barrel medic - 2nd to 3rd week of August (mid- to late- March in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Harbinger strand medic - 3rd week of August (late March in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Goldfields medic - 3rd week of August (late March in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Burr medic - 3rd week of August (late March in Northern Hemisphere)<P> Dwalganup subterranean clover - 3rd week of August (late March in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Hannaford barrel medic - 1st week of Sept.  (Early April in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Cyfield barrel medic - 1st week of Sept.  (early April in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Tornafield disc medic - 1st week of Sept.  (early April in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Murrayland disc medic - 1st to 2nd week of Sept.  (early to mid April in Northern Hemisphere).<P> Jemalong barrel medic - 2nd week of Sept.  (mid-April in Northern Hemisphere).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Medics are typically deeper rooted and more drought tolerant than are subclovers (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>The oestrogenic potency of medics is low.  However, the leaves and pods of several cultivars of barrel medic (i.e., 'Cyprus,' 'Jemalong,' and 'Hannaford') sometimes contain substantial amounts of coumestan (especially 4 methoxy coumestrol).  The possibility of adverse effects on ewe performance especially on dry pastures needs to be kept in mind.  Other cultivars and species (e.g.  Tornafield and Paragosa medic) have low coumestan contents (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>In Australia, medic pastures can sustain severe damage by red legged earth mite (<I>Halotydeus destructor</I></B>) and lucerne flea (<I>Sminthuris viridus</I></B>), especially early in the season.  In south Australia, sitona weevil (<I>Sitona humeralis</I></B>) is abundant and damaging.  Adults feed on foliage, whereas larvae attack nodules of all species.  This weevil does not occur in Western Australia (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>'Harbinger' strand medic matures about the same time as 'Cyprus' barrel medic (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Per the account by Quinlivan et al.  (no date), the medics can differ from the clovers (<I>Trifolium</I></B> species) in having yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves in which the central leaflet has a longer stalk than the two lateral leaflets.  Hop and suckling clovers have yellow flowers, and leaves like medics, but most clovers have white, pink or purple flowers and the leaflets have stalks of equal length.  The fruits of medics are distinct from those of all clovers.  In medics, the flower petals drop off and a spirally coiled pod forms, whereas in the clovers the dry petals often remain on the fruit, the pod is straight or globular and frequently very short and enclosed in the calyx.  Medic cotyledons have a blade which gradually narrows into the stalk; in clovers, the blade of the cotyledon has an abrupt articulation or hinge with its stalk.  All <I>Medicago</I></B> spp.  have a disinctive tripping mechanism of the flower.  In the freshly opened flower, the ovary and anthers are flung out of the keel and over onto the standard petal.  This must occur to allow fertilization and subsequent fruit development.<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>For Californian vineyards, French plowing would leave a narrow strip of cover crops in each alley and would permit use of early-maturing species like bur clover.  Dates for plowing down cover crops depend on the maturation dates; for medics, the date should be in mid-May (Christensen, 1971).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Habben and Blevins (1989) showed in laboratory studies using double-tube apparatus that transfer of rubidium-86 (potassium) occurred from deeply-rooted alfalfa (<I>Medicago sativa</I></B> L.) to associated, shallow rooted maize (<I>Zea mays</I></B> L.) or grain sorghum (<I>Sorghum vulgare</I></B> Pers.).  This may explain previous observations of higher concentrations of potassium and other cationic nutrients for grasses grown in association with legumes than for grasses grown alone.  Legumes are typically deeper rooted than the associated grasses and may access deeper sources of nutrients.  Possible mechanisms for the transfer are root-to-root contact, transfer via the soil solution, or transfer by mycorrhizal connections.  None of these processes were actually demonstrated in this study.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Towshend and Davidson (198?) evaluated thirty-five wild and cultivated grasses and 4 forage legumes in small plots.  Of the legumes, alfalfa was among the poorest hosts for pin nematode (<I>Paratylenchus projectus</I></B>).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Medics grow best in cool, fall temperatures (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Estimated biomass production by barrel medic was 7.78 +/- 0.79 Mg/ha and by bur medic, 8.35 +/- 1.84 Mg/ha (mean +/- S.E.M.), based on a study in an organic wine vineyard in Hopland, Mendocino County, California (Bugg, unpulbished data).<P> <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B> (bur medic) yields 5,000-7,500 kg/ha of hay (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Munoz and Graves (1988) estimated that, as an orchard or vineyard cover crop, medics could contain 50-100 lb N/a, and 50-200 lb/a as living mulch for vegetable or field crops.<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Medicago spp.</I></B> (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P> The genus <I>Medicago</I></B> includes <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> (barrel medic), <I>M.  littoralis</I></B> (strand medic) <I>M.  rugosa</I></B> (Gama medic), <I>M.  tornata</I></B>(disc medic), <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B> (bur medic), and <I>M.  scutellata</I></B> (snail medic) (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Suggested seeding rates include 10 lb/acre (Miller, 1988; Hofstetter, 1988) and 15-30 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> To reduce economic risk, 2-6 lbs/acre of a mixture of medic varieties has also been recommended.  If clovers and/or grasses are included, the rate may total 6 to 12 lbs/acre (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Medics can be used as green manure (Hofstetter, 1988), orchard cover crops (Miller, 1988), forage (Munoz & Graves, 1988), hay, or compost (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> As observed by Glatzle (1989), ley-farming (cereal grain production alternating with pasture) with annual, self-regenerating legumes is increasingly used in areas with Mediterranean climate. In particular, practices in southern and southwestern Australia involve the use of self-regenerating stands of annual medics (<I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B>, <I>M.  truncatula</I></B>, <I>M. littoralis</I></B>, <I>M tornata</I></B>, <I>M  scutellata</I></B>, and <I>M. rugosa</I></B>) and subterranean clovers (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L., ssp. <I>subterraneum, brachycalycinum</I></B>, and <I>yanninicum</I></B>).  Advantages include production of high-quality forage, need to sow pasture but once, increased yield of cereal in response to nitrogen added by pasture legumes, soil protection and improvement, and stabilization of farmers' incomes.<P> Medics are well suited for close rotations such as annual legume (livestock) - cereal rotation (ley farming system) (Miller et al., 1989), as is practiced in Australia and Northern Africa (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P> Seed pods make excellent high-protein dry feed (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Autumn seeding is generally recommended (Miller, 1988; Munoz & Graves, 1988), generally before the first rains (Miller et al. 1989).  Weitkamp and Graves (1988) suggested October.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Growth habits of cool-season annual medics are variable; as given by Duke (1981): <I>Medicago arabica</I></B> (southern or spotted burclover): branched at crown, spreading or decumbent; <I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> (black medic or yellow trefoil): prostrate or ascending; <I>Medicago orbicularis</I></B> (buttonclover or large disc-medic): procumbent, decumbent, or ascending.  <I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> (California or toothed burclover): semierect or prostrate; <I>Medicago scutellata</I></B> (snail medic): stems long, slender, and weak.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Medics do well on sandy to clayey soils, according to Munoz & Graves (1988).  Annual medics, <I>Medicago</I></B> spp., are best suited for alkaline soils, with the exceptions of <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B> and <I>M. murex</I></B>, which tolerate acid soils (Reed et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Annual medics, <I>Medicago</I></B> spp., are best suited for alkaline soils, with the exceptions of <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B> and <I>M. murex</I></B>, which tolerate acid soils (Reed et al., 1989).  Medics grow best on neutral to alkaline soil (Miller, 1988), and some workers have stated that only basic soils will do (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Hofstetter (1988) gave the suitable pH range as 6.5 to 7.0. However, Miller et al. (1989) said that the genus performs best with pH above 7 but will adapt to neutral soil types.<P> The symbiotic rhizobia of medics tolerate acid soils less well than do those of clovers.  This may be a factor limiting medics to soils with an alkaline-neutral in the profile.  Sometimes these soil types are slightly acid in the top few cm., but at lower levels in the main medic root zone they may be neutral and become increasingly alkaline with depth.  The acid intolerance of medics may also result from mineral deficiencies or toxicities.  Medics have an unusually high Ca requirement compared to most other legumes, and this nutrient is often unavailable in acid soils. Medics are less tolerant than other legumes (including suclover) of high Al concentrations (Quinlivan et al.).<P> According to Howieson and Ewing (1989), annual species of <I>Medicago</I></B> differ greatly in their ability to nodulate on acid soils.  Failure to nodulate in the second year following sowing is the most important barrier to the wider use of reseeding medics on acid soils.  <I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> L. and <I>M.  murex</I></B> Willd.  have proven more successful in nodulating on nutrient-poor, acid soils that have <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> Gaertn., <I>M. littoralis</I></B> Rohde, and <I>M.  tornata</I></B> (L.) Mill., which are more widely commercialized.  At low densities of rhizobial inoculum in acid soil (pH 4.9), evaluation of percentages of nodulated plants yielded the following gradient: <I>M.  murex</I></B> > <I>M. soleirolii</I></B> > <I>M. polymorpha</I></B> > <I>M. aculeata</I></B> > <I>M. littoralis/truncatula</I></B> > <I>M. tornata</I></B> > <I>M.  praecox</I></B> > <I>M.  rugosa</I></B> > <I>M.  arabica</I></B> > <I>M.  shepardii</I></B> > <I>M. orbicularis</I></B> > <I>M.  minima</I></B> > <I>M.  rotata</I></B>.  Not all of these differences were statistically significant.  <I>Medicago murex</I></B> was significantly better than all other groups (Howieson and Ewing, 1989).<P> <I>Medicago murex</I></B>, <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B>, and <I>M. soleirolii</I></B> are particularly good at nodulating on acid soils, when acid-tolerant rhizobia are used (<I>Rhizobia meliloti</I></B> strain WSM419).  <I>M.  tornata</I></B>, <I>M.  truncatula</I></B>, and <I>M. littoralis</I></B> did not perform so well (Howieson and Ewing, 1989).<P> The new acid-tolerant rhizobial strains may render previously inhospitable low-pH sites suitable to medics (Graves, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Annual (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Medics behave as winter annuals (Miller, 1988) but have also been termed winter-spring annual (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Germination occurs with autumn rains, and the stand develops during winter and early spring (Quinlivan et al.).<P> For various medics, up to 95% of fully-opened flowers abort, failing to produce mature pods.  By contrast, for subterranean clover, the range is from 23-63%.  Abortion may be a means of ensuring that the seed that form are sufficiently large to produce viable seedlings (Cocks, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Medic seed costs about $1.25/lb (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>The irrigation requirement for medics is 12", less any rainfall (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Medics resemble the annual clovers in that they are adapted to a Mediterranean climate with 250 to 500 mm of predominantly winter rainfall (Quinlivan et al.).  However, medics do not tolerate waterlogging and, in areas with high rainfall, vigorous stands are found only where drainage is good (Quinlivan et al.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Medics are good at self-seeding (Munoz & Graves, 1988; Miller, 1988).<P> All medics produce hard seed.  Most seed become hard and remain so through to the following autumn or beyond.  Where medic pastures are used in rotation with field crops, hard seededness is an asset. The disadvantage is that second year pasture can be thin, because most seed does not germinate.  By the third and fourth years, medic stands tend to improve, if competition from other species is not excessive (Quinlivan et al.).<P> Annual medics, <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa', <I>M scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', and <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvs 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong' were evaluated in 3 rotational systems. <I>Medicago</I></B> spp. re-established better under permanent pasture than under any rotational scheme involving tillage.  Seed preservation, however, was better in rotations involving tillage. <I>Medicago rugosa</I></B> cv 'Paragosa' in rotation trials produced a higher seed yield in the year of sowing than did <I>M. scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson', or <I>M.  truncatula</I></B> cvv 'Cyprus' and 'Jemalong'.  However, its seed bank persisted only 3 years, and its re-establishment was poor, perhaps due to its higher proportion of permeable seed.  <I>Medicago truncatula</I></B> cv 'Jemalong' maintained higher seed reserves after six years of cropping than <I> M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Cyprus' or <I>M.  scutellata</I></B> cv 'Robinson'.  Seed banks of all species were exhausted after 7 years (Crawford and Nankivell, 1989).<P> For various medics, up to 95% of fully-opened flowers abort, failing to produce mature pods.  By contrast, for subterranean clover, the range is from 23-63%.  Abortion may be a means of ensuring that seed are sufficiently large to produce viable seedlings (Cocks, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Medics tolerate mowing or grazing well (Munoz & Graves, 1988) and should be mowed frequently to height of 3-5 inches during their growing season to improve competitiveness against weeds and seed set (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Medics should be grazed from February to the beginning of flowering, then rested through seed maturation.  Thereafter, grazing can resume through the summer and up to the time of cereal planting (in ley rotation system).  Grazing stimulates flowering and seed production (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Grazing reduces competition from grasses and other plants.  Stock moderately to heavily during the winter and early spring growth periods, then rest to allow flowering and seed maturation (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>For cool-season annual medics, inoculation type is Medic Special (Nitragin Co. inoculant types) (Munoz & Graves, 1988); this is also known as Special Culture No. 1 for <I>Medicago</I></B> (Duke, 1981). Medics usually nodulate and fix nitrogen when inoculated with the standard Australian commercial medic inoculant (rhizobial strains SU47 and U45) (Quinlivan et al.).<P> Acid-tolerant rhizobial strains may inable cool-season medics to grow on sites that were formerly inhospitable (W. Graves, pers. comm.).  <I>Medicago murex</I></B>, <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B>, and <I>M. soleirolii</I></B> are particularly good at nodulating on acid soils, when acid-tolerant rhizobia are used (<I>Rhizobia meliloti</I></B> strain WSM419).  <I>M.  tornata</I></B>, <I>M.  truncatula</I></B>, and <I>M. littoralis</I></B> did not perform so well.  At low densities of rhizobial inoculum in acid soil (pH 4.9), evaluation of percentages of nodulated plants yielded the following gradient: <I>M. murex</I></B> > <I>M.  soleirolii</I></B> > <I>M.  polymorpha</I></B> > <I>M.  aculeata</I></B> > <I>M.  littoralis/truncatula</I></B> > <I>M.  tornata</I></B> > <I>M. praecox</I></B> > <I>M.  rugosa</I></B> > <I>M.  arabica</I></B> > <I>M. shepardii</I></B> > <I>M.  orbicularis</I></B> > <I>M.  minima</I></B> > <I>M. rotata</I></B>.  Not all of these differences were statistically significant. <I>Medicago murex</I></B> was significantly better than all other groups (Howieson and Ewing, 1989).<P> Proper inoculation just before seeding is important.  The Pellinoc-Pelgel method of inoculation, which can be applied to the seed by the rancher, has given good results more consistently than pelleting methods applied by seed companies (Weitkamp and Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>

<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Medics show a tolerance to low doses of 2-4,D-amine and a resistance to 2-4,DB.  They also will show tolerance to light doses of glyphosate.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Medic seed is readily available in most parts of the U.S., especially California, to satisfy the needs of the dryland range pastures in high-pH soils.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Most medics have a high hard seed content of 30-45% the first year.  Seed germination declines slowly and may still be 50% viable after 10 years.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>While generally viny and prostrate as a class, the 'Sava' snail medic when grown with barley can be as tall as the barley heads, or 30-36 inches.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>The seed should be planted one-half-inch deep.  Seedlings will respond to phosphate and sulphur fertilizer as a starter.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>

<P>
Because cover crops contribute to soil fertility and offer possible
pest management benefits, farmers in the Salinas Valley have recently
shown renewed interest in alternative cover crops for both conventional
and organic vegetable production and have begun considering newly
utilized cover crop species such as phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia)
and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus). 
<P>
However, the impact of phacelia, oil seed radish, and other cover
crops on populations of Sclerotinia minor, the causal agent of
the disease lettuce drop, is not known. Because of the extensive
lettuce industry in the Salinas Valley, information was needed
on the interaction of new cover crop introductions and S. minor.
The purpose of this study was to test cover crop species for susceptibility
to S. minor and to <BR>
assess the effect of cover crop plantings on lettuce drop incidence
in field situations.
<H3>Procedures</H3>
<P>
Our two-year field study and greenhouse inoculation experiments
identified three cover crops as new hosts of S. minor. Pathogenicity
was established by planting four-week-old transplants of six cover
crops and lettuce into sand amended with sclerotia (35 sclerotia/100-cm3
sand). After four weeks incubation in a greenhouse, phacelia,
Lana woollypod vetch (Vicia dasycarpa), and Austrian winter pea
(Pisum sativum L. ssp. arvense) became infected in addition to
lettuce. S. minor was reisolated from the diseased cover crop
plants. To assess susceptibility in a field situation, seven cover
crop species, lettuce, and fallow control treatments were planted
for two consecutive years into randomized, replicated field plots
infested with sclerotia.
<H3>Results</H3>
<P>
In both 1993 and 1994 experiments (see Table 1), phacelia, Lana
woollypod vetch, purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis), Austrian winter
pea, and lettuce became infected and the pathogen was isolated
from field samples. Numbers of sclerotia in soil samples from
cover crop plots were not significantly higher than those from
fallow plots. When lettuce was planted after cover crop incorporation,
phacelia, Lana woollypod vetch, and Austrian winter pea plots
had significantly higher lettuce drop incidence than fallow plots
in the first year. In the second year, only phacelia plots had
significantly more lettuce drop. This is the first report of S.
minor as a pathogen of phacelia, Lana woollypod vetch, and Austrian
winter pea cover crops in California.
<P>
Conversely, greenhouse and field inoculations failed to result
in S. minor infections of oilseed radish, barley, and favabean
cover crops. For both 1993 and 1994 field experiments, lettuce
drop incidence in these three cover crop treatments was not significantly
different than that for fallow treatment plots.

<P>
The use of mulches may be beneficial for citrus and avocado crops,
since they are very shallow-rooted. Some mulches have been shown
to reduce Phytophthora root rots through one or more of several
mechanisms. This multidisciplinary project, conducted at UC Riverside,
examined the use of various organic materials as mulches on young
citrus and avocado trees. The goal of the research was to determine
the effects of these materials on plant growth and health and
their ability to support the growth of microbial biocontrol agents.
The researchers also correlated biological parameters with chemical
composition of the mulches to determine which mulch characteristics
support growth of the trees and of microbial biocontrol agents.
Field experiments are also underway to complement this greenhouse
work.
<H3>Materials and Methods</H3>

<P>
Eighteen mulching materials were used in the experiment, some
of which were composted. Mulches were applied to 'Topa Topa' avocado
and 'Troyer' citrange seedlings recently transplanted to pots
in a greenhouse (500 ml of mulch per 3-liter pot). Five replicate
plants each were used, and the experiments were terminated after
three months. Analyses were made of numerous characteristics of
the mulch materials, growth of three microbial antagonists of
pathogens, and various plant responses.
<H3>Results </H3>

<P>
The greatest amounts of ammonia were released from grass clippings,
milled almond and peanut hulls, and alfalfa hay (Table 1). None
of the mulches significantly increased shoot growth of citrange
seedlings compared to the control. In contrast, avocado shoot
growth significantly increased with mulches of yard waste, grass
clippings, and earthworm-composted sludge. Almond and peanut hulls
were clearly detrimental to the roots of both citrange and avocado
roots and to the shoot growth of avocado. The microbial biocontrol
agents as a group grew best in yard waste, sudangrass hay, wood
compost, rice hulls and rice hulls/paper. Of these, only yard
waste, rice hulls, and rice hulls/paper were completely acceptable
as mulches for avocado and citrus.
<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>
Citrus and avocado are well suited to benefit from mulches. They
have very shallow root systems, with the far majority of their
roots located in the top 1 to 2 feet of soil. Avocado roots will
often grow up directly into a mulch layer; this fact led the researchers
to believe that avocado responds more positively to mulching than
does citrus.
<P>
Among the mulches examined, the structure and chemical composition
of yard waste most closely resembles a forest litter layer similar
to that in which citrus and avocado evolved. According to the
authors, the beneficial effects of yard wastes can be explained
by the high-nitrogen grass that offset the high carbon-to-nitrogen
composition of wood chips and greatly reduced any temporary nitrogen
shortage.
<P>
The authors believe that citrus responded better with higher nitrogen
and lower carbon mulches than did avocado because citrus responds
to nitrogen deficiencies far more rapidly than does avocado. Some
of the mulches, such as almond and peanut hulls, several manures,
and alfalfa hay, had negative effects in this experiment: They
reduced shoot and/or root growth, released large amounts of ammonia
upon degradation, and resulted in undetectable populations of
at least two of the three biocontrol agents tested.
<P>
Animal manures are among the most common amendments applied to
citrus and avocado orchards. The authors noted that root damage
after application of high ammonia-releasing manures is common,
especially to young trees. (Well-composted animal manures which
do not release ammonia are believed by the authors to be acceptable
for use on citrus.) Young trees are also more sensitive to Phytophthora
infection. The authors believe that young trees are more susceptible
to damage due to the higher foliage-to-root ratio of young compared
to older trees; also, older trees may not show damage from the
use of manures even though some root loss occurs. They also caution
against extrapolating the results of these greenhouse experiments
to effects of mulching in the field.
<P>
The successful growth of the three microbial biocontrol agents
on several mulching materials was promising. Strains of the three
species tested, the common soil bacterium, <I>Pseudomonas fluorescens</I>
and the ubiquitous soil fungi, <I>Gliocladium virens</I> and <I>Trichoderma
harzianum</I>, have showed potential for suppressing Phytophthora
root rots of avocado and citrus in previous greehnouse experiments.
<P>
The results of this research demonstrate several important points,
including: 1) the excellent potential for some mulching materials,
such as yard waste, for improving growth of trees; 2) mulches
most beneficial to citrus and avocado roots are also efficient
substrates for some biocontrol agents; and 3) a huge urban problem
can be at least partially solved by diverting part of the waste
stream to citrus and avocado orchards.

<H1>Farm Borrowers: What Is Your Environmental Liability?<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>The following article by </I><B>Karen
Klonsky</B>, <I>farm management specialist, and </I><B>Kim Norris</B>,
<I>research manager, both of the Department of Agricultural Economics,
UC Davis, is based on information presented at a toxics liability
symposium July 26, 1990 in Fresno sponsored by UC Cooperative
Extension and the UC Agricultural Issues Center.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Farm operations, like any businesses using hazardous or toxic
materials, run the risk of incurring liability for clean-up of
their own or neighboring properties contaminated by the storage,
use, or disposal of those materials. The owner of property that
has been contaminated by a tenant or previous owner can be liable
for clean-up. This includes banks that have taken ownership of
property in foreclosure. Any person or business entity that can
be shown to have influence over the management of the business
can be liable, again implicating agricultural lenders.<BR>
<P>
These new risks - a result of federal Superfund legislation -
mean that most lenders now want to assess the environmental condition
of the property being farmed before making a production or real
estate loan. In turn, farmers applying for production or real
estate loans should be prepared to answer detailed questions about
the history of the farm. For example, borrowers may be asked if
the property ever contained any surface or underground storage
tanks, or if there are any records of chemical or waste spills.
<BR>
<P>
This is new territory for ag lenders and borrowers alike. It is
only in the past few years that farm property environmental questionnaires
and site assessments have joined balance sheets and income statements
as part of farm loan requirements. Many growers want to know how
it will affect their access to credit.
<H3>Superfund Link</H3>
<P>
The main impetus for change has been the enforcement of federal
Superfund legislation. <I>Superfund </I>is the term commonly used
to refer to the Comprehensive Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and its 1986 extension, the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act (SARA). While a number of federal and
state environmental laws affect agriculture (FIFRA, RCRA, Proposition
65), Superfund has had the greatest impact on farm lending practices.
<BR>
<P>
Under Superfund, there are four categories of &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; who may be held accountable for the
clean-up of contaminated property. To date, four court cases have
upheld lender liability in two of these categories. First, if
a bank takes ownership of contaminated property through foreclosure,
the bank as owner is liable for clean-up, even if it did not hold
the property at the time the contamination occurred. Second, even
where land is not held as collateral, a lender may be held liable
for clean-up costs if it was involved in the daily operations
of the business. A very recent district court decision held that
a lender is liable for clean-up costs if it has the &quot;potential
to influence&quot; production decisions that led to the contamination.
Often, a bank making a production loan will make periodic site
visits and be aware of the production plans of the farm operation.
This can be construed as having &quot;potential to influence&quot;
business decisions.<BR>
<P>
In this environment the lender faces three kinds of risk, known
as the three C's: credit, collateral and clean-up. Credit risk
is the risk that the borrower may become financially unable to
service its debt if hazardous waste clean-up is required. Collateral
risk is the risk that the value of property securing the loan
will be impaired if environmental contamination is discovered
on that property or adjoining property. Clean-up risk is the risk
that the lender will be held liable for part or all of the cost
of cleaning-up a contaminated property, whether or not that lender
was responsible for the mess. It is also possible that the cost
of a hazardous waste clean-up may exceed the value of the property.
To protect themselves from these risks and liabilities, lenders
increasingly  are  using  farm property  environmental questionnaires
and environmental site assessments to determine the likelihood
of environmental hazards.
<H3>Assessing Risk</H3>
<P>
Banks generally use two methods to assess environmental risk.
The first is an environmental questionnaire. These questionnaires
are used to collect information about past uses of the property,
the presence of underground storage tanks, sumps, holding ponds,
storage facilities for toxic substances, and cleanup and disposal
practices. Answers to the questions may flag the need for an environmental
site assessment (ESA).<BR>
<P>
An environmental site assessment is a study of the nature and
extent of toxic conditions conducted by a qualified third party.
An ESA consists of three phases. The first phase usually includes
site inspection, public agency file review, review of site history,
regulatory compliance investigation, and aerial photo review.
The public agencies that may be asked for information are the
environmental health division of the county health services agency,
the appropriate regional office of the California Department of
Health Services, Toxic Substances Control Division and the appropriate
Regional Water Quality Control Board. Other sources of information
include the county agricultural commissioner's office, local planning
and building departments, and the county assessor's office and
records office. The results of the Phase 1 inspection will determine
whether or not Phase 2 is necessary.<BR>
<P>
A Phase 2 ESA includes 1) checking for PCB in transformers and
asbestos in buildings; 2) sub-surface testing for toxic substances;
3) testing of surface water, runoff and sub-surface water; and
4) a plan for clean-up if necessary. The final phase is the clean-up
itself. Usually the environmental consultant who conducted the
ESA will also carry out the cleanup. Clean-up may entail the disposal
of empty containers or the removal of contaminated soil. These
activities can only be carried out by licensed businesses, and
brought to licensed waste disposal sites.
<H3>Borrower Implications</H3>
<P>
Bankers do not use a standard set of guidelines in deciding whether
or not to require an environmental questionnaire or site assessment.
Each bank has to develop its own environmental risk policy. These
additional requirements for a loan add to the cost of doing business.
While there are no industry-wide numbers to report, numerous agricultural
lenders have assumed
<P>
responsibility for hazardous waste clean-up on foreclosed properties.
 For example, Farmers Home Administration in California has spent
$13 million since December 1987 to clean up 17 contaminated properties.
<BR>
<P>
It is not clear to what extent these costs are being passed on
to borrowers in today's competitive loan market.  It is clear
that banks do not want the requirements for questionnaires or
ESAs to be a competitive tool.  However, large and small farm
lenders are using farm  property environmental questionnaires
and site assessments to reduce the risk of potential liability.
In so doing, they are in the position of policing agriculture
and influencing on-farm toxic management systems.
<H3>Scrutinize Real Estate</H3>
<P>
Anyone involved in a real estate transaction or long-term agricultural
lease should determine the environmental condition of the property
involved. If you are selling land you will want a clean bill of
health going into any sales negotiations so that environmental
condition of the property does not become a sticky bargaining
point. Also, if there is a contamination problem on the property
in the future, you will want to be able to prove that the property
was clean when you sold it. If you are buying property, you should
find out about any potential problems before you take ownership.
If there is a problem, clean-up costs can be built into the sales
agreement. The same logic applies to entry into a long-term agricultural
lease.<BR>

<BR>
During the past two years we have been working in four peach orchards
owned by two large farming operations, assisting them in the transition
from conventional to reduced chemical (RC) management systems.
In each orchard, half of the block has been left under conventional
management for comparison. Initially, we concentrated on insect
pest management since several &quot;sustainable&quot; tools are
available. <BR>
<BR>
These tools, which replace broad spectrum pesticides, include
oil sprays in the dormant season, a very specific insect bacteria
spray (<I>Bacillus thuringiensis</I>) and mating disruption using
pheromone confusion. We are also slowly bringing down the nitrogen
level in the trees to help in insect and disease management and
using composts, manures and/or cover crops to supply nitrogen
where feasible. The results from 1993 demonstrated insect control
in all four RC block to be as good or better than conventional
blocks. There were some minor problems in one of the RC orchards
with secondary insect pests. <BR>
<BR>
Good progress was made toward a more sustainable approach to brown
rot (the major fruit disease of peach) management. Three tools
have shown promise: maintenance of moderately low tree nitrogen
level, addition of organic composts to the soil and cleaning up
of diseased, mummified fruits in the trees. In addition to less
fruit disease, the application of compost to the soil has also
shown a tendency toward better fruit quality and less fruit damage
from insects. <BR>
<BR>
Many side studies are being conducted to develop additional RC
tools. These include cover crops for weed control on the berms,
cover crops for nematode control and pheromone confusion for mating
disruption of some secondary pests. Also, a new planting was established
on University property where numerous RC techniques will be evaluated
and demonstrated to large numbers of visitors.<BR>

<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Hermann (1960) described woollypod vetch as being very similar to hairy vetch (<I> V.  villosa </I></B>) but differing in its appressed-pubescent or glabrate stem and foliage, in its fewer (usually only 5 to 15)-flowered racemes not plumose in bud, and in its shorter (1 to 2 mm. long), glabrescent lower calyx-teeth. Distinction is sometimes made between the woollypod vetch (<I> V. dasycarpa </I></B>) and the "smooth hairy" vetch (<I>V.  dasycarpa</I></B> var. <I>glabrescens</I></B>), a race that was formerly considered a variant of the hairy vetch (<I>V.  villosa</I></B>).  In the typical from of the woollypod vetch, the leaflets tend to be obtuse and as much as 4 to 6 mm. wide, the racemes mostly only 6- to 12- flowered and longer than the leaves, the flowers usually less than 15 mm. long, the pods about 40 by 10 mm., often finely hairy.  In the smooth vetch, the leaflets are commonly acute and only about 2 to 4 mm. wide, the racemes generally many-flowered and hardly longer than the leaves, the flowers about 15 to 17 mm. long, the longest pods about 9 mm. wide.  The two races are connected by numerous intermediate forms, however, so that their separation is often impracticable.<P> Williams et al. (1959) stated that woollypod vetch is similar in general appearance to hairy vetch; however, the flowers are a little smaller.  Woollypod vetch is self-fertile, although very attractive to bees.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds subglobose to oval-oblong, 4 to 5 mm. in diameter, dull blackish brown to velvety black, sometimes obscurely mottled, the hilum encircling about 1/7 of the seed (Hermann, 1960).<P> Woollypod vetch produces a moderate proportion of hard seed.  The seeds are more oval than are the nearly round seeds of hairy vetch (Williams et al., 1959).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Corn grown following incorporation of cv 'Lana' woollypod vetch showed a yield response equivalent to 200 lbs/acre of fertilizer N in recent experiment at Davis (Miller et al., 1989) and produced yields of 250 lbs/acre nitrogen when harvested at maximum growth at Davis (Miller et al., 1989).  Other estimates for 'Lana' include 50-100 lb N/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 50-200 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and 300 lb of nitrogen per acre by the end of April under favorable conditions when planted in October (Miller, 1988).<P> At plowdown, of cv 'Lana,' available N (in lbs of N/acre) can be estimated by multiplying harvested fresh weight of cover crop from a sixteen square feet (4 x 4 ft.) sample plot by 18 (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is the earliest-maturing species of commercially available vetches, blooming about three weeks earlier than purple vetch (Williams et al., 1959).  Miller et al., (1989) echoed this, writing that Cv 'Lana' flowers about three weeks earlier than purple vetch and can, therefore, set seed in dryland conditions that would be unfavorable to other vetch species.  In Yolo County, California, fall-seeded woollypod vetch is in full flower by mid-April (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>In a replicated study (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991, cv 'Lana' attained a height of 67.31+/-4.21 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.). This contrasted to 54.61 +/- 3.02 for common vetch and 57.15 +/- 4.46 cm for purple vetch but was not deemed significantly different from these values in the overall assessment of 30 cover crops (Fisher's protected least significant difference = 16.694) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Cv 'Lana' can become 24 inches tall in a dense stand (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986) or 30 inches without support (Slayback, pers. comm.), but when used as a covercrop, it seldom attains its maximum height before being plowed under (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Finch and Sharp (1983) stated that cv 'Lana' is well suited where mowing is infrequent.  Infrequent clipping can occur up to about March 25.  The stand should then be allowed to mature until about May 25.  It can be mowed during the growing season with the mower height at ca 5 inches.  In lieu of mowing, height can be controlled by running a roller or similar implement over the stand.<P> Miller et al.  (1989) cautioned that cv 'Lana' is not tolerant of frequent mowing and can only be mowed down to a height of five inches.  Where frequent, close mowing of the covercrop is needed to reduce the threat of frost, 'Lana' vetch will not reseed.<P> Cv 'Lana' can be mowed after seed production, if reseeding is desired (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Cv 'Lana' used as a living mulch should be mowed at the time of planting the vegetable (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Weedy fields of a high 'Lana' vetch can be mowed or grazed very close to the ground for weed control.  The vetch will recover and may be quite competitive with remaining weeds.  (Mark van Horn, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>In vineyards, cv 'Lana' vetch can present a maintenance problem by aggressively climbing trellises (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Cv 'Lana' reseeds well (Finch and Sharp, 1983), but under no-till management in an organic vineyard in Mendocino County, California, Bugg et al. (unpublished data) found little 2nd-year regeneration after a heavy seed crop the first year.  This may relate to hardseededness of the species.<P> In his organic walnut orchards, Russell Lester of Solano County California (near Winters, Yolo County) is experimenting (1990-1992) with strip management of 'Lana' vetch and other cover crops.  In theory, 10% of the orchard floor devoted to a reseeding remnant strip could more than suffice for reseeding the entire floor to cv 'Lana.' Lester uses flail chopping in late April over most understory vegetation.  Remnant strips may have to be shifted from year to year to distribute the seed bank (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>'Lana' has strong seedling vigor (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' seed is widely available (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch has a taproot-dominated root system (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Mature residue of cv 'Lana' breaks down rapidly (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>It is palatable to livestock when green but, like most vetches, is more so when dry (Williams et al., 1959).  Livestock will avoid it when green as it is "bitter" but will readily eat it dry.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P> To ensure high protein feed in summer and early fall, postpone grazing of 'Lana' until after the growing season (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is easy to establish (Williams et al., 1959; Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> Williams et al.  (1959) recommended that on rangelands where there is competition from annual grasses or sprouting brush, newly planted woollypod vetch stands should be grazed as soon as competitors are of pasturable height. Grazing should be to a uniform height of about 3 inches and should last no more than 1 month.  Avoid grazing while the soil is saturated, or trampling damage may occur.  Remove stock well before spring moisture depletion to allow the vetch to regrow and mature a seed crop.  A weed-free brush burn planting becomes better established if stock are kept off the first season until seed is ripe.<P> In a Pennsylvanian trial, 'Lana' germinated well, but spring regrowth was slow and suppressed by weeds (Hofstetter, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is tolerant of moderately acid to moderately alkaline soils, according to Williams et al.  (1959); 'Lana' was said by Munoz & Graves (1988) to tolerate neutral to acid soils.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>This form requires 10 inches or more annual rainfall according to Williams et al.  (1959).  Murphy et al.  (1976), by contrast, gives the requirement as 16 inches or more, as echoed by Munoz & Graves (1988)<P> 'Lana' is resistant to waterlogging (Miller, 1988).<P> Stivers & Shennan (pers. comm.) found that cv 'Lana' under normal rainy winter conditions dried out the soil profile down to a depth of 24 inches relative to a winter fallow.  The actual amount of water lost in this drying out of the profile was less than 5 percent of the standard amount of irrigation water used to irrigate the summer cash crop.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>The appropriate rhizobia is inoculant type "C" (same as for other vetches and field pea, Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is more prostrate in growth habit than purple vetch (Williams et al., 1959).  Cv 'Lana' is semiprostrate with trailing stems (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986), and is very viney (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  The viny and succulent growth often constitutes a matted carpet two feet deep by springtime (Miller, 1988)<P> Based on replicated trials in Mendocino wine vineyards, cv 'Lana' shows a great tendency to climb (much greater than for purple or common vetch) and is, therefore, probably unsuitable in most vineyards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Williams et al.  (1959) advised some seedbed preparation, such as disking. Covering the seed, preferably by drilling, will improve the first year's stand.  Seed may be drilled or broadcast on a well-prepared seedbed (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Drilling gives better results than broadcasting seed into a prepared bed (Graves et al., 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' woollypod vetch should be sown from September-October (Slayback, pers. comm.), in early fall (Munoz & Graves, 1988), or in the fall (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  October is the best month, according to Williams et al. (1959), who stated that midwinter plantings are likely to be only moderately successful, even during mild winters.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' and purple vetch are the two most productive winter legumes grown in northern California (Miller, 1988).  Cv 'Lana' produced yields of 6000 lbs/acre dry matter when harvested at maximum growth at Davis (Miller et al., 1989), and 9.180+/-0.933 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) by mid-May in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California; weeds were entirely suppressed (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> Abd El Monem et al.  (1990) found that in Syria, rainfed woollypod vetch attained maximum biomass yield at 20-50% podding. By contrast, common vetch attained maximum biomass at maturity. Rainfed woollypod vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B> ssp. <I>dasycarpa</I></B>) at 102, 118 132, and 145 days after planting (D.A.P.) yielded 2.08, 4.01, 4.34, and 3.69 Mg/ha of dry matter during 1986- 87, and during 1987-88 at 115, 130, 144, and 163 D.A.P.  the corresponding figures were 2.58, 4.51, 5.88, and 5.68. To summarize, maximum biomass yields were obtained around 132-144 D.A.P, and those yields were 4.34 and 5.68 Mg/ha (Abd El Monem et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) wrote that vetch is best cut for hay when cut in full bloom. Vetch leaves dry much faster than the stems. Therefore, handle the hay rapidly in the field, to avoid loss of leaves by shattering.  One day in the swath usually suffices, then the hay is cured in shocks.<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Bugg (pers. comm.) noted that power spaders (e.g., those manufactured by Celli) are useful for immediate incorporation when soil is moist and with minimal resultant compaction.  Heavy disk harrows may otherwise be needed, but these can be more damaging to soil.  For mowing, flail choppers give the finest comminution but have less range of adjustment and may mow too close to allow regrowth.  Sickle-bar mowers may be workable only when the vetch has twined up a cereal companion crop and is dry. Rotary mowers give a greater range of adjustment than flail mowers; residue is left coarse, however.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' flowers attract bees (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Bugg (pers. comm.) noted that pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B>) and associated lady beetles (mainly <I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B>) and lacewings (mainly <I>Chrysoperla carnea</I></B>) occur on 'Lana' from mid April until maturity; flower thrips (<I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp.) and associated minute pirate bug (<I>Orius tristicolor</I></B>) are abundant in flowers.  Woollypod vetch lacks extrafloral (stipular) nectaries so is not very attractive to parasitic wasps.  Lygus bugs can be abundant.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>As indicated by Goar (1934), when grown for hay, silage, or cover crops, vetches and peas are usually sown along with a cereals.  Oat is most often used, but rye, wheat, or barley may also be used.  The cereal supports the vetch, preventing it from becoming wet and slimy near the ground, and facilitates harvesting. On fertile loamy soils where oat tillers or stools heavily, 10 lbs/acre of oat in mixture with vetch or peas usually suffices. On light soil, or if for other reasons the oat tillers little, seed oat at 15 to 25 lb./acre.  If rye is substituted for oat, use 15-25 lbs/acre, according to soil type and the tendency of the rye to tiller.  If the cereal and vetch or pea seeds are mixed before planting, stir the mixture often while drilling, to prevent the lighter seed (e.g., oat) from rising in the seed box, and causing an uneven stand.  For hay of high feeding value, seed cereal sparingly, with only enough to support the vetch and prevent lodging.<P> Williams et al.  (1959) wrote that when grown for hay, oat is often suggested as an intercrop for vetch because the former supports the latter and facilitates harvesting.  The oat variety 'Kanota' begins flowering at the same time the woollypod vetch is in late bloom, and is therefore a desirable companion.  These are the most nutritious stages of growth for hay production. Where hay containing dough-stage oat is desired with woollypod vetch, the variety 'Indio' is suggested.  The suggested planting rate is 30 lbs.  each per acre each of vetch and oat.<P> As related by Schenk and Werner (1991), various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and apparently is an allelopathic compound.  This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.<P> In rangeland plantings, woollypod vetch is compatible for planting in mixture with the annual grasses, 'Blando' brome, and annual ryegrass.  They may be added singly or in mixture at the rate of 4 lbs.  of grass seed per acre (Williams et al., 1959).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch smothers out weed competition (McLeod, 1982) with its dense growth and trailing stems (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> Bugg et al.  (unpublished data) conducted a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California. Cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990 and harvested on May 15-16, 1991.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  Plots seeded to cv 'Lana' showed no weed biomass production at all; of the 32 cover crops seeded, this was the only entry with that distinction.  Vegetational cover by 'Lana' in early May was 97.50+/-2.50 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P> Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and apparently is an allelopathic compound. This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected (Schenk and Werner, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is used successfully in mature walnut and citrus orchards, suggesting some tolerance of shading.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This form has been termed woollypod vetch (Williams et al., 1959; McLeod, 1982), woolypod vetch (Duke, 1981), and smooth vetch (Hermann, 1960).  Duke (1981) considered it a form of <I>Vicia villosa</I></B>, and thus the names winter vetch, hairy vetch, and sand vetch might also apply.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' was selected and developed at Pleasanton by the Soil Conservation Service Plant Materials Center, USDA, in cooperation with the Agronomy Dept. of the University of California, Davis, from material introduced from Turkey in 1937.  The original accession was assigned the number K1924 by the Agronomy Dept. and subsequently numbered P-13910 by the Pleasanton Center.  It has been used widely and successfully in California for seeding rangeland (Williams et al., 1959).<P> 'Auburn' and 'Oregon' are other cultivars (McLeod, 1982).  Cv 'Auburn' was selected and developed by the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station as a forage and cover crop and was certified for use in Alabama and California (Williams et al., 1959).<P> 'Lana' was the most recent successful vetch introduced to California (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The species names has been cited as <I> Vicia dasycarpa </I></B> Ten., Viagg. Abrezz.  81.  1829 (Hermann, 1960), <I>Vicia dasycarpa</I></B> Ten.  (Williams et al., 1959), <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> ssp.  <I>dasycarpa</I></B> (Duke, 1981; Abd El Monem et al., 1990), and <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth ssp.  <I>dasycarpa</I></B> Ten. (Bugg, 1992).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch was listed as annual or rarely perennial (Hermann, 1960).  In California, it behaves as a winter annual (Williams et al., 1959); cv 'Lana' starts growing in the fall, puts on most of its growth in early spring, and matures in late May (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  This vetch usually makes more growth during the winter and early spring than most vetches (Miller et al., 1989).  Nonetheless, cv 'Lana' makes most of its growth is in early spring and matures in late May (Graves et al., 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is the earliest maturing species of commercially available vetches, blooming about three weeks earlier than purple vetch (Williams et al., 1959).  Woollypod vetch matures earlier than hairy vetch (McLeod, 1982), and cv 'Lana' is counted the earliest-maturing vetch, with seed ripened by late May (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986).  It is the only variety that matures early enough to adjust to a short rainfall season (San Diego County) (Graves et al., 1986).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Williams et al. (1959) advised that for seed production, one should plant woollypod vetch at 5 lbs/acre with 5-foot row spacing. It is a prolific seed producer, but shatter creates a harvest problem.  Good seed recovery can be obtained by raking the field with a dump or sulky rake without mowing if the stand is heavy enough, otherwise mow and then rake.  After the crop has cured in the windrow, combine with a belt-type rubber pickup attachment. Direct combining is possible where the crop has matured uniformly and weather conditions are right.  Cylinder speeds of 4000 to 4500 feet per minute and cylinder spacing of 1/4 to 1/2 inch are recommended.  Miller et al. (1989) reiterated that for cv 'Lana' seed production is prolific, but that pods are prone to shattering.<P> Woollypod vetch has been grown for seed in California and Western Oregon (McLeod, 1982).  Finch and Sharp (1983) noted that cv 'Lana' requires a regrowth period (without mowing) of about 4 weeks before the late May maturity date in order to produce seed for the next year.  This was reiterated by Graves et al. (1986).<P> 'Lana' can maintain self-reseeding stands (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> In Syria, rainfed woollypod vetch yielded 1.26 and 1.14 Mg/ha of seeds in separate trials (Abd El Monem et al., 1990).<P> Abd El Monem et al. (1990) found that in Syria, rainfed woollypod vetch attained maximum biomass yield at 20-50% podding.  By contrast, common vetch attained maximum biomass at maturity.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch can be used for forage, cover crops, and green manure (McLeod, 1982; Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Cv 'Lana'can be used as living mulch for orchard, vegetable, and cereal cropping systems (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Williams et al. (1959) suggested that, as a cover crop, it may substitute for purple vetch, as it has outperformed the latter in several trials involving planting at a wide row spacing.  The relative price of seed may influence the choice.<P> Woollypod vetch is the preferred vetch for range seeding purposes; 'Lana' vetch offers the best nutritive quality and year-to-year persistence (Murphy et al., 1976).  It makes good hay either alone or in mixture with a cereal (Williams et al., 1959).<P> Vetches are useful as a source of spring feed but even more important as summer dry forage; also, their seeds are fed upon by upland game birds (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Cv 'Lana' is suitable in orchards and vineyards (Finch and Sharp, 1983), where a large amount of biomass is needed, but not where more than three mowings are used before April 1 (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  It is also very viney and may cause problems in vineyards (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>The forms used in California were introduced from Turkey (Williams et al., 1959).  Hermann (1960) mentioned that the species is naturalized in scattered locales from Maine to Montana, south to Georgia, Missouri, and California.  Munz (1973) listed woollypod vetch as a native of the Mediterranean region and as naturalized in Marin County of California.  It now appears naturalized in much of the Sacramento Valley north of Stockton, as well (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Woollypod vetch can grow in all areas of the U.S. during cool, moist weather (McLeod, 1982).<P> This form requires 10 inches or more annual rainfall and is restricted to elevations below 4,000 feet (Williams et al., 1959). The elevational limit was repeated by Graves et al. (1986) and Miller et al. (1989).  Finch and Sharp (1983) wrote that the form is well adapted in California below 3,000 ft.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is tolerant of early frosts, less winter hardy than hairy vetch, but hardier than purple vetch (Williams et al., 1959); where temperatures do not fluctuate widely or there is snow cover, it will stand 0 deg F or lower (McLeod, 1982).  Cv 'Lana' has been called resistant to frost (Miller, 1988) yet can grow rapidly during mild winters (Miller et al., 1989).  Stands survived the winter of 1990-1991 in the Sacramento area of California, where a severe advective freeze kept temperatures near 13 F for several days (Bugg, pers. comm.).  In plantings of cv 'Lana' at the Rodale Institute Research Center (Pennsylvania), most plants did not survive winter (Hofstetter, 1988).  Woollypod vetch grows better in cool weather than hairy vetch and is more heat tolerant (McLeod, 1982).  Cv 'Lana' performed well in trials at Ontario and Davis where winters are influenced somewhat by the ocean.  These trends seem to indicate a slight yield advantage to 'Lana' under coastal influence (Williams et al., 1959).  'Lana' should work in areas where winters are mild but cool, and summers are warm (Hofstetter, 1988).  Cv 'Auburn' looked best under the more extreme conditions in the the Central Valley, suggesting a slight yield advantage under more severe interior climatic conditions (Williams et al., 1959).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch is tolerant of moderately acid to moderately alkaline soils, according to Williams et al. (1959) (this was echoed by Murphy et al.  [1976] and Graves et al.  [1986] as regards moderately alkaline soils); it was said by McLeod (1982) to grow well on any soil, even poor, sandy lands.<P> Cv 'Lana' was said to tolerate loam to clay soils (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and to be well adapted to all orchard and vineyard soils in California below 3000 ft (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Woollypod vetch has a low lime requirement (McLeod, 1982).<P> On rangelands, fertilizing at time of planting with 200 to 500 lbs/acre of single superphosphate will suffice for the majority of range soils.  In areas where sulfur is lacking, 200 to 400 lbs. of gypsum per acre is adequate.  Refertilize every two or three years (Williams et al., 1959).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Depth of seeding should be 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Suggested seeding rates include 15 lbs/acre of inoculated seed (Williams et al., 1959), 15 lbs/acre (Finch and Sharp, 1983), 15 to 20 lbs/acre (Slayback, pers. comm.), 15 to 25 lbs/acre of raw seed (Graves et al., 1986), 20 lb/acre (Hofstetter, 1988), 25-50 lb/acre for cover crop or living mulch (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 30-60 lb/acre (Miller, 1988), 40 to 60 lbs/acre for rangeland (Miller et al., 1989), 50 to 60 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982), and 56-67 lb/acre for green manure (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana' cost about $0.90/lb in 1988 (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) in 1993 listed the market retail prices as $0.70.<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Cv 'Lana,' like other cover crops, should be turned under at flowering when used for green manure (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>If plowed under as a green manure, 'Lana' can reduce crusting and improve emergence of tomato seedlings (Miller, P.R. and Groody, K., L.  Stivers, and C.  Shennan, pers. comm.).<P>

This chapter presents an analysis of several experiments conducted
in Europe. The research focused on the effects of organic fertilizers
on nitrate leaching, and includes data from composting, lysimeter,
and field plot experiments. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Manure Use on Organic and Conventional Farms<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The authors make a clear distinction between the underlying reasons
for using manures on farms in Europe. In the conventional system,
manure is viewed as a waste which must be disposed of in the cheapest
and most convenient way possible. With organic farming methods,
on the other hand, manures are a valuable means for transferring
nutrients from one part of the farm or region to another. According
to the authors, many nitrate leaching studies have been conducted
using systems based primarily on the disposal of manures. As a
result, the negative aspects of such disposal are emphasized,
such as runoff and nutrient accumulation within a watershed; these
aspects are then attributed to the organic system as well. The
organic system is viewed by many people as relying solely upon
manures to supply nutrients and is therefore considered by these
people to be more polluting than conventional farms.<FONT SIZE=2>

<H3>Nutrient Losses During Composting</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="OLE_LINK6">This experiment utilized four compost windrows
which served as the control treatments in a larger mineral additive
study. The material was composted for 8 months. The composting
area was designed to allow collection of the leachates from the
individual compost piles. The authors present data from a previous
composting experiment showing the changes in nutrients after composting
(Table 1). The organic matter content decreased substantially
over the composting period; the loss of carbon led to increased
concentration of most nutrients. In absolute amounts, phosphorus
was very stable, while nitrogen and potassium were lost at a similar
rate. <BR>
<BR>
Results from the present experiment show that nitrate loss in
the leachate was relatively low (Table 2). On a quantitative basis,
the loss of nitrate was less than 0.1 pound of nitrate per ton
of fresh manure over the composting period. Much of the nitrogen
was likely lost to volatilization. Conversely, potassium escapes
mainly, if not exclusively, in a water soluble form. <BR>
</A>
<H3>Lysimeter Study<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Three different fertilizers, all applied on a nitrogen-equivalent
basis, were tested for nitrate leaching over 2 1/2 years: stockpiled
farmyard manure (FYM), composted FYM, and &quot;NPK fertilization.&quot;
The fertilizers were applied to soil in Iysimeters (metal cylinders)
38 cm in diameter and 60 cm tall. The initial application of chemical
nitrogen to a crop in the winter led to a much more rapid migration
of nitrate in the soil than did the organic fertilizers. During
the following winter fallow (after no fertilizers were applied
in the fall), this trend reversed. This pattern demonstrated the
slow release effect of manures and the need for cover cropping
during the winter to conserve nitrate. Nitrate leaching (and availability)
was usually less with composted FYM than with stockpiled FYM.
<BR>

<H3>Field Study<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The field experiment was designed to evaluate nitrate leaching
after fertilization with an &quot;NPK fertilizer,&quot; FYM, and
composted FYM. The materials were applied at two nitrogen rates
(50 to 80 kg/ha or 100 to 160 kg/ha) to plots of corn and wheat
crops over three years. <BR>
<BR>
Composted FYM led to the greatest increase in both soil organic
matter and soil nitrate content in the top 30 to 40 cm. However,
at the 120 cm depth (below the root zone), the chemical fertilizer
plots had two to three times more nitrate than the organically
fertilized plots. Leaching at this depth in the organically fertilized
plots did not differ from each other nor from the control plots.
The authors hypothesized that the high nitrate values obtained
in the upper soil levels with compost were due to mineralization
occurring at a time when the crop did not take it up anymore.
Nitrate has the same leaching potential from mineral or organic
fertilizers, however, the presence of lignin degradation products
(from compost) may regulate mineralization or nitrate mobility.
While nitrate levels in the root zone were highest in the composted
plots, corn yields with compost were lower than yields with manure,
probably because of the reduced availability of nitrate. <BR>

<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Sorghum produces a large volumes of biomass in 2-3 months (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  Sorghum-sudangrass hybrids produce more biomass than does sudangrass (Schonbeck, 1988). When sorghums are cut for hay, each of 5 harvests can yield 2 Mg/ha or more.  Total dry matter production by sorghum or pearl millet can range from 15-20 Mg/ha (Fribourg, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Sorghum should be seeded at a depth of 1 inch (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983), or 1-5 cm (Fribourg, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Sorghum does best on fairly fertilie soil (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>Sudangrass and sorghum are both in the species <I>Sorghum bicolor</I></B> (L.) Moench (Munz, 1973; Fribourg, 1985).  Sudangrass was formerly <I>Sorghum sudanense</I></B> (Piper) Stapf. (Hitchcock, 1971) and <I>Sorghum vulgare</I></B> var. <I>sudanese</I></B> Hitchcock (Marks and Townsend, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>The common name is sorghum, Sudangrass, or Sudan grass (Marks and Townsend, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>De Queiroz and Galwey (1987) grew five sorghum (S1006, 2219 B, CSH 5, CSH 6, and Ethiopian landrace E 35-1) and 2 cowpea varieties (the semi-erect C 152 and the spreading, later-maturing GFC 4) as sole crops and in sorghum-cowpea bicultures during the dry season. There was no significant effect of cowpea variety on sorghum yield, nor of sorghum variety on cowpea.  This will probably not be the case for rainy-season plantings, in which sorghum tends to shade the intercrop more completely.  For dry-season plantings, the authors suggested that a single cowpea variety might be used to evaluate sorghum performance in biculture.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Smith and Sharpley (1990) found that incorporation of non-legume (high C:N ratio) residues (e.g., corn) led to depression of N availability greater than that for surface residues.  N availability was in this order for crop residues: alfalfa > peanut > soybean > oat > sorghum > wheat > corn.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Marks and Townshend (1973) found that sudan grass and buckwheat (<I>Fagopyrum esculentum</I></B> Moench) harbored particularly-high densities of root lesion nematode (<I>Pratylynchus penetrans</I></B>).<P> Rhoades (1983) found that sting nematode was abundant and caused reduced yields for cool-season vegetables following cover cropping with a sorghum X Sudan grass hybrid.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Sudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass hybrids are fast-growing summer annuals that can be used to suppress weeds or provide mulch or soil structural improvement (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Sorghums produce high volumes of high quality forage during the warm-season (Fribourg, 1985).  Sudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass hybrids produce toxic levels of cyanide while young, so should only be grazed when more mature (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> There is substantial documentation regarding prussic acid poisoning to livestock with new growth or frosted sudan or sorghum x sudan.  This is the one major problem in some livestock situations.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>

<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>According to Fribourg (1985), sorghum is a coarse, erect grass with variable growth characteristics, and height ranging from 0.45 to over 5 m.  Some cultivars tiller early, whereas others do not until maturity or when the plant is damaged.  The inflorescence is a panicle containing up to 6,000 fertile spikelets.  The plant is usually self pollinated.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Fribourg (1985) stated that there are about 25,000-60,000 seeds/kg for grain sorghums, and about 120,000-150,000 seeds/kg for forage sorghums.  Seeds may be white, yellow, red, or brown, with the darker-colored seed being higher in tannin.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Sorghums can grow where precipitation is as low as 400-650 mm, but do better with more water; drought may induce temporary dormancy.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>In southern Georgia, in an experimental grove of pecan (<I>Carya illinoensis</I></B> [Wangenh.] K.  Koch [Juglandaceae]), Bugg and Dutcher (1989) surveyed potential "insectary crops." Thirteen prospective warm-season cover crops were evaluated for associated aphids and entomophagous insects; an additional 11 crops or mixtures were considered in unreplicated plots.  A Sorghum X Sudangrass hybrid (<I>Sorghum bicolor</I></B> [L.] Moench cultivar 'Kow Kandy', Sorghum hosted corn leaf aphid (<I>Rhopalosiphum maidis</I></B> [Fitch]) and greenbug (<I>Schizaphis graminum</I></B> [Rondani]).  Corn leaf aphid was first observed on sorghum, during the week of July 19, and colonies were observed on spikelets of sorghum from early September until frost in late November.  After pecan leaf drop in October, <I>O. v-nigrum</I></B> was often observed feeding on this aphid.  Sorghum can also harbor abundant southern green stinkbug, <I>Nezara viridula</I></B>, and leaffooted bug, <I>Leptoglossus phyllopus</I></B> (L.)(Bugg, pers. comm.), both of which are kernal-feeding pests of pecan.<P> On Cape Cod Massachusetts, Bugg and Ellis (1989) evaluated insect faunae of ten cover crops grown in two replicated trials.  Five crops were assessed in the principal experiment: (1) Faba bean, <I>Vicia faba</I></B> L.  cv 'Ipro' (Fabaceae); (2) Hairy vetch, <I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth (Poaceae), planted in mixture with rye, <I>Secale cereale</I></B> L.  cv 'Aroostook' (Poaceae); (3) Annual white sweetclover, <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux var. <I>annua</I></B> Coe cv 'Hubam' (Fabaceae); (4) Grain sorghum, <I>Sorghum bicolor</I></B> (L.) Moench cv RS-610 (TE-66) (Poaceae); and (5) Buckwheat, <I>Fagopyrum esculentum</I></B> Moench (Polygonaceae).  Sorghum featured high densities of corn leaf aphid, <I>Rhopalosiphum maidis</I></B> (Fitch), and seven-spotted lady beetle, <I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> L.  during the first three weeks of July.<P>

<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) presented a lengthy list of pathogens afflicting common pea.<P> According to Auld et al. (1979), field pea is susceptible to Fusarium Wilt Race 1, sclerotinia white mold, and powdery mildew. These diseases can cause serious losses under some conditions. Ascochyta is one of the most serious diseases of Austrian winter peas.  This fungus in the form of foliar blight can destroy leaf and stem tissue or it can attack the root and underground stem of the pea as a foot rot.  Melrose has better tolerance to this disease than other cultivars.<P> Winter oat, winter rape, winter pea, and spring faba bean as break crops greatly reduced the incidence of take-all of wheat (<I>Gaeumannomyces graminis</I></B>) (McEwen et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), seed should be sown 5-7.5 cm apart, at a depth of 2.5-7.5 cm., with rows separated by 0.6-0.9 m; field pea is often intercropped with cereals.  Especially on pre-irrigated land, seed should be drilled sufficiently deep to contact moist soil, 2 in. or more in depth, if necessary.  Delayed plantings should be made closer to the surface (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The most common varieties of field peas used in California are Austrian winter pea and its derivatives.  Two strains, the 'Early Austrian' and the 'Dixie Wonder,' are selections of the Austrian winter pea and differ only in that they mature earlier (Miller et al., 1989).<P> 'Austrian Winter' has been largely replaced by the field pea varieties 'Melrose' and 'Glacier' (Hoveland and Townsend, 1985). 'Melrose' was selected from progeny of a cross between common Austrian winter pea and powdery mildew resistant 'Perfection,' a spring pea (Auld et al., 1979).<P> 'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>The Southern Seedsmen's Association 1990-1991 Directory and Buyers' Guide listed 37 distributors of field pea seed.  Austrian Winter Pea has been grown in California for seed, some for sale in the southern states (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Dry matter yields (Mg/ha) obtained in individual studies were given as: 5.6, 1.7, 1.8 (Smith et al., 1987); above-ground dry biomasses of Austrian winter pea straw were 8.0 and 8.5 Mg/ha in separate trials in Idaho (Mahler and Auld, 1989).  Mid-May above-ground harvest of 'Austrian Winter' in Hopland, Mendocino County, California yielded 6.891+/-0.744 Mg/ha, Mean +/-S.E.M. (Bugg et al., unpublished data); with associated weeds included, the corresponding figures were 7.203+/-0.654 Mg/ha.<P> Field pea is later to start putting on biomass and fixing N in spring than some other legumes (Stivers & Shennan, pers. comm.) but can produce as well if permitted to grow until May (Miller et al. 1989).<P> At maturity, pea (Cv 'Early Dun') contained 34% of its total dry matter and 56% of its total N (90 kg/ha) in the seed, 60 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Field pea is an annual herb, bushy or climbing, glabrous, usually glaucous; stems are weak, round, and slender (Duke, 1981). The plant is very viny, with weak, small stems (though larger and more succulent than those of vetches) and requires a supporting crop, such as oat or rye, in order to ascend (Goar, 1934).  Flowers are white, pink, or purple (Duke, 1981) and are borne singly or in pairs on long stems; usually two leaflets and a tendril constitute the leaf (Goar, 1934).<P> Cv 'Melrose' has purple flowers which occur indeterminately in early June above the 16th node; two to three pods form per peduncle.  At maturity, length of vines may exceed 5 feet.  Root nodules are abundant (Auld et al., 1979).<P> At maturity, pea (cv 'Early Dun') contained 34% of its total dry matter and 56% of its total N (90 kg/ha) in the seed, 60 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds are globose or angled, smooth or wrinkled, exalbuminous, whitish, gray, green, or brown; 100 seeds weigh 15-25 g (Duke, 1981).  The seeds are larger than those of common vetch and are almost spherical; they are pale green to brown, covered with numerous specks of a darker coloring; black seed scar is relatively small (Goar, 1934).<P> Cv 'Melrose' has a chocolate-brown seed coat (Auld et al., 1979).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Common pea ranges from the Boreal Moist to Wet through the Tropical Very Dry Forest Zone (Duke, 1981).  Field pea is especially adapted to the interior valleys and to the foothills sections of California (Goar, 1934).  Munz (1971) listed field pea as an occasional escape from cultivation in California.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Spring sown 'Austrian Winter' pea attain a height of about 0.45 m in coastal Massachusetts (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).  In Hopland, Mendocino County, California, height of fall-sown cv 'Austrian Winter' was 66.68+/-4.32 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that peas show little salinity tolerance, with yields declining with EC=3-5 mmhos.  <I>Pisum sativum</I></B>, cv 'DMR 11' and 'Bonneville' were sown in plots with differing soil salinities.  The 'DMR 11' pea showed 100% germination up to salinities of ECe 9 dS/m, but 'Bonneville' had 100% germination only up to 6.0 dS.m.  At ECe 12 dS/m, germination was 34 and 16% for 'DMR 11' and 'Bonneville'.  'DMR 11' and 'Bonneville' varieties of pea were deemed moderately tolerant and moderately sensitive to salinity (Dua et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Appears highly palatable to, and easily damaged by, rabbits and ground squirrels (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Field pea flowers in from 32-55 days (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Field pea matures seed from 20-30 days after bloom or 52-75 days after planting (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD><I>Pisum sativum</I></B> is subject to attack by 39 species of plant-parasitic nematodes (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Germination of pea is cryptocotylar; optimum temperature for germination is 24 degrees C (Duke, 1981).  Emergence of pea seedlings was unaffected by soil crust formation, by contrast with the situation for narrow-leafed lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B>) and medics (<I>Medicago</I></B> spp.), which were severely damaged (White and Robson, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea.  However, this is not due to to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture (White and Robson, 1989).<P> An experiment with pea grown using a split-root procedure suggested that at the time of harvest 22-46% of the below-ground N had been shed into the rhizosphere (root zone).  Because this N "rhizodeposition" has not previously been assessed for annual legumes, nitrogen fixation may be underestimated by about 10% (Swatsky and Soper, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Pisum sativum</I></B> L., or <I>Pisum sativum</I></B> L. ssp. <I>arvense</I></B> (L.) Poir. (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Common pea grows well on a wide range of soil types, but is intolerant of waterlogging (Goar, 1934; Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982). Loam to clay soils are suitable (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and field pea will produce on any soil that will produce oat (McLeod, 1982). Sand can predispose for drought problems because field pea roots are shallow (McLeod, 1982).<P> Loam to Heavy Soils - Adapted to large range of soil types (Madson, 1951).<P> Lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea.  However, this is not due to to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L. cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture (White and Robson, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Common pea grows in soil pH ranging from 4.2-8.3, with a mean of 122 cases of 6.3; optimal range is variously given as 5.5-6.5, 5.5-6.8, and 6.00-7.50 (Duke, 1981).  According to Munoz & Graves (1988), field pea tolerates basic to acid soil conditions.<P> Lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea.  However, this is not due to to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L. cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture (White and Robson, 1989).<P>

<DD>Seeding should be in early fall according to Munoz & Graves (1988) and, in October-November, according to Madson (1951). 'Melrose' should be sown during early to mid-September to obtain highest yields.<P> According to Auld et al. (1979), early fall seeding increases winter survivability and leads to larger plants better able to compensate for pea leaf weevil attack the following spring.  Early fall-seeded peas flower earlier, avoiding hot weather that can decrease seed production.  Early seeding also reduces soil erosion<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>'Austrian Winter' pea is a winter annual in the South and a summer annual in the North (Miller, 1984).  It is a winter annual in most of California but can be grown during the summer in cool coastal areas (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Like most other winter-hardy annuals, it grows little during cold weather but rapidly during spring (Goar, 1934).  Because of the winter dormancy, most growth is made too late for field pea to be of use as a cover crop (Miller et al., 1989).<P> The literature review by Buttery and Gibson (1990) indicated that N-fixation by pea reaches a maximum before or at flowering and drops during pod formation, whereas in faba bean substantial fixation continues up to plant maturity.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>When field pea grows vigorously, it outcompetes and helps to reduce weeds, according to McLeod (1982).  By contrast, Miller, (1988) wrote that field pea is a poor competitor in areas with abundant winter weed growth.<P> Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound. This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected (Schenk and Werner, 1991).<P> A long-vined variety of field pea ('Century') was better than a short-vined variety ('Alaska') at suppressing mustard growth by shading.  'Century' also showed a greater yield (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).  'Century' variety of field pea also performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P> Intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B. hirta</I></B>) than was a dense monoculture of barley.  The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley) (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).<P> High-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture. Weed populations were not reduced, but biomass was (Mohler and Liebman, 1987).<P> In Mendocino County, California, weed above-ground dry biomass (dry) in vineyard plots seeded to 'Austrian Winter' pea was 0.312+/-0.258 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.  This is 6.35% of the weed biomass in control plots.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherdspurse, rattail fescue, and darnel (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  The 'Austrian Winter' field pea provided 96.25+/-3.75 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) by early May (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates are given as 70 to 90 lb/acre (Madson, 1951; McLeod, 1982; Miller et al., 1989), 80-120 lb/acre (Miller, 1988), and 100-150 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> According to Auld et al. (1979), seeding rate should be 75 lbs/acre on September 15.  Increase seeding rate one lb for every day seeding is delayed.  In rough seed beds, increase seeding rates an additional 15 to 25 lbs/acre.<P> If broadcast seeded, field pea plants will fall down and rot if the crop is not sown thickly or with a nurse crop (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Munoz & Graves (1988) gave the price of field pea seed as $.085/lb.  The high price, combined with the large amount of seed required to plant an acre, makes seeding expensive (Miller et al., 1989).  During 1993, Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price for 'Austrian Winter' as $0.35/lb and for 'Magnus' as $0.40/lb.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Pea should be inoculated with <I>Rhizobium leguminosarum</I></B> (Nitragin Inoculant Type "C") (Nitragin Company, Inc., No Date), which is the same type as used for various vetches (<I>Vicia</I></B> spp.) (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Inoculation is essential for good growth (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Field pea should be turned under at flowering (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Above-ground nitrogen contents of Austrian winter pea were 128 and 203 kg/ha in separate trials in Idaho (Mahler and Auld, 1989). N content can range from 100-200 lb/acre, according to Munoz & Graves (1988).  Stivers & Shennan (pers. comm.) estimated 150 lb N/ac by late March.  Based on the mean N proportion of 0.01994 obtained from the data of Mahler and Auld (1989), the biomass yields of 5.6, 1.7, 1.8 reported by Smith et al.  (1987) translate as 111.67, 33.90, and 17.33 kg N/ha; reports of a mean above-ground biomass of 6.891+/-0.744 Mg/ha (Mean +/-S.E.M.) translate to 137.41 +/- 14.84 kg N/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> For the field pea cv 'Early Dun,' N fixation began 20 days after sowing and stopped when seed began to fill.  At maturity, 34% of the total dry matter and 56% of the total N (90 kg/ha) was contained in the seed, 60 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P> The literature review indicates that N-fixation by pea reaches a maximum before or at flowering and drops during pod formation, whereas in faba bean substantial fixation continues up to plant maturity (Buttery and Gibson, 1990).<P> An experiment with pea grown using a split-root procedure suggested that at the time of harvest, 22-46% of the below-ground N had been shed into the rhizosphere (root zone).  Because this N "rhizodeposition" has not previously been assessed for annual legumes, nitrogen fixation may be underestimated by about 10% (Swatsky and Soper, 1991).<P> In Idaho, according to Mahler and Auld, (1989), it was more efficient to harvest Austrian winter peas for seed than to use them for green manure.  A seed pea-winter wheat-spring barley rotation was the most efficient.  Despite the harvesting of the seeds, Austrian winter pea residues led to the equivalent of 75 kg/ha of nitrogen available to the following crop, as compared to 94 kg/ha following peas used for green manure and 68 kg/ha following summer fallow.  The nitrogen yields from summer fallow are not sustainable because they result from gradual decomposition of a finite supply of soil organic matter.<P> In an experiment on rotational cash crops ("break crops") for wheat farmers, fertilizer N requirements were increased by 10 kg/ha following winter oat; decreased by 30 kg/ha following winter rape, winter peas, spring faba beans, or cultivated fallow; and decreased by 40 kg/ha following spring peas (McEwen et al., 1989).<P> On a sandy soil in New Delhi, India, return of field pea stover (crop minus the seeds) to the soil increased the amount of N available to subsequent maize by 16.2 kg/ha (Seth and Balyan, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>In coastal Massachusetts, spring-planted 'Austrian Winter' pea harbored pea aphid and the associated predators <I>Toxomerus</I></B> spp.  (syrphid flies) and seven-spotted lady beetle, <I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B>.  At various times during July and early August, 'Austrian Winter' pea/rye and Canadian field pea/rye harbored relatively high densities of aphids (pea aphid, corn leaf aphid, and English grain aphid, pooled).  Whole-plot visual inspection showed that 'Austrian Winter' pea exhibited the highest densities of aphidophaga on July 8th and 11th (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P> Infestation by pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B>) can actually stimulate pea production on nodes (Badenhausser et al., 1991).<P> Cv 'Melrose' can tolerate only limited populations of pea leaf weevil (Auld et al., 1979).<P> Flowers of field pea attract bees (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Field pea can be used for forage, hay, silage, grain and green manure (McLeod, 1982).  Hay is of very good quality, but pea is more succulent than vetches and more difficult to cure.  For hay production in California, 'Austrian Winter' was the best variety, according to Goar (1934).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Field pea does not regrow well after mowing or grazing (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Field pea has been successfully used as part of cover crop mixtures in walnut (West Sacramento, California) and citrus (Porterville) orchard understories; the former are densely shaded from April through November; the latter are evergreen and afford moderate shade throughout the year (Bugg, pers. comm.).  In light of field pea's intolerance of hot weather (Duke, 1981), some shade is probably beneficial if autumn or spring weather turns hot (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>The following is based on Duke's (1981) account.  Soil prepation prior to seeding is important, including the creation of a smooth surface, so that planting depth is uniform. Interseeding field pea and cereal grains is common. During hot weather, field pea germination is rapid, but seedlings may die from pathogens.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Avoid creating waterlogged conditions, because field pea does not tolerate these (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Pods are harvested when yellow but not open (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Normal seed drills, mowers, and tillage implements are appropriate for field peas.<P>

<DD>Dried peas are eaten by livestock (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Common pea tolerates mean annual temperatures of 5.0-27.5 degrees C, with the mean of 137 cases being 12.9.  Germination can occur at 4.5 C, but optimal temperature for germination is 24 degrees C.  Higher temperatures may accelerate germination but increase seedling susceptibility to soilborne pathogens (Duke, 1981).<P> Field pea grows in the winter where the climate is mild or in the spring where the winters are too severe for growth.  The plant requires cool, moist growing conditions and can withstand heavy frost; however, it succumbs quickly to heat, especially if combined with humidity (McLeod, 1982). Cold resistance is due to winter dormancy (Madson, 1951; Miller et al., 1989).  Cv 'Melrose' shows excellent winter hardiness (Auld et al., 1979).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>When grown for hay, silage, or green manure, vetches and peas are often interseeded with cereals which will support the legumes. Oat is most commonly used, but rye, wheat, or barley are occasionally preferred by the growers (Goar, 1934).  Pea (cv 'Trapper') can successfully twine on intercrops of rape, mustard, and oat, but not so well on flax.  Successful twining reduces lodging of the pea (Cowell et al., 1989).<P> In two of five experimental sites, percentage of nitrogen obtained by fixation was greater when legumes were intercropped with non-legumes. However, total nitrogen fixed was almost always less with intercropping (siginficantly so at two sites). Transfer of nitrogen from legume to non-legume was apparently minimal, based on N-15 enrichment experiments (Cowell et al., 1989).<P> A long-vined variety of field pea ('Century') was better than a short- vined variety ('Alaska') at suppressing mustard growth by shading.  'Century' also showed a greater yield (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).<P> Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (pea, lentil, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound. This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected. (Schenk and Werner, 1991).<P> Intercropped barley and field pea were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B>) and white mustard (<I>B. hirta</I></B>) than was a dense monoculture of barley.  The main mechanisms of weed suppression were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen (especially by the barley) (Liebman and Robichaux, 1990).<P> High-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture. Weed populations were not reduced, but weed biomass was (Mohler and Liebman, 1987).<P> 'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P> Vetch or Austrian winter pea is good in mixtures with oat in California because they reach the ideal stage of maturity at the same time (Goar, 1934).  Pea and oat are one of the best mixtures for hay, and oat is the best nurse crop for field pea (McLeod, 1982).<P> Monocultures of oat (<I>Avena sativa</I></B>, cv 'Mulga') or triticale yielded more dry matter and digestible organic matter than did bicultures involving common vetch (<I>Vicia sativa</I></B>) or pea (<I>Pisum sativum</I></B>).  Yields of mixtures did exceed those of monocultures of the relevant legumes. Digestibility and crude protein content were highest in mixtures of peas and triticale. There appears little incentive for farmers to grow mixtures of annual legumes and small-grained cereals for forage production (Droushiotis, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Common pea tolerates annual precipitation of from 0.9 to 27.8 dm with a mean of 137 cases of 9.2 (Duke, 1981).  Field pea requires cool, moist growing conditions (McLeod, 1982) and shows a 20-inch irrigation requirement (less any rainfall) (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> A study by Mohler and Liebman (1987) indicated that high-density plantings of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped barley and field pea.  Weed suppression appeared to be due to competition for soil moisture.  Weed populations were not reduced, but weed biomass was.<P> A trial by Liebman (1989) indicated that 'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Common pea seed yields average 1,725 kg/ha in the U.S.A. (Duke, 1981).  Heat is disastrous to seed production and, when grown on fertile soils, rank vegetative growth may occur but few pods (McLeod, 1982).  Cv 'Melrose' yielded between 1,800 and 2,000 lbs/acre, outyielding other varieties in 9 of 10 trials conducted at University of Idaho from 1973 to 1979 (Auld et al., 1979).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Field pea is shallow rooted and, therefore, subject to drought on sandy soils (McLeod, 1982).<P> An experiment with pea grown using a split-root procedure suggested that at the time of harvest 22-46% of the below-ground N had been shed into the rhizosphere (root zone).  Because this N "rhizodeposition" has not previously been assessed for annual legumes, nitrogen fixation may be underestimated by about 10% (Swatsky and Soper, 1991).<P> At maturity, pea (cv 'Early Dun') contained 34% of its total dry matter and 56% of its total N (90 kg/ha) in the seed, 60 kg/ha in the stubble, and 6-8% of the N fixed (less than 15 kg N/ha) in the root system (Herdina and Silsbury, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Common pea, requires moderately fertile soil, and is relatively unresponsive to fertilizers but often does benefit from added P or K (Duke, 1981).  This species does well on calcareous soils (McLeod, 1982).<P> Lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea.  However, this is not due to to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture (White and Robson, 1989).<P> 'Century' variety of field pea performed well in trispecific mixes (pea - barley - white mustard) even with high soil nitrogen.  The smaller 'Alaska' pea did well in such mixtures with high water and low nitrogen (Liebman, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding depths are 2.5-7.5 cm (1-3 inches) (Duke, 1981), 1-1/2 inches (McLeod, 1982), and 1.5 to 2.5 inches according to moisture conditions (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Seed of field pea remains viable for a relatively short time (McLeod, 1982). Immerse seeds in boiling water for two minutes to kill pea bug (Abstractor's note: presumably this indicates pea weevil, <I>Bruchus pisorum</I></B> - - R.L. Bugg); this brief exposure will not harm the seed (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Field pea is an annual herb (Duke, 1981); growth habit is low and viny (Miller, 1988); the small, weak stems will not permit upright growth without a supporting crop, such as oat or rye (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This form has been termed field pea (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982) and Austrian winter pea (Munoz & Graves, 1988), but it is completely interfertile with other forms of <I>Pisum sativum</I></B>, and is therefore sometimes grouped with common pea or garden pea (Duke, 1981).<P>

<H1>Beyond Cost/Benefit Farming Research</H1>
<P>
<I>by David Campbell SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Editor's Note:</B> <I>David Campbell has joined SAREP as an
economics and public policy analyst.  He also teaches in the UC
Davis political science department.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<B>Kenneth Dahlberg</B> lamented in <I>New Directions in Agriculture
and Agricultural Research </I>(1986) that &quot;we have few conceptual
means, much less the necessary data sets, to assess either general
societal benefits or costs of agriculture and agricultural research.&quot;
 He went on to call for &quot;greater research into health, safety,
social, environmental and resource externalities.&quot;<BR>
<P>
SAREP has been working systematically to determine how our program
might sponsor research and education that meets the challenge
of linking food production practices to the broader economic and
political context.  As reported in Vol.2, No.2 our Economics and
Public Policy Advisory Committee has developed a comprehensive
research agenda addressing economic, social and public policy
issues that affect agricultural sustainability.  Specific recommendations
were made in four areas:  food and agriculture policy, labor,
land use, and rural community development.<BR>
<P>
A prerequisite to pursuing many of the questions raised by the
committee is a clearer sense of how to build more complete cost-benefit
assessments into agricultural research.  Traditional farming research
methods, grounded in narrowly conceived cost-benefit accounting,
fail to adequately account for the impact of farming practices
on the environment, public health, worker safety, and rural community
development.  We need new methods, concepts and indicators that
include the effect of outside influences in the farming balance
sheet.<BR>
<P>
The World Resources Institute has developed a method of natural
resource accounting which makes possible quantitative measures
of sustainability.  By taking soil erosion and depreciation into
account, they can compare the net economic value of conventional
and more environmentally sensitive farms in a way not possible
if one were only to measure net farm income.  This as part of
a broader effort to redefine agricultural productivity to take
into account groundwater, soil fertility, and wildlife in addition
to the crop produced.  <I>(Reducing the Farm Bill:  Agricultural
Policy and the Adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices,
</I>published this spring by The World Resources Institute).<BR>
<P>
Other examples of innovative methods exist, but little work has
been done to systematically identify these and ask how they might
be profitably incorporated into ongoing agricultural research.
 SAREP staff members are laying the groundwork for educational
projects that would accomplish this objective.  The aim is to
identity and link individuals doing relevant research; clarify
data availability and needs; highlight innovative new methods;
and allow sharing of concrete, ready-to-implement techniques for
integrating these methods into agricultural research projects.
 We hope to build environmental and social costs assessments into
our research funding proposals in a systematic fashion and serve
as a model for other university research programs.<BR>
<P>
The effort to recast the methodological foundations for agricultural
research necessarily means greater involvement of social scientists
as part of interdisciplinary research teams.  Most of the research
to document the true costs of agriculture has been by social scientists
grounded in their own disciplines with little or no ongoing connection
to agricultural research programs.  Thus, no matter how persuasive
their analysis, they have tended to have little impact on the
direction of agricultural research.  And, these social scientists
have not benefited in most cases from the perspective of production-oriented
researchers.<BR>
<P>
One of the contributions SAREP hopes to make in economics and
public policy is the development of interdisciplinary teams. that
address sustainability issues from many perspectives.<BR>
<P>
Having already sponsored interdisciplinary work in production-oriented
disciplines, we are aware of the personal and institutional difficulties
that accompany this team-building.  Going forward with this broad
research is essential to addressing the sustainability question
in its most inclusive sense.<BR>
<P>
It is easy to become overwhelmed as we confront the dizzying array
of policies that affect agriculture at the national, state and
local levels, and the long list of neglected research questions
on the off-farm impacts of farming practices.<BR>
<P>
By focusing on the methodological and organizational tasks outlined
here, SAREP can began to establish a solid foundation for future
research.<BR>

<H1>International conference on the assessment and monitoring
of soil quality</H1>

<P>
Proceedings of a conference hosted by the Rodale Institute, July
11-13, 1991. Emmaus, PA. 1991<BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;Our responsibility is to return to the soil the vitality
it so generously shares with us and to ensure that vitality for
generations to come.&quot;</I>
<P>
      -John Haberern, president of Rodale Institute<BR>
<P>
This conference report documents the first steps of a national
effort to define and describe methods of enhancing soil quality.
 The premise of the conference is that soil is a vital resource
for human survival, and as such, we must manage it to ensure long-term
agricultural productivity.  As summarized in the conference conclusions,
any definition or discussion of soil quality issues should address
the three major functions that soil serves on our planet: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>soil is an essential link in the cycle of life
<LI>soil is a medium for the growth of plants and animals 
<LI>soil acts as an environmental buffer.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><B>The Scientific viewpoint</B></H3>
<P>
From a scientific viewpoint, the purposes of the meeting were
(1) to determine how soil quality can be characterized, (2) to
establish the key indicators of soil quality, and (3) to discuss
how these indicators can be monitored in the field and reported
in the form of an index.  To accomplish this, a working group
session was organized to develop an operational framework for
addressing soil quality issues.  This session led to the formulation
of a multi-level structure for defining which soil properties
to use in monitoring soil quality.  The hierarchy that was developed
can be summarized as follows:<BR>
<P>
A. First define the target area or agroecosystem in which you
are working.<BR>
<P>
B. Next, assess how soil quality affects three key components
of the agricultural system:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>plant and animal productivity,
<LI>the environment, and
<LI>human health.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
C. Determine which &quot;meso-level&quot; components of soil quality
(e.g. tilth, fertility, nutrition, presence of toxics) have the
strongest influence on each of the above components.<BR>
<P>
D. For each component (productivity, environment, human health),
examine the related &quot;first order&quot; soil properties.<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Chemical: electrical conductivity, pH, site-specific toxicities.
<LI>Physical: soil texture, water holding capacity, bulk density,
infiltration rate, soil depth.
<LI>Biological: soil organic matter, microbial biomass, earthworm
abundance, vegetation.
</OL>
<P>
<P>
E. Continue with a closer assessment of &quot;second order&quot;
properties such as aggregate stability, amount of dispersable
clay, and the numbers and diversity of key soil fauna and flora.
<BR>
<P>
Conference participants were challenged to take the next step
of integrating the many components into a useful index.  It was
proposed that the index be expressed in equation form as a function
of the various factors outlined above.  The index would therefore
be based on standard soil property analyses and soil survey methods
to establish a base line measure for soil quality.  It would also
be dependent on continuous monitoring and comparisons with long-term
research sites in order to identify the direction of soil quality
change (particularly the risk of soil degradation), and estimate
the rate of soil quality change.  Some soil quality factors would
be weighted more or less depending on the particular location
and conditions.<BR>
<H3><B>Broader Perspective Needed</B></H3>
<P>
The working group concluded that the effects of soil quality on
human health are the least studied and possibly the most complex
of the three major soil quality issues.  In spite of the fact
that sustaining a healthy population is a fundamental goal of
agriculture, we tend to focus primarily on production and usually
ignore the nutritive content of food and its effects on human
health.  There are examples from the literature that clearly show
that food nutritive content varies with soil characteristics (see
<I>Components </I>3(1):9-10).  Soil factors, climate and management
practices can all play an important role in determining the ultimate
nutritional quality of plants. Therefore, one recommendation from
the conference was that a greater effort should be made on routine
testing of food quality for crops grown under various management
practices.  In addition to standard nutrient and mineral analyses,
researchers need to develop bioassays that can replace expensive
animal feeding trials.<BR>
<H3><B>Conference Recommendations</B></H3>
<P>
Several other recommendations from the conference include:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>A working task force should be established to further develop
the components of a soil quality index, to assess the state-of-the-art
in understanding soil quality, set research priorities, and to
develop a strategy for implementing an international program for
assessing and monitoring soil quality.
<LI>Establish a working group specifically charged with summarizing
the indicators of, and approaches to, soil quality. This group
would develop a handbook of approaches and standardized methods
for measuring soil quality.
<LI>Establish, with adequate support, a research group dedicated
to evaluating various models and approaches that assess and monitor
soil quality. This group would interact closely with the working
group assigned to developing the &quot;Methods&quot; handbook,
and should also address the human health issue discussed above.
<LI>The scientific community needs to promote further research
on relationships between soil and crop management, soil quality,
food quality and human and animal health.
<LI>International research centers should be encouraged to identify
research on soil quality as part of their mission.

<H3>Conference Proceedings</H3>

<P>Environmental Enhancement Through Agriculture, 1995, $20. Includes the
paper by <B>Ellen Rilla</B> and <B>Stephanie Larson</B> of UC Cooperative
Extension excerpted in this issue of Sustainable Agriculture. This volume
develops the idea of an agriculture that serves the environment rather
than conflicting with it. Its 36 papers offer examples of agricultural
systems that benefit the environment in diverse ways: increasing wildlife
habitat and biodiversity; protecting water quality in streams and estuaries;
producing substitutes for nonrenewable energy sources; turning urban waste
into a resource instead of a problem; offering aesthetically appealing
landscapes; and bringing urban residents into closer contact with food
production and the land. The papers are from a conference in Boston, Mass.,
in November 1995 sponsored by the Tufts University School of Nutrition
Science and Policy, the American Farmland Trust, and the Henry A. Wallace
Institute for Alternative Agriculture. Copies are $20, postpaid. Send checks
(US funds only) payable to &quot;Trustees of Tufts College&quot; to Center
for Agriculture, Food and Environment, School of Nutrition, Science and
Policy, Tufts University, Medford, MA 02155.</P>

<B><DL><DT><A HREF="/cgi-win/ccrop.exe/show_imgs_13">Images of Clovers (Trifolium)</A></B><BR></DL>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Clovers (<I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.) should be inoculated with <I>Rhizobium trifolii</I></B> (Nitragin Inoculant Types "B", "R", "O", or "WR" depending on the species of clover) (Nitragin Company, Inc., No Date).  Survival of rhizobia is extended by use of coating materials that adhere the inoculant to the seed; nonetheless, sow within one day of inoculating (Weaver, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>According to Leath (1985), clovers are afflicted with several diseases, including: (1) internal breakdown, a physiogenic disease that involves the deterioration of pith in the upper crown region; (2) 15 major diseases caused by fungal pathogens or complexes thereof; and (3) 15 diseases of minor importance, including those caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens. Barnett and Diachun (1985) list 19 classes of virus that affect clovers.<P> Murphy et al.  (1976) detailed several important diseases of clovers.  The causal agents of damping-off disease are the common soil-borne fungi <I>Pythium</I></B> spp.  These usually attack young plants below the soil line, invade plant cells, and kill seedlings rapidly.  Seed treatment does not protect small-seeded legumes; varietial and specific susceptibility varies.<P> <I>Sclerotinia</I></B>, a soil-borne fungal pathogen commonly termed water mold, leads to the appearance of dead, watery vegetation in scattered spots about 6 inches in diameter.  This mainly occurs from late February through early April and is most severe in rank, ungrazed fields.  The spots rapidly increase in size to several feet in diameter.  A dense white mycelial web covers the dying clover.  Within 10 days, small hard, black sclerotia (lumps of mycelium) appear on the soil surface.  These look like large, irregularly shaped subclover seeds but are soft enough to cut open with a thumbnail and are white inside.  With drying weather the disease disappears.  A wide range of legumes is affected; treatment is impractical (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Pepper spot (causal agent the fungus <I>Pseudoplea trifolii</I></B>) is common on clovers during February and March.  Symptoms include black spots on leaflets and petioles.  Severe infection causes the leaves to turn yellow, then brown, and the dead tissue is dotted with tiny black fruiting bodies of the fungus (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Field mice, kangaroo rats, and birds may deplete clover seed, threatening stand maintenance.  Broadcast seeding without subsequent incorporation exposes seed to these seminivorous pests. Gophers and ground squirrels also destroy established plants. Trapping and baiting are sometimes worthwhile, but control of birds and insects is generally not possible (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>For most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp., growth is limited to the cool part of the year; species that behave as perennials in the northern United States may behave as winter annuals in the Southeast (Taylor, 1985).  Cold, foggy midwinter conditions do not favor growth of clovers, and they often appear unthrifty during such periods (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seed clovers using an alfalfa drill or disk to prepare seedbed, broadcast seed, and use cultipacker or ringroller to incorporate seed (Bugg, pers. comm.).  As recounted by Murphy et al.  (1976), soil cover reduces depredations by birds and rodents, provides better moisture for imbibition and seedling development, and by reducing exposure to heat and sunlight ensures better survival of the rhizobia with which the seed may have been inoculated. Preceding crops of sudan grass or grain can reduce competition from weedy annual plants, and provides a firm seedbed.  Clover seed can be sown directly into the stubble, with no further seedbed preparation and covered by using a ringroller. Alternatively, light disking can be used to cover seed.  If the seed is not drilled, a roller or some type of drag should be used to cover the seed with soil.  Where tillage is not feasible, a rangeland drill may be used (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Clover seed should be placed no more that 1/2 in deep because seeds are small and seedlings will be unable to reach the soil surface for development if buried too deeply.  Smooth, firm seedbeds, with few large clods, can assist in maintaining uniformly shallow seeding (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Seeding by early October, even into dry soil, leads to better establishment than November seedings.  Cold reduces growth, and frost heave can push small clover plants out of the ground. Clovers compete best if they start growing simultaneously with resident annual plants (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>The first year following seeding is critical for a clover stand. The stand should produce abundant seed to ensure perpetuation of the stand.  Weed competition can be reduced through good seedbed preparation (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Murphy et al.  (1976), fertilization at planting time should depend on the previous history of the field and the available soil phosphorus.  The latter can be determined in a commercial soil-testing laboratory by the sodium bicarbonate-extraction soil test.  If the field has not been previously fertilized or the phosphorus is less than 5 ppm, apply about 500 pounds single superphosphate per acre, to supply both phosphorus and readily available sulfur.  Where soil tests show more than 5 ppm phosphorus, less fertilizer may be used. Additional nitrogen increases competition from grass species in newly-seeded pastures and reduces nitrogen fixation.<P> Many grasslands show phosphorus deficiencies.  Clover plants growing without sufficient phosphorus are small, with small, dark-green leaves.  Soil phosphorus levels are rated as very low (5 ppm); low (5 to 10 ppm); intermediate (10 to 20 ppm); and high (over 20 ppm).  Based on those ratings, fertilizer should be applied as follows:<P>

<PRE>
  Available Soil P     Amt. Single Superphosphate
  (ppm)                or Equivalent (lb/A)
  Less than 5          500 every third year
  5-10                 250 every third year
  10 or over           100 every second year
</PRE>

 After two or three heavy applications on low-phosphorus soils, only maintenance amounts should be required.  If soil phosphorus is high, light applications every second year increase clover production by replacing phosphorus and sulfur removed by grazing (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Single superphosphate also supplies sufficient sulfur (about 12%) except where rainfall is greater than 30 inches.  In wet areas, apply about 50 lbs/acre of sulfur in alternate years.  If a high percentage of the sulfur will not pass through a 50-mesh screen, use from 100 to 200 lbs/acre.  The larger particles will last longer.  After the first year, the clover can be more heavily grazed if the soil phosphorus and sulfur supplies are adequate (Murphy et.  al, 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Grazing keeps the faster-growing weeds and grasses from overtopping clover. Ideally, a new field should be kept grazed to about 3 inches until seed heads appear on the annual grasses. Thereafter, livestock feed selectively on clovers and should be removed from the range until clover seeds have matured (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Clovers do better in short pasture (3 to 6 inches), whereas grasses do better if the forage is at 6 to 12 inches.  If clover, especially subclover, is permitted to grow dense and rank, the shaded, lower leaves die and rot before they are eaten (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>In the United States, most seed for <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  is produced in the Northwest (Taylor, 1985).  Flowering and seed production may be reduced by ungrazed, rank growth (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Established clover does best when closely, continually grazed; this practice reduces rank growth and limits the number of foxtail and other grasses which can increase as soil N increases under clover (Murphy et al., 1976).  Proper grazing and fertilization ensure self-perpetuating stands of adapted clovers. Clover pasture can be rotated with two successive crops of cereal grain or hay and then reseeded to clovers (Murphy et al.  1976).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Clover above-ground dry biomass yields reported by Bugg et al. (unpublished data) in Hopland, Mendocino County, during May following October seeding were (mean +/- S.E.M., Mg/ha): Berseem Clover ('Bigbee') 8.463+/-0.803; Crimson Clover ('Flame') 8.456+/- 1.477; Rose Clover ('Hykon') 6.153+/-1.672; 'Koala' Subclover, 9.663+/-1.605; 'Mt.  Barker' Subclover 7.628+/-0.988; 'Seaton Park' Subclover 6.814+/-0.378; 'Dalkeith' Subclover 5.134+/-1.842; 'Trikkala' Subclover 8.281+/-1.371; Strawberry Clover ('Salina') 1.866+/-0.607; and White + Strawberry Clovers 3.941+/-0.872. Moraes et al.  (1989) assessed dry matter yield, crude protein percentage, and in vitro dry and organic matter digestibilities for the native Brazilian clovers <I>Trifolium riograndense</I></B> Burkart (autotetraploid and diploid forms) and <I>T. polymorphum</I></B> Poir. were compared with white clover (<I>T. repens</I></B> L.) cultivars 'BR-1-Bage', 'Regal', 'Jacul', and 'Gualba.' The new varieties of white clover appeared promising. The native clovers showed low dry matter yield, but good quality, and appeared not to be cyanogenic.<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium</I></B> (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  inhabit the temperate regions of the world; some are native to North America, but most of agricultural interest were introduced from Europe.  From sixty to 65 species of <I>Trifolium</I></B> are from the American center of diversity, 150-160 from the Eurasian, and 25-30 from the African (south of the Sahara) (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>For most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp., growth is limited to the cool part of the year; species that perform as perennials in the northern United States may behave as winter annuals in the Southeast (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  will grow on a wide range of soil types (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>All <I>Trifolium</I></B> possess the typical papilionaceous legume flower with ten stamens; leaves usually comprise three leaflets, but a few species have five leaflets per leaf (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  have simple taproots; some also have stolons or rhizomes that extend the life of the plant.  The heavy root systems of clovers improve soil tilth and life, increase water-holding capacity, and deepen the soil to enhance drainage (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Many <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.  are useful honey plants (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Clovers (Taylor, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The genus <I>Trifolium</I></B> contains about 240 species (Gillett, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>According to the review by Gillett (1985), Musil (1963) wrote a descriptive key to seeds of 32 clover spp., including 9 of agricultural importantance. Gillett (1985) wrote that color of seed can vary with maturity, and size and shape of seed can vary, with variability in the latter based on crowding.  The hilum has not been a useful structure upon which to base taxonomic distinctions. Seed size, shape, and color are the most useful characters.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>The attitude of the radical and its length relative to the cotyledons are useful taxonomic characters in distinguishing among <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. (Gillett, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>According to Taylor (1985), <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. inhabit temperate regions of the world and require a cool, moist climate, or their growth is confined to seasons where such weather conditions prevail.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Clover rhizobia require a soil pH of greater than 5.0 but usually less than 10.5 (Burton, 1985).  Clover growth is best in the soil pH range of 6.0-7.0 (Blue and Carlisle, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Kendall and Stringer (1985) reported that competition for sunlight is a major aspect in both intraspecific and interspecific dynamics, leading to domination of stands by clovers that express rapid regrowth or tall stature.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Burton's (1985) review indicated that whereas some strains of <I>Rhizobium trifolii</I></B> tolerated salinity, others did not. Kendall and Stringer (1985) wrote that most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. do not grow in highly saline soils, and often are more adversely affected than are grasses.  Berseem, rose, and some varieties of subterranean and strawberry clovers are moderately tolerant of salintiy.  Alsike, red, white dutch, and ladino clovers are said to show low tolerance.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>The following account is based on that of Lee (1985). Herbicides applied before clover is seeded include EPTC, benefin, and propham. Prophamare can be applied after seeding but before emergence. After emergence of clover seedlings, propham, chlorpropham, and pronamide can be applied.  Broadleaf weeds can be reduced in seedling stands of red or ladino clovers, dinoseb or 2,4-DB are appropriate herbicides.  In mixed stands of clovers and grasses, postemergence application to control broadleaf weeds are the only options. MCPA and amine formulations of 2,4-D are useful in mixtures of alsike, ladino, or red clovers and cereals.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates vary greatly among the <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. (Van Keuren and Hoveland, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>No generalizations are possible.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>No generalizations are possible.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>No generalizations are possible.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>No generalizations are possible.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Rincker and Rampton (1985) wrote that seed should contain less than 10% moisture if storage is to be for 1 year or longer. Moist seed lose viability rapidly.  Rodents and other pests should, of course, be excluded.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. are annual or perennial forbs; growth habit varies greatly among the various species (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Maximum height varies greatly among the various <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Most <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. can be incorporated by disking or other standard methods of incorporation.<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Harvest strategies typically represent compromises between delay to maximize yield and persistence and early harvest to maximize quality (Van Keuren and Hoveland, 1985).  Mixtures of grasses and legumes give more consistent year-around production (Van Keuren and Hoveland, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>The following account is from Bugg (pers. comm.)  The usual range of implements for managing forage and green manure crops applies.  Mowing equipment includes sickle-bar, rotary, and flail mowers.  Appropriate tillage implements include disk, spring-toot, and spike-tooth harrows as well as power spaders. Combines are used for seed harvest.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Mixtures of grasses and legumes give more consistent year-around production (Van Keuren and Hoveland, 1985).<P> Kendall and Stringer (1985) reported that competition for sunlight is a major aspect in both intraspecific and interspecific dynamics, leading to domination of stands by clovers that express rapid regrowth or tall stature.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>N contribution varies greatly among the <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.(Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Non-N nutrient contributions are poorly investigated among the <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. have widely-varying phenologies, rooting depths, water-use patterns, and drought tolerances (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Taylor (1985) wrote that forage crops like clovers protect soil from rain damage and reduce runoff, erosion, and pollution of surface waters.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No general information is available on effects on microclimate.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Clovers confer many benefits to soils.  Based on the account by Taylor (1985), the heavy root systems of clover: (1) make the soil mellow and supportive of root growth of succeeding plants; (2) enhance soil microbial life; (3) increase soil water-holding capacity; (4) reduce wind and water erosion of light soils and the baking of heavy soils; (5) increase soil permeability.  Taylor (1985) also wrote that forage crops like clovers protect soil from rain damage and reduce runoff, erosion, and pollution of surface waters.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Taylor (1985) wrote that clovers contain from 60-80% (weight/weight) digestible dry matter.  Van Keuren and Hoveland (1985) wrote that clover pasturage is beneficial for dairy and beef cattle and for horses.  Clovers can also be used for hay, silage, and soilage (Van Keuren and Hoveland, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Manglitz (1985) wrote that insect pests attacking clovers include clover leaf weevil (<I>Hypera punctata</I></B> [Fabricius]), alfalfa weevil (<I>Hypera postica</I></B> [Gyllenhal]), alfalfa caterpillar (<I>Colias eurytheme</I></B> Boisduval), green cloverworm (<I>Plathypena scabra</I></B> [Fabricius]), omnivorous leaf tier (<I>Cnephasia longana</I></B> [Haworth]), various grasshoppers and crickets, various beetles, yellow clover aphid (<I>Therioaphis trifolii</I></B> Monell), pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> [Harris]), blue alfalfa aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B> Shinji), clover aphid (<I>Nearctaphis bakeri</I></B> [Cowen]), potato leafhopper (<I>Empoasca fabae</I></B> Harris), clover leafhopper (<I>Aceratagallia sanguinolenta</I></B> [Prov.]), meadow spittlebug (<I>Philaenus spumarius</I></B> [L.]), clover root curculio (<I>Sitona hispidulus</I></B> [Fabricius]), clover root borer (<I>Hylastinus obscurus</I></B> [Marsham]), clover head caterpillar (<I>Grapholita interstinctana</I></B> [Clemens]), lesser clover leaf weevil (<I>Hypera nigrirostris</I></B> [F.]), clover head weevil (<I>Hypera meles</I></B> [F.]), clover seed weevil (<I>Tychius picirostris</I></B> [Fabricius]), clover seed midge (<I>Dasyneura legumnicola</I></B> [Lintner]), and clover seed chalcid (<I>Bruchophagus platypterus</I></B>).<P> Insects can cause periodic local damage but do not usually eliminate the legume attacked; chemical control is usually impractical.  In spring, various phytophagous mites can cause severe local damage.  Along the Sierra foothills, a small leaftier caterpillar ties the folded clover leaf together with a web and lives inside, feeding on the leaf.  Larvae of alfalfa weevil and clover leaf weevil (green, legless, and about 1/2 inch long) damage growing tips and young leaves in late spring (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Leath (1985) noted that clovers have problems with plant-parasitic nematodes, including: (1) root knot nematodes (<I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp.); (2) Root-lesion nematode (<I>Praylenchus penetrans</I></B>); (3) clover cyst nematode (<I>Heterodera trifolii</I></B>); (4) stem nematode (<I>Ditylenchus dipsaci</I></B>); (5) <I>Xiphinema</I></B>  spp.;  (6) <I>Tylenchorhyncus</I></B> spp.; and (7) <I>Paratylenchus</I></B> spp.<P>

<H1>1990 Farm Bill: Implications for California</H1>
<P>
<I>by Dave Chaney &amp; Dave Campbell SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
After much deliberation and negotiation, the 1990 Farm Bill was
finally passed by Congress late last year. It contains new and
revised provisions that may be of interest to California farmers.
 Critics argue that, like the 1985 Farm Bill, the new regulations
still favor medium to large-scale farmers, leaving small and beginning
farmers at a disadvantage.  Nonetheless, the new bill takes some
positive steps toward reducing penalties for farm diversification,
rewarding land stewardship, and establishing new agricultural
research and extension priorities.  A synopsis of the major environmental
and consumer-oriented provisions follows.<BR>
<P>
<B>State, Private Forestry:</B>  The Forest Stewardship Act of
1990 includes various incentive and assistance programs to conserve
and maintain existing forest lands.  The <I>America the Beautiful
Program </I>is established to promote tree planting.<BR>
<P>
<B>Fruits, Vegetables, Marketing:</B>  The new Farm This portion
of the Farm Bill authorizes a research program to look at the
impact of federal cosmetic grade standards on pesticide use in
producing fresh fruits and vegetables.  It also establishes new
procedures for setting cosmetic standards.  The new process will
take into account potential effects of cosmetic standards on farmers'
ability to reduce pesticide use.  It also allows the public to
give input on new or revised standards.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agricultural Trade:</B>  One of the highlights of this title
of the Farm Bill is a &quot;debt for nature&quot; swap program
aimed at Latin American and Caribbean countries.  It authorizes
a reduction of food aid debt owed to Unites States in exchange
for programs that conserve natural resources in the designated
regions.  Participating countries would enter into a specific
agreement with the United States:  Instead of repaying the U.S.
government in dollars, the country would direct interest on the
reduced debt to an Environmental Fund that could only be used
for programs that enhance the environment.<BR>
<P>
<B>Research:</B>  A new statement of purpose of the research and
extension system is set forth, that gives greater prominence 
to  sustainable  agriculture  concerns.  Among the specific goals
are &quot;expanding economic opportunities in rural America and
enhancing the quality of life for farmers, rural citizens, and
society as a whole; developing information and systems to enhance
the environment and the natural resource base upon which a sustainable
agriculture economy depends; fostering the availability and affordability
of a safe, wholesome, and nutritious food supply that meets the
needs and preferences of the consumer; assisting farmers and other
rural residents in the detection and prevention of health and
safety concerns.&quot;  (Summary of Title 16, 1990 Farm Bill)
<BR>
<P>
The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education subtitle expands
the current USDA Low-Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA) Program,
and authorizes $40 million annually for LISA-funded research.
 There is a big difference, of course, between authorization and
appropriation.  The actual increase in LISA funding is dependent
on the outcome of current negotiations in Congress.  (LISA is
also renamed BUBA, Best Utilization of Biological Applications,
although use of new name is uncertain.)<BR>
<P>
In addition to LISA, two new research programs  are authorized,
each with a $20 million funding authorization for every year 1991-1995.
 The first, <I>integrated management systems, </I>directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish research and dissemination
of information related to farming operations, practices, and systems
that improve crop and livestock production that are environmentally
sound.  The second, <I>sustainable agriculture technology development
and transfer programs, </I>requires that technical guides, handbooks,
and other materials be written to help farmers develop more sustainable
farming systems. Included in the authorization are funds for direct
training of extension agents and other professionals at regional
training centers devoted to sustainable agriculture methods. 
No funds have been appropriated for these programs so far.<BR>
<P>
<B>Organic Certification:</B>  This new title establishes a program
to develop national standards governing the production, processing
and labeling of organically produced food.  It will be funded
mainly through user fees paid by organic farmers and certifying
agents, and will fall under the administration of the USDA. Farmers
and processors who want to use an organic label for their products
after October 1, 1993 must have their operation certified organic
by a state or private certifying agent accredited by the USDA:
 They will also have to comply with the organic standards developed
by the new National Organic Standards Board.  The basis for these
standards will be a list of approved substances and compounds
for use by organic farmers.  National standards will not preempt
stricter state organic programs.<BR>
<P>
<B>Commodity Programs:</B>  A major revision to the general commodity
programs (cotton, wheat, corn, rice) is that land idled under
the set-aside (acreage reduction) programs should be planted to
an annual or perennial cover crop.  A farmer participating in
the acreage reduction program is required to plant a cover crop
on at least half of the set-aside acres (but not more than five
percent of the acreage base) established for that crop.  This
requirement does not apply to arid, summer-fallow areas where
cover crops could deplete soil moisture needed for crop production.
 Cost-share assistance is available to farmers who establish a
perennial cover crop (multi-year set-aside) for the purposes of
improving water quality or wildlife habitat.<BR>
<P>
Other related sections increase farmers' flexibility to diversity
their normal rotations and plant other non-program crops.  For
example, the 1990 Farm Bill permits  farmers  to  plant  and 
harvest  specified non-program crops on the acreage base established
for a  program  commodity  without  reducing  that commodity's
acreage base.  A planting limit of 25<I> </I>percent of the acreage
base is being recommended. Alternate crops could include oilseed,
industrial or experimental crops.<BR>
<P>
<B>Conservation:</B>  This section of the Farm Bill contains numerous
subtitles and chapters related to sustainable agriculture.  Major
components of the conservation title include:  Highly erodible
land and wetland conservation; agricultural water quality incentives;
programs for environmental easement, watershed protection, flood
control, integrated farm management, resource conservation, Great
Plains Conservation, state water quality coordination;  administration
 of  environmental programs; Agricultural Council on Environmental
Quality; water quality research, education and coordination; water
quality and nutrient management research; and pesticide record
keeping.<BR>
<P>
Some of the most significant progress toward more sustainable
farming practices is found in the new Integrated Farm Management
Program Option (IFMPO).  Under the IFMPO, farmers will be eligible
to receive program payments for resource-conserving (non-pro-gram)
crops planted on a portion of the base acres.  Different from
commodity provision planting flexibility noted above, this option
also allows some harvesting on set-aside acres.  According to
the law, resource-conserving crops include:  forage legumes, any
legume grown for forage or green manure, legume/small grain mixtures,
 legume/grass  mixtures,  and  legume/grass/small grain mixtures.
 Benefits of the program are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The commodity acreage base will not be reduced when a resource-conserving
crop is planted on base acres.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Program payment yields cannot be reduced even if a temporary
yield decline results during the transition to a new cropping
system.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Deficiency payments will be made on resource-con-serving crops
as if the program crop had been planted.  Restrictions on haying
or grazing the resource-conserving crop apply.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Farmers may hay or graze a resource-conserving crop on 50<I>
</I>percent of set-aside acres, without restriction. Non-program
small grains (e.g. buckwheat, rye, triticale) interplanted with
legumes may also be harvested for grain on these set-aside acres.
 Alternatively, cover crops grown for seed may be planted.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
Since the specific rules and regulations governing the different
commodity and cost-share programs are still being hammered out,
contact your local office of the USDA Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) or Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS)
for details about signing up and compliance.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Keynote speech given at the Second International
Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition, Arlington, Virginia, June 29,
1992.<BR>
<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
In recent years, ethical and environmental concerns about eating
meat have merged in the effort to achieve public reform. This
paper focuses on the environmental issue: Does the optimal relationship
between humans and the environment include or exclude animals
as food? This question is addressed in three parts: 1) the popular
development of the idea that environmental responsibility is linked
to vegetarianism, 2) the destructive effects of present methods
of animal raising on farmers, animal welfare, and the environment,
and finally 3) asking whether vegetarianism is the appropriate
response to these problems: &quot;Is universal vegetarianism the
goal?&quot;<BR>

<H3><B>The Origins of the Vegetarianism-Environmental Link</B>
</H3>

<P>
The public first became widely conscious of the problems of modern
animal raising in the United States about 20 years ago when Ballantine
Books published Francis Moore Lappe's <I>Diet for a Small Planet,
</I>which sold over two million copies in ten years. Lappe presented
evidence that agricultural resources were being wasted and the
planet degraded to satisfy the U.S. hunger for grain-fed beef.
Further, she postulated that this meat-based diet is one cause
of world hunger and that vegetarianism is kinder to the planet.
<BR>

<P>
Many of the same problems first articulated by Lappe have been
more recently documented by John Robbins in <I>Diet for a New
America </I>and Jeremy Rifkin in <I>Beyond Beef. </I>Rifkin implies
in his book that giving up beef will resolve many of the world's
social and environmental problems, and that nature will recover.
Although the notion that &quot;nature can restore what a troubling
culture has destroyed&quot; is implicit in Rifkin's and many others'
logic, Gussow points out that this notion is unrealistic given
millennia of human intervention. In fact, leaving nature alone
now may not result in the natural succession of plant and animal
species as Rifkin suggests, but instead, in a takeover by weeds
from surrounding territories. Thus, Gussow concludes that &quot;leaving
nature alone in a world already deeply affected by humans is a
practical impossibility.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Ruth Harrison's <I>Animal Machines </I>published in Britain in
1964 was one of the first popular books deliberately drawing public
attention to the ethics of modern animal raising. As with crop
production, the aim of animal agriculture has become efficiency:
how to produce more animal or animal product in less time and
with the least labor. To meet this goal, industry established
large, confined animal facilities, a trend that has continued
to the present.<BR>

<H3><B>The Ecological Desirability of Vegetarianism</B></H3>

<P>
Our present livestock production system relies largely on feed
grain. (Thirty-eight percent of the world's grain production is
used for livestock feed.) Although land used for feed grain would
probably not be used to feed the poor in rich countries, this
is not true in developing countries. To satisfy a growing demand
for animal products, feed grains must be imported or grown at
the expense of traditional food crops which may then have to be
imported, all of which reduces a nation's self-reliance. In addition,
feed grain is often grown in monocropped systems, which can degrade
topsoil and use excessive energy. Production of livestock in confined
systems also concentrates large quantities of manure in one place,
which has become a major management problem in recent years.<BR>

<P>
Even livestock that are not raised intensively are creating worldwide
environmental stresses due to their increasing numbers. &quot;World
meat production has nearly quadrupled since 1950 as the populations
of affluent countries and the newly affluent of poor countries,
increased their intake of meat.&quot; This has led to overstocking
of pastures, degradation of grazing areas and decimation of forestlands
to make way for pastures. So, whether confined or free ranging,
domestic livestock are putting an unsustainable burden on croplands
and grazing lands around the world.  &quot;Is the solution vegetarianism?&quot;
<H3><B>Livestock and Sustainability</B></H3>

<P>
Animals are an important component of many natural and managed
ecosystems. In many parts of the world, crops and animals are
integrated within the farm system. In these areas animals may
act as a &quot;savings account&quot; for the farmer, and livestock
and their products may represent the margin between survival and
starvation. Ruminants, in particular, can produce high quality
food from grazing lands not suitable for growing crops. In addition,
livestock manure (a problem in intensive, confined systems) is
a precious fertilizer and indispensable source of fuel in much
of the world. Therefore, one important measure of sustainability,
according to Gussow, is the extent to which livestock and crop
production are integrated in farming systems. She urges that we
reestablish integrated systems where they have disappeared, and
encourage them where they survive. In range-land areas, suitable
for livestock only, sustainability would be dependent on establishing
and maintaining functional ecosystems rather than maximizing production.
<BR>

<P>
<I>Editor's note: This paper emphasizes the role livestock play
in developing regions of the world. Readers should note that livestock
also have an important place in North American agriculture, both
from an economic and ecological standpoint. Integration takes
place at a different level in North American agriculture (i.e.,
between farms within a region), but the cycling and exchange of
resources and nutrients between the systems is still an important
consideration.</I>
<H3><B>Conclusion</B></H3>

<P>
Finally, Gussow raises the larger question of who is in control
of the food system. She states: &quot;The issue then is not beef,
and not the consumption of animals <I>per se, </I>but the ways
in which the human species misuses nature for profit in the name
of producing food...What drives the food system is not human appetite,
but profit.&quot; Gussow asserts that the real problem we face
is one of scale and control. &quot;Giant corporations that are
rapidly gaining control over the world's food from seed to table
are working to create a system from which nature is largely excluded.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
We are all responsible for thinking about and participating in
the decisions about how the world's resources are used. On a global
scale, vegetarianism may actually be unecological. Eliminating
animals in the many integrated systems around the world that are
producing food for human consumption would decrease both sustainability
and food output. These systems need to be nourished as part of
a diversified ecosystem that will be required for long-term sustainability.
Animals and their products have a vital role in that system.<BR>

<H1>Training Courses Move Small Farmers Out on Their Own</H1>
<P>
<I>by Dave Chaney, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
A field day July 12 at the Rural Development Center (RDC) in the
Salinas Valley spotlighted a unique program that gives small farmers'
technical assistance and land, and also fosters a partnership
between the farmers and the researchers who aid them. The researchers
use the farmers' needs as the basis for on-farm field experiments.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mike Gonzalez</B>, RDC agronomist, explained that the goal
of many California farmworkers is to operate their own farm business.
He noted that producing and marketing one's own crop allows farmers
to establish their own schedules and working conditions, and may
provide a unique opportunity for the farm family to work together
for economic self-sufficiency. The 115 acre RDC, a project of
the Association for Community Based Education of Washington, D.C.,
provides the land and administration for the program, while funding
for the research and demonstration projects at the site comes
from many sources, including the California Energy Commission
and Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation.<BR>
<P>
Small farmers apply for the opportunity to participate in the
RDC program. The RDC provides land, training and technical assistance
over a three-year period for those selected; other inputs are
purchased by the farmers themselves. Participants build agricultural
and business-related skills as they plant, care for, harvest and
market their own crops, Gonzalez said. By the end of their third
year, participating farmers have gained self-esteem as well as
the training and experience required to either go into business
for themselves or to move on to other more advanced farm-related
employment, he said.<BR>
<P>
About 50 farm families from Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz
counties have participated in the first four years of the RDC
on-site program. Gonzalez said many other small farmers in the
region have received RDC support off-site.<BR>
<P>
Weekly workshops are an important component of the RDC training
program, Gonzalez said. Courses are offered on a variety of topics
including new and specialty crops, farm finance, marketing, irrigation,
vegetable cropping, compost, and farm equipment. They are supported
by a UC Cooperative Extension grant and special assistance from
the UC Small Farm Center. RDC staff work closely with the participating
farmers to identify information needs and priority topics.
<P>
<B>Paul Gersper</B>, UC Berkeley soil science associate professor
and RDC workshop coordinator, said the contribution of Cooperative
Extension staff time has been an invaluable resource. Farm advisors
<B>Richard Smith</B>, San Benito County, and <B>Harry Agamalian</B>
and <B>John Inman</B>, Monterey County, and many other county
and campus-based experts throughout the state have conducted courses.
<BR>
<P>
As part of the RDC training program, several research projects
are being conducted to meet specific information needs of small-scale
farmers in the Salinas Valley. Many small farmers in this area
combine traditional Hispanic approaches to agriculture with their
experience working on conventional vegetable farms in California,
according to Gonzalez. He said the aim of the research projects
is to improve these practices to develop energy-saving vegetable
cropping systems that are also culturally acceptable.<BR>
<P>
At the field day Associate Professor <B>Miguel Altieri</B>, UC
Berkeley Division of Biological Control, emphasized the participatory
nature of the RDC research program. Altieri said it is essential
for research to begin with the small farmer's actual circumstances.
After evaluating the farmer's practices, a list of constraints
and limitations can be drawn up. Altieri said low-input management
practices are then proposed to reach a desired benefit. The proposed
low-input practices in turn become the basis for on-farm field
experiments. For instance, it is common for Mexican farmers to
plant polycultures of zucchini and tomato.  Though the polyculture
offers farmers several advantages (e.g., enhanced biological pest
management and spreading of economic risk), these systems tend
to have low marketable yields. To address these constraints and
improve the overall energy efficiency of the system, Altieri and
Gersper, along with<B> Javier Trujillo</B>, UC Berkeley entomology,
and <B>Marta Astier</B> and <B>Will Bakx</B>, UC Berkeley soil
science, have been researching the possibility of using compost
and cover crops in the zucchini-tomato polyculture.  From yield
data, insect monitoring, and soil sampling over the past year
they were able to draw several conclusions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Tomatoes grown with compost had higher yields than the unfertilized
control regardless of the cropping design or the cover crop used;
on the other hand, zucchini showed very little response to compost
compared with the control.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>At mid-season, populations of the green aphid were higher
in tomato monoculture than in the tomato-zucchini polyculture;
there were no significant differences at other times during the
growing season.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>By the end of the growing season, the zucchini monoculture
had higher populations of the convergent ladybeetle than did the
zucchini-tomato polyculture.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The zucchini-tomato polyculture used resources more efficiently
than did the monoculture of each crop. This was indicated by a
land equivalent ratio of 1.48. This means that 1.48 acres would
be needed to produce in monoculture the amount of zucchini and
tomato that was harvested in one acre of polyculture.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
A demonstration project is planned in the next year to test these
results further. Throughout the field day, researchers stressed
that their projects are developed and conducted in conjunction
with farmers. In the case of the compost/cover crop experiment,
replicated plots laid out and managed by researchers were planted
next to farmers' fields. In their own fields, farmers managed
simpler, one-treatment experiments (e.g., compost vs. no compost)
as part of their everyday activities. This participatory approach
enhances the relevancy of the project and makes the extension/education
component more effective, Gonzalez said.<BR>

<H1>A no-tillage tomato production system using hairy vetch and
subterranean Clover mulches.</H1>

<P>
This article describes a no-tillage vegetable production system
that uses winter annual legumes as both cover crop and plant mulch.
 According to the authors, this production system is adapted to
both large- and small-scale operations. It takes advantage of
the benefits that legumes offer, and avoids the difficulties of
spreading a mulch uniformly over a field.
<P>
The experiment was conducted at the Beltsville, Maryland Research
Center.  The researchers looked at the effects of the no-tillage
system on yield and earliness of fresh market 'Sunny' tomato.
 Tomatoes following cover crops of hairy vetch and 'Mt. Barker'
subterranean clover were compared to those grown under conventional
tillage using black polyethylene mulch, Horto paper mulch, and
no mulch.
<P>
In the cover crop treatments, beds were prepared immediately before
sowing of the cover crops.  Clover seed was planted on September
5 at a rate of 28 kg per ha; vetch seed was planted on September
18 at a rate of 53 kg per ha.  The cover crops were not irrigated
and were grown without any other treatment until they were mowed
the following spring.  In early May, after determinations were
made of cover crop growth, the clover and vetch plots were mowed
to about 4 cm above the soil surface using a high-speed flail
mower.  This operation chopped the plants and spread them uniformly
over the beds.  Five-week-old tomato seedlings were planted through
the mulch layer on May 1 (early planting date) and May 8 (optimum
planting date).  A 7-cm hole was cut through the mulch using a
tree planter and then tomatoes were transplanted by hand causing
minimal disturbance to the mulch.  Trickle irrigation lines were
laid over the cut mulch surface 10 cm away from the plants and
fixed in position with U- shaped wires.  Tomatoes were planted
in the comparative systems on the same two dates (May 1 and 8).
<P>
The poly mulch, paper mulch and bare soil treatments were irrigated
weekly through the drip lines with a 9-6.6-24.9 NPK solution.
 Cover crop/mulch treatments were fertilized every other week
using the same solution.  Weeds were controlled as needed in all
treatments using herbicides.

The effect of the various treatments on tomato yield is shown
in table 1. Total tomato yield in the hairy vetch mulch was more
than double the yield of the control (nonmulched) plants, and
significantly higher for both planting dates than yield from the
black polyethylene-mulched plants.  The authors attributed the
success of the vetch over the clover treatment to its superior
winter hardiness in the Beltsville area.  &quot;The clover stand
was killed on top of beds in winter but produced 3.6 tons per
ha of dry matter in the troughs between rows.  In contrast, the
hairy vetch stand was well established on the beds, and the plants
were about I meter long at mowing time, with 3.8 tons per ha above
ground dry matter.&quot;
<P>
In terms of earliness, black polyethylene mulch was superior to
all other mulches in enhancing yield.  The effects of black polyethylene
mulch in warming soil and promoting plant growth have been well-established.
<P>
The authors suggest that the vetch mulch offers a number of benefits
in this production system.  First, mowing and spreading the cover
crop provides a thick layer of mulch that reduces soil erosion
and soil water evaporation, and that moderates soil temperature.
 The mulch also eliminates early weed competition (later weed
emergence or cover crop regrowth can be controlled with postemergence
herbicides.) The authors also conclude that the cover crop residue
on the soil surface sustains nitrogen decomposition and release
over a longer period than if the cover crop were plowed in.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
The authors have produced a pamphlet for growers that describes
this production system in more detail.  The title is <I>Sustainable
Production of Fresh-Market Tomatoes with Organic Mulches, </I>published
by the United States Department of Agriculture, 1994, Farmers'
Bulletin FB-2279.  Contact Abdul-Baki for information about how
to order the pamphlet (see address below).
<P>
Adapting the no-till mulch production system to California conditions
will require careful management on the part of growers.  Major
considerations include: 1) the choice of cover crop; 2) the effect
of the mulch on soil insect pests; 3) the tendency of the mulch
to keep the soil cool in the spring; 4) the time of mowing as
it relates to conservation of soil water; and 5) the relative
costs and benefits of other types 'of mulches.

Systems</I>, 1993 (V93-V), produced by <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A>,</B> UC
SAREP. Cover cropping is a key tool in sustainable agriculture,
and is especially useful in orchards and vineyards. The video
covering perennial farming systems explains how to use cover crops
to protect and improve soil fertility, enhance pest control, and
provide other benefits. Cover cropping presents special challenges
when used with annual row and field crops. The annual cover crop
video depicts both opportunities and constraints in using cover
crops with annual crops. Both videos present a wide array of plant
materials and management options. The videos are $20 each (VHS
format, includes postage, handling and applicable taxes). Checks
should be made payable to UC Regents. Checks, VISA or MasterCard
payment should be sent to UC Visual Media, University of California,

<H1>The death of Rarnon Gonzalez: The modern agriculture dilemma.
</H1>
<P>
<I>Wright, Angus</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>University of Texas Press. 1990<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Angus Wright's carefully documented book about agriculture in
modern Mexico weaves together field observations, personal interviews,
and scholarly reports to raise fundamental questions about the
use and abuse of pesticides.  Wright is professor of environmental
studies at California State University, Sacramento.  He went to
Mexico seeking to understand why pesticide poisonings of migrant
workers have become so common, and what could be done to prevent
them.  He left convinced that pesticide abuse is rooted in unjust
social conditions stemming from regional inequities introduced
into rural Mexico by the Green Revolution.<BR>
<P>
The book's centerpiece is the story of how the Culiacan Valley
in northwest Mexico was transformed from a quiet rural hamlet
into a center of pesticide-intensive agriculture devoted to exporting
vegetables to the United States.  Wright shows how Culiacan's
new wealth was purchased at the cost of the environmental and
economic decline of traditional agriculture in the Mixtec region
of Oaxaca, and the exploitation of the workers who fled that region
in desperation to seek out work in Culiacan's fields.<BR>
<P>
Many parts of this story have been told before, but Wright weaves
them together into a complex, coherent picture which links technical
concerns about pesticide practices to their cultural and political
context.  For example, Wright documents the recent trend toward
greater use of &quot;nonpersistent pesticides,&quot; chemicals
which leave few lasting residues in food or the environment, but
are still dangerous upon immediate exposure in the field.  He
notes that this shift has weakened the political linkages between
farm workers and consumers.  As he puts it, &quot;The precise
degree of linkage between consumer interests, environmental interests,
and the interests of farm workers and rural residents is not a
given but rather changes as the technology of pesticides changes,
severely complicating judgements about what constitutes safe pesticides&quot;
(p.202).<BR>
<P>
A key theme of the book is that the problems inherent in modern
agricultural production are primarily political; &quot;not the
obstacles thrown up by cruel nature, but adversities created by
unresolved human conflict&quot; (p.285).  Solving pesticide problems
will thus require comprehensive political changes rather than
simple campaigns to educate workers and growers:<BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;The problem is that ignorance and unregulated promotion
of dangerous technologies are intimately tied to the political
relationships and the ideological assumptions that determine how
a nation is ruled.  Abusive use of pesticides is usually the result
of a whole set of problems that indicate the loyalties and purposes
of the people and groups who hold power.  The problem of tens
of thousands of acres of fine farmland given over to large-scale
commercial production of crops through abusive use of pesticides
by millionaire farmers is strongly related to the continued powerlessness
of peasants and farm workers and their relative ignorance of the
safeguards needed in applying modern technologies.  This situation
is in turn related to much broader political and economic issues
involving a nation's relationship with the rest of the world.
 The fact that 70% of the pesticides used in the Third World are
used on products for export to wealthy nations expresses the strong
connection of pesticide abuse to the particular kind of relationship
that predominates between rich and poor countries.  In addition,
the Mixtec farm workers who tie Culiacan to the collapsing traditional
regions in Mexico also tie Mexico to California, Texas, Arizona
and force us to ask how the unequal development of Mexico will
affect the future of the United States&quot; (pp.217-18).<BR>
</I>
<P>
Wright's point of departure is the death of a young Mixtec named
Ramon Gonzalez (the name was fictionalized for the study) while
picking tomatoes as a migrant laborer in the Culiacan Valley.
 Though definitive evidence is hard to come by, the cause of his
death was most likely pesticide poisoning.  Like the overwhelming
majority of workers Wright observed, Ramon worked in close contact
with dangerous chemicals without having been provided with any
of the recommended safety equipment.  In addition, he had to bathe
in an irrigation ditch that contained pesticide residues.  Wright's
pursuit of these details soon led him to broader inquiry into
how the logic of agricultural development in Mexico led Ramon
to be working under such dangerous conditions.<BR>
<P>
The family of Ramon Gonzalez was from Oaxaca in southern Mexico,
a Mixtec region whose culture runs back over a thousand years.
 Drawing on first-hand observations, Wright offers a sympathetic
portrait of this region and its people.  He describes in detail
their tradition of subsistence agriculture and the cultural underpinnings
of that tradition.  Over the centuries the Mixtec emphasis on
economic security and community solidarity has come into conflict
with the alternative values and practices of various ruling elites
in Mexico.  As Wright succinctly puts it, &quot;Peasants dream
of relatively autonomous rural communities within what is presumed
to be a closed natural system.  Elites dream of greater consumption,
growth, and monumental undertakings&quot; (p.186).<BR>
<P>
During the 1940s, these competing world views clashed when Avila
Camacho replaced Lazaro Cardenas as President.  Cardenas had instituted
policies that strengthened rural regions by redistributing land
to peasants, while Camacho instituted new policies to boost agricultural
productivity via exports.  Camacho invited Rockefeller Foundation
scientists into the country, and the Green Revolution was born.
 Wright characterizes the results:<BR>
<P>
<I>&quot;If the drive for industrialization creates severe regional
inequalities, more damage is done.  This is especially clear in
the case that is the centerpiece of this book-the brutal exploitation
of the poverty and environmental ruin of one region to promote
reckless, environmentally destructive growth in another-the relationship
that ties Culiacan to the Mixteca.  The problems of the poorer
region deepen, and the very cheapness and abundance of labor flowing
out of the poor region encourage a cavalier attitude toward the
health and loyalty of workers.  Because workers are abundant and
desperate, they are considered expendable.&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
Wright demonstrates how the narrow technical perspective of Green
Revolution scientists contributed directly to the plan's social
and environmental failures.  Many of these failures were predicted
by early critics of the plan who had a greater understanding of
Mexico's history, culture and politics.  Wright's review of this
history makes a powerful case for why a systems approach to agricultural
development is needed.<BR>
<P>
Wright believes that the logic of agricultural modernization in
Mexico, and its dependence on pesticides, is technically and politically
self-defeating.  Created to boost industrialization and create
a wealthier and healthier society, the modernization program has
instead enriched a few rich producers while undermining the environmental
and social health of the majority.  The drain of rising health
and welfare expenses, and social pressures resulting from massive
migration into the cities, stand in the way of further economic
progress.  At the same time, persistent problems with pest resistance
and declining soil quality make it doubtful that current levels
of agricultural production can be maintained.<BR>
<P>
The root problems, says the author are flawed assumptions about
the role of agriculture in making a nation prosperous.  Wright
concludes by raising five questions which are as relevant to California
agriculture as to Mexico: &quot;Is productivity the problem? 
Are traditional technologies an obstacle or a resource?  Should
agriculture serve as the instrument for industrialization?  Is
agriculture vitally linked to wild nature?  Are technologies neutral?&quot;
 His answers will not be shared by all readers, but are grounded
in arguments that cannot be ignored.<BR>
<P>
Wright's story helps illuminate the powerful social and political
forces that compel increasing numbers of Mexicans to become migrant
laborers here in California.  It is estimated that between 30-40%
of the agricultural workforce in the San Joaquin Valley are Mixtec
(see <I>Components </I>1(4):10-11).  Wright admires the capacity
of the Mixtecs to band together to preserve their culture against
overwhelming odds, and sees in this capacity a cultural building-block
for creating a more sustainable agriculture:  &quot;I came to
believe that the amazing capacity of many of Mexico's poorest
people for sustained effort in a single direction and for solidarity
among themselves under trying circumstances could together be
a significant force toward a healthier society and a more sustainable
agriculture.  But those people will need allies&quot; (p. xv).

This review (32 references) looks at the use of pesticides and
fertilizers worldwide, as well as the energy required to produce,
package, transport, and apply them. In 1972, agriculture used
about 3.5 percent of the world's commercial energy; this figure
was generally lower for developed countries. Of the total energy
used in agriculture, about 51 percent was used for farm machinery
operation and manufacture, 45 percent was invested in chemical
fertilizers (mostly nitrogen), and only 2 percent went to production
and application of pesticides. Although the total amount of energy
used for pesticides is small, on a per unit weight basis more
energy is used in the production of pesticides than any other
agricultural input. On average, production of pesticides takes
four to five times more energy per pound than nitrogen fertilizer
production.  <BR>

<P>
Table 1 shows the overall world average of energy required for
production, packaging, transportation, and application of nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizers. In the last decade,
the production process has been made slightly more energy-efficient.
Nitrogen requires the largest energy input for production. In
1983-84 74.5 million short tons of nitrogen were produced in the
world, requiring the equivalent of about 32 billion gallons of
diesel fuel. When packaging, transportation, and application are
added in, the equivalent of 36 billion gallons (about 650 million
barrels) of diesel fuel were used to supply nitrogen to the world's
farms.  <BR>

<P>
The author also assigned energy values to organic sources of nutrients.
Based on the average amounts of NPK contained in a material, he
calculated the energy equivalent it would take to produce the
same amount of nutrients as chemical fertilizer. To replace the
nutrients contained in a ton of beef manure (4.4% N) or sewage
sludge (4.0% N) would require over 1300 BTUs (equivalent to less
than 0.01 gallon of fuel); for crop residues (1.1% N) and municipal
refuse (0.70% N), the value would be less than 500 BTUs per ton.
These energy figures provide further evidence that &quot;wastes&quot;
(usually viewed as a liability or disposal problem) may actually
be an important resource for agriculture. In addition to providing
some nutrients, organic materials also have value in terms of
their effect on soil structure. <I>(Reviewer's note: There is
an energy cost to handling, transporting, and applying organic
materials; this cost is not accounted for by the author.) <BR>
</I>
<P>
Another organic source of nutrients, biological nitrogen fixation
by legumes, produces about 88 million tons of nitrogen each year
for agriculture, compared. with chemical nitrogen fertilizer production
of about 55 million tons. The amount of energy used to fix the
legume nitrogen was nearly four times that used to make chemical
nitrogen fertilizer. It is important to note, however, that the
source of energy for nitrogen fixation is sunlight, not natural
gas as is the case for chemical fertilizers.  <BR>

<H3>Pesticides<BR>
</H3>

<P>
In 1984, the equivalent of over $16 billion was spent on pesticides
worldwide. Over half of this money was spent on herbicides, and
the U.S. contributed to nearly half the world's expenditures on
herbicides-primarily on corn and soybeans. Herbicides were the
major type of pesticide used in all countries except for some
Central American and Asian countries where insecticides were predominantly
applied. The U.S. spent one-third of all pesticide dollars, using
more than three times as much pesticide as any other country.
Japan and France ranked second and third, respectively.  <BR>

<P>
Pesticide manufacturing is energy-intensive. Most pesticides are
derived from ethylene and propylene, which are obtained by catalytic
cracking of crude petroleum oils, or from methane from natural
gas. Some pesticides are more energy-intensive than others (table
2), however, pesticides also vary in their energy use per unit
area of application. The trend in pesticide manufacturing is towards
production of pesticides that are more energy-intensive per unit,
but that are applied at a very low rate per acre.  <BR>

<P>
Following manufacturing <I>per se, </I>more energy (on the order
of 4,300 to 13,000 BTUs per pound of material) is required to
formulate these compounds into marketable products. Packaging,
distribution, and transport require an additional 3,000 to 15,000
BTUs per pound. <BR>

<P>
This chapter presents substantial data on energy requirements
of pesticides and fertilizers, but it lacks quantitative comparisons
to alternative systems. A valuable addition to the analysis would
be to assign energy values to specific alternative practices (e.g.,
rearing and releasing beneficial insects, crop rotation). This
information could be a valuable measure of agricultural sustainability,
especially considering the growing limitations and constraints
placed on world supplies of fossil fuels.  <BR>

<P>
Another weakness in the article is the reasoning by which the
author justifies the use of pesticides. He states that there is
a significant return (in terms of food energy) on the energy expended
to produce and apply pesticides. His primary example is that of
the yield increases obtained through the use of herbicides in
corn. The calculations, however, fail to account for the environmental
and social costs incurred beyond manufacturing and application.
Such extra costs include farmworker medical expenses, monitoring
of food for residues, pesticide container disposal, drift of pesticides
onto neighboring farms or urban areas, litigation involving pesticides,
as well as the effects of pesticides on air and water quality
and on wildlife. An accurate cost/benefit analysis of pesticides
should account for both the up-front production costs and any
hidden costs that might result from their use.   <BR>

Security. 1995<BR>

<P>
This 113-page report is the product of a year-long investigation
by researchers at the Pacific Institute, an independent, nonprofit
center with offices in Oakland, Calif. The report contains a wealth
of data on existing water use patterns and recommends changes
that would enable the state to achieve water sustainability by
the year 2020. The authors define &quot;sustainable water use&quot;
as &quot;the use of water that supports the ability of human society
to endure and flourish into the indefinite future without undermining
the integrity of the hydrological cycle or the ecological systems
that depend on it.&quot; 
<P>
In contrast to what many water analysts assume, the report asserts
that &quot;To realize this positive vision, no significant new
supply infrastructures need be built, nor are any drastic advances
in technology necessary. No 'heroic' or extraordinary actions
are required of any individual or sector.&quot; Instead, needed
changes can occur by extending existing technological innovations
and encouraging changes already taking place in personal values
and culture.
<P>
Although the report gives equal treatment to changes impacting
urban, environmental, and agricultural interests, readers of this
newsletter will be most interested in the repost's vision for
agriculture. Currently, agriculture accounts for over three-quarters
of the net societal demand for water in California, and bears
a major responsibility for the estimated annual groundwater overdraft
of one million acre-feet. Most of the overdraft is concentrated
in the Tulare Lake hydrologic study area (i.e. the southern San
Joaquin Valley), which accounts for 58 percent of the state total,
and in the Central Coast, which accounts for 28 percent.
<P>
The report asserts that with &quot;modest&quot; reorganization,
&quot;the agricultural sector can be more efficient, with lower
total water demand and higher [net] agricultural revenues.&quot;
Better managed and more efficient irrigation systems are part
of the answer, including expanding the use of drip or microsprinkler
techniques, and soil moisture sensors linked to computerized water
monitoring systems.
<P>
But the authors' major recommendations for agriculture have to
do with shifts in cropping patterns. They note that the water-intensive
crops alfalfa, cotton, rice, and irrigated pasture now consume
54 percent of all agricultural water used, yet produce only 17
percent of the state's agricultural revenue. By shifting acreage
from these to higher-value crops which use less water, &quot;agricultural
net water demand could decline by 3.5 million acre-feet while
farm income rises by $1.5 billion (in 1988 dollars).&quot;
<P>
They reach this conclusion by making projections from either of
two crop change scenarios. The first, called &quot;Balanced Groundwater,&quot;
reduces irrigated alfalfa and pasture acreage within each hydrologic
region to the point where the amount of water saved equals the
amount of groundwater overdraft projected by the Department of
Water Resources (DWR) in 2020. The second, called &quot;Agricultural
Restructuring,&quot; adds to these reductions a scaling back of
cotton and rice acreage to 1960 levels. The authors are careful
to note that the scenarios do not take into account all of the
economic, social and technical barriers facing farmers contemplating
such a conversion. Instead, they assume that in all cases in which
crops are substituted, alternative crops in the region are increased
proportionately, and that only crops which are currently grown
in the region are introduced.
<P>
The report makes a number of recommendations for improving California's
long-term water policy and planning. Among the recommendations
are the following: 1) promotion of the use of water-efficient
technologies; 2) gradual phaseout of most federal and state water
subsidies along with subsidies for low-value, water-intensive
crops; 3) establishment of a comprehensive groundwater management
program; and 4) support for water transfers in ways that improve
water efficiency, protect the environment, and promote the well-being
of rural communities (see description of the new SAREP-funded
Pacific Institute research project, page 3).
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
The report exposes in clear detail the weakness of current water
planning, marked by the persistence of a large gap between water
supply and expected demand. Beyond sounding the call for more
sustainable water use patterns, the report's chief appeal is its
attempt to stake out plausible alternatives that do not cause
severe negative impacts on any particular sector. Farmers and
others involved in agriculture should be particularly interested
in considering these alternatives, since DWR projections for 2020
show agriculture as the major economic loser if current water
use trends favoring urban and environmental interests continue
unchecked. By contrast, this report develops a scenario whereby
agriculture and urban users both cut water use, environmental
values are protected, and agriculture remains profitable. Whatever
its shortcomings, the report is to be commended for attempting
to stake out a &quot;common ground&quot; approach which advances
sustainability without sacrificing agriculture in the process.
<P>
Determining the plausibility of the report's agricultural change
scenario would require a more detailed follow-up study. This study
would have to take into account agronomic and marketing realities
which may prove to be more substantial barriers than this report
envisions. By its own admission, the report has oversimplified
the difficulties involved in the crop shifting scenarios at the
heart of its agricultural analysis. At a minimum, the changes
called for are not likely to be as painless as the authors suggest,
nor will the recommendations be greeted with equal favor among
all segments of the agricultural community. In trying to emphasize
what will be good for agriculture generally, they understate the
problems that these scenarios would imply for many individual
farmers, particularly those in the regions where overdraft problems
are currently the greatest. In the face of these difficulties
it is a little optimistic of the authors to state that no &quot;heroism&quot;
will be required in realizing their vision.
<P>
By introducing charts which compare crop revenue per acre-foot
of irrigation water used, the report focuses needed attention
on a critical issue: Given that water is a finite resource, the
achievement of sustainable agriculture in the state will require
us to not only consider how we grow but also what we grow. At
the same time, water is not the only criteria for defining the
sustainability of crop choices. In many cases there may be good
environmental or social reasons for using alfalfa, maintaining
irrigated pasture lands, etc., even though these are heavy water
users.
<P>
Like other sustainability issues, this one can only be resolved
through public debates with full participation of all affected
stakeholders. As the authors note, sustainability &quot;is a social
goal, much like equity, liberty, or justice. It implies an ethic.
Public value judgments must be made about which needs and wants
should be satisfied today-and what changes must be made to insure
a legacy for the future.&quot; The Pacific Institute's report
will no doubt become a common point of reference and a helpful
catalyst as the water sustainability debate proceeds.

<P>
Farmers, nonprofit organizations and others interested in sustainable
agriculture in the western states are invited to participate in
the August 18-20 meeting of the Western Region Coordinating Committee
(WRCC) 67 in Cheyenne, Wyoming. WRCCs are committees set up by
researchers at land grant universities and the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) to work cooperatively within a region on
specific topics. WRCC 67 began in 1988 when the USDA Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program began to help
direct this new effort in the West. <BR>

<P>
The committees are comprised primarily of researchers, but representatives
of a broad range of interest groups involved in sustainable agriculture
have attended WRCC 67 over the years, according to <B>David Granatstein</B>,
committee chair based at Washington State University. He notes
that state representatives report on relevant activities, specific
SARE projects are spotlighted, and members discuss SARE goals
and priorities. Field tours usually take place on the final day.
<BR>

<P>
Granatstein notes that WRCC 67 members would like to broaden the
committee's role in the western region. This year the committee
will conduct a more formal review of six SARE projects in progress.
Additionally, the committee hopes the meeting will serve as a
forum for the exchange of information about sustainable agriculture
activities, particularly for universities and nonprofit organizations.

1994 <BR>

<P>
Earthworms are increasingly recognized as indicators of agroecosystem
health and as important tools for ensuring soil improvement and
efficient nutrient cycling. In the past, SAREP has highlighted
both historical and recent research on earthworms (see <I>Sustainable
Agriculture News</I> 3(1): 5,11 and <I>Components</I> 1(4):6-9).
The literature has since proliferated rapidly; here we present
additional findings from more recent or underexposed research,
and include observations from an ongoing demonstration project,
Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems: BIOS (see <I>Sustainable
Agriculture</I> 5(5):2). <BR>

<H3>Tillage Effects</H3>

<P>
Parmelee et al. (1990) conducted a &quot;piggyback&quot; study
in long-term research plots at Horseshoe Bend in north-central
Georgia. The long-term trial involved a sandy clay loam soil planted
to a soybean-cereal rye-sorghum rotation and managed with vs.
without tillage. <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I> was the dominant
annelid earthworm, and <I>Lumbricus rubellus</I> was also present.
No-till management led to a 1.42-fold increase in annelid density
and biomass over those observed with conventional tillage. Detailed
sampling indicated that densities of Enchytraeidae (a family of
small earthworms) were higher under no-till, which contradicted
earlier preliminary sampling of the same plots (Hendrix et al.,
1986). When the pesticide carbofuran was used on the long-term
treatments, it resulted in a 47 percent increase in <I>particulate</I>
organic matter under the no-till regime. <BR>

<H3>Organic Matter and Nitrogen Cycling</H3>

<P>
Kretschmar and Ladd (1993) conducted a laboratory study of the
decomposition of subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I>)
foliage incubated in columns of loamy sand. Clover foliage was
incorporated at varying depths and soil was compacted at varying
pressures. The earthworm <I>Aporrectodea trapezoides</I> was then
added to some columns, but not to others. Results suggested that
if herbage was deeply incorporated or the soil highly compacted,
the earthworm alleviated the problems of decreased oxidation rates,
and thereby promoted decomposition of the residues. <BR>

<P>
Ruz Jerez et al. (1988) conducted a study on organic matter breakdown
and nitrification as influenced by the earthworms <I>Lumbricus
rubellus</I> or <I>Eisenia fetida</I>. The study was conducted
in 2-liter laboratory glass incubation chambers containing soil
(fine sandy loam) and earthworms (10 per chamber). (<I>Reviewer's
note: 5 earthworms per liter corresponds to high worm densities
in the field.</I>) Dried wilted or senescing clover or grass residue
was incorporated into the upper 1 cm of soil in each chamber 
<BR>

<P>
Following an initial amount of litter that would correspond to
700 kg dry matter (DM) per hectare, additional litter was added
at a rate of 350 kg DM per hectare per week for 10 weeks thereafter.
The total addition of clover or grass herbage during the 11 weeks
of the study was 4,200 kg DM per hectare.<I> (Reviewer's note:
This is about the amount of organic matter that would result from
one fairly close mowing of a cover crop of annual grasses. clovers,
or medics in a Californian orchard.) <BR>
</I>
<P>
The researchers observed an approximately 50 percent increase
in mineral nitrogen after 11 weeks' incubation with earthworms
as compared to without; mineral nitrogen was 9 percent higher
in chambers that were held at 22.5C than in those that were held
at 15C. When results were pooled over both temperatures, only
0.6 percent of the clover residue remained, whereas 9 percent
of the grass residue was recoverable; this difference is probably
related to differences in the residue's carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
as well as its palatability to earthworms. In chambers without
earthworms, 11.3 percent of the clover residue remained, and 13.7
percent of the grass residue. Microbial biomes was reduced in
chambers with earthworms. No information was presented comparing
results obtained for <I>Lumbricus rubellus</I> vs. <I>Eisenia
fetida.</I> <BR>

<P>
Test plants (ryegrass [<I>Lolium </I>sp.]) grown in the various
treatments following incubation suggested a 25 percent increase
in nitrogen uptake following incubation of herbage and soil with,
as opposed to without, earthworms. The authors suggested that
prior laboratory studies may have underestimated earthworm respiration
rates. <BR>

<P>
Marinissen and de Ruiter (1993) assessed data on the cycling of
nitrogen and organic matter from a study in the Netherlands, and
from the long-term study in Horseshoe Bend, Georgia (described
above under Parmelee et al., 1990). As in the Horseshoe Bend study,
the dominant annelid at the Netherlands site was <I>Aporrectodea
caliginosa</I> (constituting 92 percent of the wet biomass of
annelids). Other species observed at the Netherlands site were
<I>Lumbricus rubellus</I> (6%) and <I>Aporrectodea rosea</I> (296).
The researchers developed projections for nitrification based
on both direct and indirect effects of earthworms. Direct effects
were calculated based on varying assumptions concerning production
rates of dead tissue, casts, urine, and mucus. Other assumptions
that were varied concerned the carbon:nitrogen ratios of the earthworms
themselves and of the organic matter being processed. Indirect
effects of earthworms were also evaluated, based on the possibilities
that: 1) increased grazing by earthworms on microbes stimulates
microbial regrowth, and 2) earthworm-induced improvement of soil
structure promotes microbial activity. <BR>

<P>
Projections from the Netherlands data suggested that earthworms
are directly or indirectly responsible for nitrification of from
10 to 100 kg nitrogen per hectare per year Data from Horseshoe
Bend, where earthworm densities were higher, suggested corresponding
figures of from 82 to 364 kg nitrogen per hectare per year. These
widely varying projections reflect a need for more precise assessment
of the parameters employed in the models. <BR>

<H3>Soil Structural Changes</H3>

<P>
Lee and Foster (1991) composed a review article suggesting that
earthworm burrows are important for water infiltration only when
irrigation or rainfall exceeds the soil capacity for capillary
uptake. Moreover, anecic earthworms (those that make deep, permanent,
vertical tunnels) may block burrow entrances with soil or plant
material, or position their bodies to obstruct flow down the burrows.
Any of these phenomena make earthworm burrows less effective in
promoting water infiltration. <BR>

<P>
Other research has indicated that earthworm casts are frequently
more stable than aggregates composed of clay-organic matter complexes.
The authors point out that this is not always the case, but they
provided no explanation for the discrepancy. <BR>

<P>
Zhang and Schrader (1993) conducted laboratory studies on the
aggregate stability of &quot;natural,&quot; worm-induced, and
pressure-induced aggregates. Worm-induced aggregates from castings
and burrow linings were less stable than &quot;natural&quot;&quot;
aggregates, but more so than those formed by human agency through
mere compression. The authors considered it unlikely that earthworms
rupture mineral particles by compression, but did suggest that
the chemical bonds of natural aggregates may be ruptured during
ingestion by earthworms. The tensile strength (resistance to crushing)
of aggregates formed by the three species of earthworms assessed
was as follows:<I> Lumbricus</I> <I>terrestris&gt;Aporrectodea
longa&gt;Aporrectodea caliginosa</I>. Tensile strength was positively
correlated with organic matter content in the worm-formed aggregates.
<BR>

<H3>Toxicology</H3>

<P>
Martin (1986) conducted a toxicological study that indicated that
<I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I> is as sensitive or more so to pesticides
than are other agriculturally important earthworms. The author
suggested that this species would be a logical choice for screening
pesticides intended for use in pasture crops or crops grown in
rotation with pasture. <BR>

<H3>Fertilizers</H3>

<P>
Ma et al. (1990) assessed the effects of turfgrass fertilization
with six types of nitrogenous fertilizers, including mineral ammonium
sulfate, nitrochalk (ammonium nitrate with lime), sulfur-coated
urea, organic-coatedurea, isobutylidenediurea, and ureaformaldehyde.
There were three rates of application for each of the six fertilizers,
corresponding to 60, 120, and 180 kg nitrogen per hectare per
year The trial was carried out in a loamy sand soil in Haren,
Netherlands, on a turf that included various annual and perennial
grasses. Plots were 2.5 x 3.0 m and arrayed in a randomized complete
block with two replications for each of 18 treatments. <BR>

<P>
Results suggested profound reductions caused by ammonium sulfate
and by sulfur-coated urea in the endogeic earthworms <I>Aporrectodea
caliginosa caliginosa</I> and <I>Aporrectodea rosea</I>. By contrast,
the endogeic earthworm <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I> <I>tuberculata</I>
and the <I>epigeic Lumbricus</I> <I>rubellus </I>showed less reduction.
The observed reductions were believed by the authors to have been
caused by acidification. (Editor's note: Endogeic species forage
below the soil surface in horizontal, branching burrows; epigeic
species live in the superficial soil layers and feed on undecomposed
plant litter.)  <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata</I> and<I>
Lumbricus rubellus</I> have in the past been noted as tolerant
of acid soils, whereas the types of worms showing reductions have
been regarded as doing best near neutral pH. Nitrochalk had little
effect on earthworm densities, and the other fertilizers had intermediate
effects. <BR>

<H3>Collections From Merced County Almond Orchards</H3>

<P>
As part of the BIOS project in Merced County, California, seven
growers collected earthworms from their orchards. These worms
were identified by specialists Matthew Werner of the UC Santa
Cruz Agroecology Program and Sam James of Maharishi International
University, Iowa. <BR>

<P>
The endogeic earthworm <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I> was the
most widely-distributed species, having been collected in all
the orchards sampled. This nominal species is now regarded as
a complex of three closely related species (Matthew Werner, pers.
comm.). As noted in the above synopses, <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I>
is frequently encountered in other farming systems. It is regarded
as having agricultural importance, and diverse feeding habits,
including feeding on soft tissue of plant litter at the soil surface
or on dead roots below the soil surface (reviewed by Lee, 1985).
<BR>

<P>
Werner noted that specimens of <I>Aporrectodea caliginosa</I>
from three of the orchards were unpigmented, indicating a strictly
subterranean existence. One of these farms also included <I>Aporrectodea
turgida</I> and was the only orchard at which the epigeic species<I>
Lumbricus rubellus</I> could be found. Specimens of <I>Aporrectodea
caliginosa</I> from the remaining four farms had moderate to heavy
pigmentation, suggesting at least occasional above-ground feeding,
casting, or travel. On one of these farms, the endogeic species
<I>Amynthas diffringens</I> and <I>Microscolex dubius</I> were
also collected. <BR>

<P>
No anecic earthworms were found, nor have obvious middens been
seen at any of the BIOS farms. In light of the apparent lack of
anecics, Werner has suggested inoculative release of the anecic
earthworms <I>Lumbricus terrestris</I> or <I>Aporrectodea longa</I>
to promote more rapid litter incorporation. It is striking that
three of the four species collected recently at BIOS farms (<I>Aporrectodea
caliginosa</I>, <I>Lumbricus rubellus</I>, and <I>Microscolex
dubius)</I> are renowned as &quot;peregrine or &quot;wandering&quot;
earthworms, because they have frequently been transported by humans
to new locations (Lee, 1985). <BR>

1995
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Managing cover crops in orchards or vineyards depends in part
on understanding their basic biology. This article, presented
in two parts, reviews several aspects of cover crop biology. Part
I (see <I>Sustainable Agriculture</I>, Vol. 7, No. 4, p. 15) dealt
with seeds, seedlings, root-zone biology, nutrient uptake, and
the fate of cover crop-derived nitrogen. Part II presented here
concerns plant community dynamics and allelopathy. Most of the
plant species discussed may be used as cover crops or as forage
crops in rangeland settings. The issues raised have general applicability
to a number of farming systems in California.
<H3>Yields and Competition in Multispecies Stands</H3>

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Sb 1Stone Serif Semibold">Cover Crops and Trees
or Vines<BR>
</FONT></B>Wick and Alleweldt (1983) showed that, when grown together
in containers, subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterranean</I>
cv 'Clare') caused a 20 percent reduction in growth of Riesling
grape vines. The mechanism for this inhibition was not known,
and it occurred regardless of the level of nitrogen fertilization.
No such inhibitory effect was seen for subterranean clover cv
'Daliak' or for white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I>). The legumes
supplied nitrogen to the vines when only low amounts of nitrogen
were added, and there was higher use of water by vines with legumes.
When grown in a young vineyard, 'Daliak' showed more rapid early
growth than white clover, but was damaged by frost and did not
reseed. 
<P>
In Arkansas, Stasiak (1990) planted peach trees of two scion and
two rootstock types into either bare ground or preestablished
stands of subterranean clover in the tree rows. With both bare
and clover plots, permanent drive middles were maintained in a
sod of mixed tall fescue and bermudagrass. Comparison indicated
that tree rows with preexisting subterranean clover led to reduced
peach tree vigor (shoot growth, trunk cross-sectional area, foliar
nitrogen content) during the first year of growth. By the second
year, this tendency was eliminated. Stasiak suggested planting
subterranean clover in August following the first season of peach
tree growth, rather than planting peach trees into preestablished
subterranean clover.
<P>
Orchardgrass (<I>Dactylis glomerata</I>, cv 'Berber'), a vigorous
perennial bunchgrass, when grown as a cover crop reduced vine
growth by 58 percent and yield by 53 percent of Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes in Santa Barbara County of California, although the site
featured highly fertile soil (Wolpert et al. 1993). This effect
was due at least in part to increased water stress of the vines.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Multiple Legumes<BR>
</B>Williams et al. (1968) showed that subterranean clover has,
on the average, larger seed than does crimson clover (<I>Trifolium
incarnatum</I>), and plot studies indicated that the former will
tend to dominate in mixtures due to more rapid early growth and
shading of the crimson clover. When larger seeds of crimson clover
were selected and interseeded with smaller seeds of subterranean
clover, the pattern was reversed. Crimson clover was not eliminated
from any of the mixtures evaluated.
<P>
Hill and Gleeson (1991) found that when paired with either 'Seaton
Park' or 'Daliak' subterranean clovers (both <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I>
ssp. subterranean) in a three-year field study, the cultivar 'Clare'
(<I>Trifolium subterranean</I> ssp. brachycalycinum) dominated
the mixed stands. Soil pH was about 5.5, mowing was once every
four weeks. Petiole length of 'Clare' is much greater than the
early-maturing 'Daliak,' and slightly greater than the mid-season
maturing 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' also showed better seedling vigor
and survival and greater seed production per plant under stress.
Dry matter production by 'Clare' also is less dependent on plant
density. There was evidence of overyielding by mixtures of 'Clare'
and 'Seaton Park.' (Overyielding refers to the situation where
the yield of the polyculture exceeds the yield of its highest
yielding component grown in monoculture.) 'Clare' seed reserves
appeared to be more greatly reduced over the summer months than
those of 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak'. <I>T. s.</I> ssp. brachycalycinum
is supposedly adapted to neutral to alkaline soils, and is believed
less tolerant to close grazing and less able to bury its burs
than is <I>T. subterraneum</I>.
<P>
Williams (1963) sowed crimson clover (strain S. Australian commercial),
rose clover (<I>Trifolium hirtum</I>, strain S.6), and subterranean
clover (cv 'Bacchus') in pure plantings and in three 1:1 mixtures
of two species each. Competition for light was assessed in relation
to leaf area and leaf position in the canopy. Leaf area in 4-cm
horizontal strata, leaf weight, shoot weight production, and light
penetration through canopies were measured at intervals during
the vegetative phase (i.e., through 99 days after sowing). Crimson
and rose clovers held apparent initial advantages over subterranean
clover, in terms of light-absorbing surface area of cotyledons
and first unifoliate leaves, and because these leaves were elevated
further from the soil surface. However, this situation changed
with time. In paired sowings, crimson and subterranean clover
became equally dominant over rose clover, while subterranean clover
overtopped crimson clover despite the greater total leaf area
of the latter. The most productive mixture (crimson clover + subterranean
clover) was no more productive than the best species in monoculture
(crimson clover). As noted by Williams (1963a), competition has
other dimensions than those reported here, including the advantage
conferred by hardseededness of rose clover, which enables it to
dominate multispecies stands following droughts that kill clover
seedlings.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes and Non-Leguminous Forbs<BR>
</B>Guerrero and Williams (1975) conducted several growth chamber
studies. In one study, Filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I>) and subterranean
clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I> ssp. subterranean cv 'Woogenellup')
were grown in sole and mixed cultures in a phosphorus-deficient
range soil (from Butte County) and in sand with differing levels
of supplemental nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Filaree dominated
if phosphorus was limiting, whereas subterranean clover dominated
if nitrogen was left out of the fertilizer. Subterranean clover
has a higher requirement for phosphorus than does filaree, and
also appears less capable of exploiting insoluble phosphate sources.
For this reason, addition of superphosphate to rangeland soils
was suggested by the authors as a means of promoting subterranean
clover.
<P>
Moore et al. (1989) found in pot experiments in Australia that
subterranean clover can suppress the seedlings of the perennial
weed St. John's Wort (<I>Hypericum perforatum</I>) by overtopping
the seedlings and shading them out. This study confirmed earlier
findings that subterranean clover could suppress the weed if sown
into native pastures, particularly if phosphate fertilizers had
been applied. The importance of maintaining a closed canopy of
subterranean clover during the early phase of weed seedling growth
is emphasized.
<P>
<B>Legumes and Grasses<BR>
</B>Motazedian and Sharrow (1986) conducted a field study of stands
of subterranean clover and perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I>),
in which mowing height and frequency were varied. In stands dominated
by perennial ryegrass, greater stubble heights led to greater
productivity; the opposite was true for stands dominated by subterranean
clover. The greatest interval between defoliations (49 days) led
to the greatest productivity of the stands.
<P>
In the southwest portion of Western Australia, Cotterill (1990)
used unirrigated 35 x 35 cm plots to evaluate competition between
cool-season annual grasses and either 'Serena' bur medic or 'Seaton
Park' subterranean clover in a ley farming system (wheat-pasture
rotation). He found that dry matter production by the legumes
was depressed linearly with increasing seeding rates for various
cool-season annual grasses, including ripgut brome (<I>Bromus
diandrus</I>), wild barley (<I>Hordeum leporinum</I>), a ryegrass
(<I>Lolium rigidum</I>), and rattail fescue (<I>Vulpia myuros</I>).
Additionally, second-year legume biomass production was not significantly
depressed by grasses seeded the first year, as long as grass seeding
rates were less than 40 percent of the full rates. Full seeding
rates for grasses were over eight million seeds per hectare, while
those for the legumes were about two million seeds per hectare.
When seeded without grasses, the subterranean clover produced
the equivalent of 3.1 metric tons of biomass per hectare and the
bur medic about 1.5 metric tons per hectare. Pooled across all
levels of grasses, the corresponding results for subterranean
clover and bur medic were nearly identical at about 1 metric ton
per hectare.
<P>
In Austria, Danso et al. (1991) conducted a two-year trial in
a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (<I>Trifolium pratense</I>
cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I> cv
'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I> cv 'Tacuabe').
White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the
first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated. In the first
year, both legumes contributed about equally to the approximately
130 kg of nitrogen per hectare fixed in the sward. In the second
year, white clover only contributed five percent of the 46 kg
of nitrogen per hectare fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures
containing the two legumes have an advantage because the early
production by white clover is complemented by later production
and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil. Stands with multiple
legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes, Non-Leguminous Forbs, and a Grass<BR>
</B>Mohler and Liebman (1987) reported that high-density plantings
of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped
barley and field pea (<I>Pisum arvense</I>). Weed suppression
appeared to be a result of competition for soil moisture. Weed
populations were not reduced, but weed biomass was lower.
<P>
Liebman and Robichaux (1990) found that intercropped barley and
field pea  were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica
kaber</I>) and white mustard (<I>B. hirta</I>) than was a dense
monoculture of barley. The main mechanisms of weed suppression
were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen
(especially by the barley). A long-vined variety of field pea
('Century') was better than a short-vined variety ('Alaska') at
suppressing mustard growth by shading. 'Century' also showed a
greater yield.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legume, Grass, and Various Herbs<BR>
</B>A four-year study in Maryland by Teasdale et al. (1991) suggested
that, under no-till management, hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I>)
was particularly effective at reducing the densities of the following
weeds: goosegrass (<I>Eleusine indica</I>), stinkgrass (<I>Eragrostis
cilianensis</I>), and carpetweed (<I>Mollugo verticillata</I>).
Under conventional tillage, hairy vetch appeared during one year
to increase the densities of large crabgrass (<I>Digitaria sanguinalis</I>)
above those observed without a cover crop or with cereal rye (<I>Secale
cereale</I> cv 'Abruzzi'). In some years, cereal rye grown as
a no-till cover crop significantly reduced the densities of the
goosegrass and carpetweed. In one year, cereal rye managed with
tillage led to increased densities of common lambsquarters (<I>Chenopodium
album</I>).
<P>
Teasdale and Mohler (1993) in Maryland and New York State tested
the effects of mulching on light transmittance, soil temperature,
and soil moisture. The mulch in this study was the clipped residue
of herbicide-killed hairy vetch or cereal rye (cv 'Aroostook').
Data for light transmittance and soil temperature suggest that
cereal rye and hairy vetch residues have similar initial properties,
but that there is more rapid and thorough decomposition of hairy
vetch residue. Therefore, cereal rye provides a longer-lasting
mulch that blocks light and reduces soil temperature longer.
<P>
In a study encompassing two growing seasons at Beltsville, Maryland,
Teasdale and Daughtry (1993) showed that living hairy vetch was
more effective than standing, paraquat-killed vetch at suppressing
weed germination and growth. During droughty periods in both growing
seasons, soil moisture was significantly greater in the surface
2.5 cm of soil under living or dead hairy vetch, as contrasted
with bare soil. In one year of this study (1990), living vetch
led to significantly lower soil moisture than did killed vetch.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Grass and a Non-Leguminous Forbs<BR>
</B>Soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I>) suppresses broadleaf filaree
(<I>Erodium botrys</I>) by shading more effectively under conditions
of adequate sulfur (McCown and Williams 1968). When sulfur is
limited, broadleaf filaree accesses it sooner because of more
rapid extension of its young roots.<BR>

<P>
<B>Allelopathy</B>
<P>
Bialy et al. (1990) found that black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I>)
and brown mustard (<I>Brassica juncea</I>) show allelopathic inhibition
of other plants. Compounds involved probably include various isothiocyanates,
which suppressed wheat germination and growth.
<P>
Cereal rye produces several compounds that inhibit crops and weeds.
The most active compounds are two hydroxamic acids and their breakdown
products (Chase et al. 1991). Wocjcik-Wojtkowiak et al. (1990)
reported that residues of tillering plants and rye crop residues
contain much lower amounts of allelopathic compounds (various
phenolic acids) than do seedlings.

Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches)
contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into
soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound
(Schenk and Werner 1991). This chemical can cause reduced growth
in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce. Pea was only slightly
affected.

<H3>Background</H3>
<P>
This paper is part of a larger study entitled<I> Production Practices
and Sample Costs for Organic Cotton _ Northern San Joaquin Valley-
1995</I>. The complete study is one of a series of reports from
the project <I>Practices and Performance of California's Organically
Grown Crops</I>. The project was undertaken to document the production
practices and associated costs for a variety of organically produced
commodities in California. Overall goals include assessment of
the economic viability of alternative farming systems, dissemination
of information to growers, researchers, policy-makers, and industry,
and identification of areas where further research is necessary.
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
The California cotton production industry ranks second in cotton
production in the nation with over one million acres of irrigated
cropland. Cotton is the fifth largest contributor to total farm
income in the state, and regularly has a gross value of approximately
$1 billion in seed and lint.
<P>
In recent years California's organic agricultural industry has
expanded considerably. The production of organic cotton has likewise
increased. Several San Joaquin Valley growers now devote a portion
of their acreage to the production of organic cotton, with a substantial
number of those acres located in the Northern San Joaquin Valley.
Crops rotated with organic cotton include alfalfa, dried beans,
leguminous green manure crops (bell beans, peas, and vetch), processing
tomatoes, oats, and wheat. 
<H3>Materials and Methods</H3>
<P>
Grower interviews served as the basis of information for <I>Production
Practices and Sample Costs for Organic Cotton- Northern San Joaquin
Valley _ 1995</I>. The report was further developed in cooperation
with Extension specialists, farm advisors, researchers, and industry
representatives. The larger study consists of two distinct parts:
a narrative and an economic analysis. The narrative details the
range of approaches possible for organic production of cotton,
with sections on production and ginning practices, crop rotation
and diversification, cover crops, pest management, grower risk
and marketing, and state and federal organic regulation. A summary
of the narrative section is included here.
<P>
The complete economic analysis is a cost and returns estimate
for a hypothetical farm. Enterprise budgets are generated in several
formats: costs per acre by operation, costs per acre by input,
monthly cash costs, investment, and business overhead, and a profitability
ranging analysis. Summary tables for cash costs per acre and net
returns per acre above cash costs are presented after the references.
<H3>Results and Discussion</H3>
<P>
Many of the production practices for organically grown cotton
are similar to that of the conventionally grown crop. Production
differences are seen primarily in soil fertility and pest management,
and in boll maturation and defoliation techniques. Harvest and
ginning practices are somewhat modified. 
<P>
<B>Soil Fertility. </B>Organic growers manage soil fertility using
a number of different strategies. Composted animal manures are
spread and incorporated into soils to provide organic matter,
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. Cover or
green manure crops have also been successfully managed and rotated
on a small scale in the short winter between production seasons.
Grasses such as barley and wheat, and legumes such as bell beans,
winter peas, and vetch are typically planted. In addition, crop
rotation and diversification assist in nutrient cycling and organic
matter management. Organic matter is particularly important for
improving soil structure, and for providing nitrogen and other
nutrients for crop production.
<P>
<B>Pest Management.</B> Pest identification, monitoring, and prevention
are essential elements of successful cotton production. This is
especially true for organic production because most of the pesticides
that are currently used by producers of conventionally grown cotton
are not approved for use by growers of organic cotton. Moreover,
allowed pest control products are generally not as effective as
synthetic pesticides for immediate or acute problems.
<P>
Insect and mite pests are managed by monitoring the level of natural
predators, parasites and parasitoids, and by the release of biological
control agents to augment those which already exist in the field.
Natural predators, parasites and parasitoids found in Northern
San Joaquin Valley cotton fields include: assassin bugs (Family
Reduviidae), bigeyed bugs (<I>Geocoris</I> spp.), minute pirate
bugs (<I>Orius</I> spp.) and various spiders and parasitic wasps.
Green lacewing larvae (<I>Chrysopa</I> spp.) are often released
to help reduce populations of lygus bugs, mites and other soft-bodied
insects such as aphids. Predaceous mites and beneficial wasps
of the genus <I>Trichogramma</I> have also been released to help
reduce populations of various insects and caterpillars.
<P>
Other strategies used for arthropod management include: plant
neighboring trap crops or habitats to attract beneficial insects,
crop rotation and diversification, water management, and the use
of organically acceptable pesticides. For example, sulfur dust
is sometimes used to control mites in fields or field perimeters.
<P>
Weeds are managed primarily with mechanical cultivations, and
hand chopping and hoeing. Growers report greater difficulty in
managing weeds in organic cotton acreages than in conventional
cotton acreages. Furthermore, greater difficulty is encountered
in managing perennial weeds over annual weeds. Perennial weeds
are sometimes managed by rotating land with known problems out
of cotton and into a winter wheat (or other grain) crop. By spring,
the grain crop is established and has the potential to suppress
germination of perennial weeds by excluding sunlight. Because
the overwintered grain crop is not irrigated in the spring, weeds
must also compete with the established crop for water. In some
cases, fields may be fallowed over the winter and cultivated multiple
times in the spring and early summer to reduce perennial weed
growth. In contrast, herbicides, mechanical cultivations and hand
hoeing are used to control annual and perennial weeds in conventional
fields. 
<P>
<B>Boll Maturation and Defoliation.</B> The synthetic growth regulators
and defoliants used for conventionally grown cotton are not approved
for use in organic cotton production. Growers instead rely on
nutrient and water management to assist in boll maturation, opening
and plant defoliation. For example, growers supply only enough
nitrogen to insure fruit set and boll development on a yearly
basis. Overfertilization or excessive soil nitrogen promotes vegetative
growth and discourages boll maturation. Zinc sulfate is foliar-applied
to assist in boll maturation and opening. A soil or plant deficiency
in either zinc or sulfur must be demonstrated before this material
can be applied. Also, water is cut off early in the season in
an attempt to stress plants and aid in defoliation.
<P>
While helpful, these techniques do not always achieve the same
results as the synthetically formulated materials. In cases where
a low level of defoliation is attained, harvest may be slowed
and cotton grades reduced, with trash levels and ginning costs
increased.
<P>
<B>Harvest and Ginning.</B> Organically grown cotton is best harvested
with a low moisture content so that, if necessary, cotton can
be stored for a period of time prior to ginning without reducing
grade or quality. To achieve this, harvest of organic cotton often
begins later and is finished earlier in the day than is typical
for conventionally grown cotton.
<P>
Low moisture content, and the potential for storage is particularly
important because state law and certification agency regulations
require organic and conventional cotton to remain separated at
the gin if the product is to be sold on the organic market. Gins
must shut down and clean out their machinery prior to processing
organic cotton in order to meet these regulations. Consequently,
a gin may not be immediately available to accept and gin the organic
seed cotton, resulting in the need for storage. Cotton that is
harvested at a relatively high moisture content, and not ginned
promptly, may have lower grades due to lint staining caused by
leaf trash. In addition, decomposition of seed cotton can occur.
<P>
<B>Yields. </B>Yields for organically produced cotton in the Northern
San Joaquin Valley range from 1.3 to 2.0 (500 pound) bales per
acre for cotton lint, and 1,100 to 1,500 pounds per acre for cottonseed.
This yield range is somewhat lower than the five year average
for conventionally grown cotton in the same area.
<P>
<B>Costs and Returns.</B> Cash costs are summarized in Table 1.
Cultural costs include land preparation, planting, irrigation,
and fertility and pest management. Labor, fuel, and repair costs
are also included in this category. Ownership costs of durable
(tractors, equipment, and irrigation system) are not included.
Business overhead includes land rent, office expenses, soil analyses,
sanitation services, liability and property insurance, and investment
repairs. Assessment fees are paid to both state and certification
agencies to comply with organic farming regulations. For various
other purposes fees are also paid to the National Cotton Council,
Cotton Incorporated, USDA High Volume Instrumentation, California
Cotton Growers and Ginners Association and the California Department
of Food and Agriculture Pink Bollworm Project. 
<P>
Returns to organic growers usually range from $1.00 to $1.40 per
pound lint which includes an organic premium. However, price premiums
are not guaranteed, nor are all bales necessarily sold at one
set price. At present the market for organic cotton is volatile,
that is, demand and price vary significantly from year to year.
If a market for organic cotton lint is unavailable in any given
year, lint is sold on the conventional market without receiving
a premium. For 1995, the preliminary price is estimated to be
$0.815 per pound lint.
<P>
Net returns per acre above cash costs are summarized in Table
2. With an estimated price premium of $1.00 per pound for organic
cotton lint, net returns are positive at a yield of 850 pounds
lint per acre. All yield and price combinations above this level
are also positive. However, cost calculations indicate that growers
must receive a price premium for the crop to remain economically
viable.<BR>

1994</FONT>
<P>
The inclusion of farmers in the agricultural research and extension
process has emerged as a central theme in the development of more
sustainable production systems.  Though this call for farmer participation
has become more widespread, few studies have documented the actual
process whereby farmers participate with scientists in defining,
implementing, and/or evaluating research.  In 1991, we began just
such a collaborative grower-scientist pest management research
project.  The objectives were to develop a research agenda in
cooperation with peach growers, implement scientific studies that
addressed questions raised by farmers, evaluate the effectiveness
of this participatory approach in generating relevant information,
and document the overall process.  This paper reports on two of
these objectives.  First, we provide a brief description of the
development of the research agenda.  Second, we present the results
from the on-farm studies.
<H3>Developing a Research Agenda</H3>

<P>
The research program was developed in collaboration with members
of the non-profit organization California Clean Growers Association(CCGA)
utilizing a methodology called participatory rural appraisal (PRA).
 PRA combines secondary data review, semi-structured interviews,
observation of farm activities, and formal and informal group
meetings to identify and evaluate specific needs (Dlott et al.
1994).  From this work, we developed a research program for the
1_0-91 season.  Our focus was on the peach twig borer (PTB), <I>Anarsia
lineatella, </I>which was identified by peach farmers as the key
insect pest in their production systems.  Farmers further expressed
interest in understanding and improving biological and cultural
controls of PTB that would work in conjunction with <I>Bacillus
thuringiensis </I>(Bt) and pheromone confusion.
<P>
Following the 1991 field season, a focus group meeting was held
with the I 1 -member CCGA Board of Directors, and four observers:
three agricultural scientists with expertise in entomology, agronomy,
and sustainable agriculture, and a meeting recorder who took notes
as well as made an audio recording.  The purpose of the meeting
was to evaluate the project and then refine future research activities.
 The outcome of the meeting was a set of farmer-generated research
questions, which included: 1) What beneficial insects are eating
PTB? 2) How does weather affect PTB survival? 3) What is the feeding
pattern of PTB?
<P>
In response to these questions, a series of predator exclusion
experiments was conducted in 1992 and 1993.  The experiments were
designed to identify PTB mortality caused by generalist predators
(e.g., ladybird beetles, green lacewings, ants, minute pirate
bugs) and climatic conditions (referred to as &quot;abiotic mortality&quot;).
 The exclusion experiments focused on the impact of generalist
predators because recent work by Daane et al. (1993) has shown
that parasitoid activity on PTB is relatively low in Fresno and
Tulare counties.
<H3>Materials and Methods</H3>

<P>
An experimental plot of 60 three-year-old 'Diamond Princess' peach
trees was established in 1992 at a farm in Dinuba, California.
 A second field site consisting of 100 twelve-year old organically
managed 'Flame crest' peach trees arranged 5 rows by 20 trees
was established in 1993 at a farm in Kingsburg, California.  Insect
pest management at these sites included a dormant season oil application
for the San Jose Scale (SJS), <I>Quadraspidiotus perniciosus;
</I>pheromone confusion for the oriental fruit moth (OFM) <I>Grapholita
molests; </I>and, at the Kingsburg site only, three applications
of Bt at bloom for PTB.  The plots received no applications of
insecticides, fungicides, or fertilizers when experiments were
underway.  The orchard floors at both plots were covered by a
mixture of planted cover-crops and endemic plant species.
<P>
In each plot, shoots with 3-S lateral shoots located in the top
meter of trees were selected.  Three treatments were established
in a randomized complete block design.  Then each shoot was infested
with a single PTB larva coinciding with the natural emergence
of larvae in the area.  The three treatments were:
<P>
1)    Full exclusion (shoot enclosed in an organdy cage): designed
to remove the effect of predation.
<P>
2) Partial exclusion (shoot isolated by a barrier of Tanglefoot
placed around the base of the terminal shoot): designed to remove
the effect of predation by the ant <I>Forinica aerata.</I>
<P>
3) Open: designed to estimate the combined effects of predation
and abiotic mortality.
<P>
Natural enemy species composition and relative abundance were
measured by direct observation of open and partially excluded
shoots.  Generalist predators observed on shoots were tested in
laboratory no-choice trials to determine if they fed on PTB larvae.
 Shoot attack rates, measured by the presence of one or more damaged
shoots per larva, were determined by monitoring shoots for damage
at 2-3 day intervals.  On the last sampling date, shoots in all
treatments were removed from trees and dissected in the field
using a dissecting microscope.  This confirmed previously recorded
shoot damage, corrected for damage in earlier sampling, and allowed
for the collection of surviving larvae.  The stage of recovered
larvae was noted.  All experiments were terminated when larvae
in the partial exclusion treatment were fourth and fifth instars.
<P>
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for effect of treatment
and block on: 1) natural enemy relative abundance, 2) larval attack
rate, and 3) larval survival.  Treatment means for larval attack
rate and survival were compared with Tukey's multiple comparison
test (P &lt; 0.05).
<H3>Results</H3>

<P>
<B>Generalist Predator Abundance</B>.  Generalist predators observed
in this study included: a predatory ant, <I>R aerata, </I>convergent
lady beetle, green lacewing species, a minute pirate bug species,
and two salticid spiders, <I>Sassicus virus </I>and <I>Thiodina
</I>sp.  All of the predaceous stages of the observed generalist
predators fed on PTB larvae in laboratory nochoice trials.  The
species composition and relative abundance varied between successive
PTB generations and farm sites.  E <I>aerata </I>was the only
predator observed on treatment shoots in all experiments, and
only its densities were significantly higher in the open versus
partial exclusion treatments.  Relative abundance of all other
generalist predators was not significantly different between these
two treatments.  This indicates that the Tanglefoot barrier significantly
reduced predation pressure from <I>R aerata.</I>
<P>
<B>Survival of PTB</B> <B>Larvae.  </B>Larval survival rates were
significantly lower in the open treatment as compared to the partial
and full exclusion treatments in experiments conducted in the
overwintering generation 1992, overwintering generation 1993,
and first generation 1993.  <I>F. aerata </I>activity was significantly
higher on open shoots accounting for the only significant difference
in generalist predator abundance.  These results provide direct
evidence that PTB larval survival significantly increases when
<I>R aerata </I>are excluded from foraging on shoots.  The data
also suggest that predation by <I>E aerata </I>is the reason for
the differences in larval survival among treatments.
<P>
Larval survival during the second to fifth instars in the second
generation (1993) also was significantly lower for both the partial
exclusion and open treatments compared to the full exclusion treatment.
 PTB mortality in the partial exclusion treatment can be explained,
in part, by the abundance of jumping spiders at this site.  The
Tanglefoot barrier did not significantly restrict their movement,
as compared to the movement of E <I>aerata.</I>
<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>
The predator exclusion experiments provide evidence that predation
by <I>F aerata </I>significantly decreases PTB larval survival
rates.  The Tanglefoot barrier provided an effective means for
segregating <I>F. aerata </I>from convergent lady beetles, green
lacewings, and minute pirate bugs and the results indicate that
these other generalist predators did not account for significant
mortality of PTB larvae.  In addition, larval survival rates were
not significantly different between full and partial exclusion
treatments.  These results indicate that mortality due to generalist
predators other than the ant, <I>E aerata, </I>was minimal.  The
data from these experiments was put into &quot;life table analysis&quot;
and gave similar results, showing that predation by <I>R aerata
</I>is the most important overall mortality factor for PTB larvae
(Dlott, 1993).
<P>
Now that <I>F. aerata </I>has been identified as the most important
TB predator, the question remains whether or not this predator
can be manipulated to the growers' advantage.  To  answer this
question we must consider the biology of <I>F.</I> <I>aerata.
 </I>Some ant species aggregate to abundant food sources, such
as extrafloral nectar, and once on the plants, also seek prey.
 <I>F. aerata </I>appears to exhibit such foraging behaviors on
peaches in the Central Valley.  However, <I>E.</I> <I>aerata </I>also
exhibits other less desirable behavior, such as tending honey
dew-producing scale and aphid insects.  Shorey et al. (1993) reported
that <I>F. aerata </I>tended several aphid species in plum trees
in Tulare County.  Aphid outbreaks appear to be more common in
plums than in peaches, a phenomenon that may be linked to this
ant-aphid relationship.  Some varieties of plum are known to produce
only small amounts of extrafloral nectar.  Under these conditions,
R <I>aerata </I>may switch from foraging on nectar to &quot;tending&quot;
aphids, leading to increases in aphid populations.
<P>
We are currently working with growers to determine which cultural
practices can be used to &quot;conserve&quot; ant colonies.  Several
observations may be of interest.  First, in peach orchards managed
without in-season broad spectrum insecticides, two ant species
are commonly found, <I>F. aerata </I>and the southern fire ant,
<I>Solenopsis xyloni, </I>with <I>F. aerata </I>being the dominant
species.  Second, it appears that cover crops on the orchard floor
may affect ant species composition and numbers by providing alternative
food sources (e.g., herbivore prey, seeds or nectar) as well as
changing the microclimate and soil texture.  Finally, using selective
management tactics, such as substituting Bt sprays at bloom for
broad spectrum insecticides, are an important component in fostering
biological control of PTB.  We believe that a better understanding
of how cultural practices increase or decrease population levels
of ant species could lead to exciting new options in stone fruit
integrated pest management.

<H1>Rangeland health: New methods to lassify, inventory, and 
monitor rangelands.
</H1>

<P>
<I>National Resource Council, Committee on Rangeland<BR>
<I>Classification</I></I>
<P>
National Academy Press, Washington, DC. 1994<BR>

<P>
Rangeland ecosystems make up between 40 and 50 percent of the
land area of the U.S., spanning a diversity of climates and geographic
regions. As the debate over the health and management of these
lands has increased, scientists have begun to question the methods
and data used to classify and describe rangeland resources. One
of the primary reasons for raising these questions is that, even
when using the same methods and data, experts are not in agreement
about the health and sustainability of our nation's rangelands.
The purpose of this National Academy of Sciences report was to
examine the scientific basis of the current methods of analysis
and classification used by the three federal agencies involved
in rangeland management: the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
National Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS, formerly SCS)
and Forest Service (USFS), and the U.S. Department of Interior's
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
<P>
The Committee on Rangeland Classification that produced this report
established three objectives for their study: 1) analyze historical
and current procedures used by federal agencies to assess rangelands;
2) evaluate the success of current systems as tools for characterizing
rangeland health and ecological condition; and 3) identify the
primary scientific obstacles to developing improved systems.
<P>
In order to fulfill these objectives, the Committee organized
their fact-finding and deliberations around five key areas. These
five areas are reflected in the organization of the report.
<P>
Report Highlights
<P>
Chapter 1, <I>Rangelands are Important</I>, inventories the various
products, commodities and benefits derived from rangelands. This
chapter also outlines the history of rangeland use and management
and highlights the need for accurate assessments of rangeland
productivity and long-term health.
<P>
Chapter 2, <I>Rangeland Health</I>, identifies the goals of national
assessments and recommends standards for these assessments. This
chapter also presents a method for determining when the threshold
from health to degradation is crossed, and defines the role rangeland
health assessments should play in the larger effort to characterize,
monitor, and manage rangelands.
<P>
Chapter 3, <I>Current Methods of Rangeland Assessment</I>, examines
the development of current theory and practice for rangeland assessment.
This chapter also evaluates the assessment methods used by federal
agencies and their suitability for assessing rangeland health.
<P>
Chapter 4, <I>Criteria and Indicators of Rangeland Health</I>,
recommends that the health of rangeland be assessed by evaluating
three sets of criteria: 1) the stability of soils and watersheds;
2) the integrity of nutrient cycles and energy flows, and 3) the
functioning of ecological processes that enable rangelands to
recover from damage. The Committee introduces an initial set of
indicators and quality standards, and argues strongly for a more
consistent interpretation of rangeland health among technical
assistance and land management agencies.
<P>
Chapter 5, <I>Inventorying and Monitoring Rangeland Health</I>,
reviews some of the past inventories and national surveys of rangeland
quality. This chapter also describes current inventorying and
monitoring systems, and underscores the need for new or revised
systems that are capable of generating the information needed
for a national-level assessment.
<OL>
<LI>The report acknowledges the importance of the many rangeland
inventories that have been conducted in the past, but issues a
challenge for a bona fide national-level assessment of rangeland
health. Such an assessment, according to the report, would require:

<LI>adoption of a standardized and consistent definition of rangeland
health and of measurable indicators of change; 2) consistent and
well correlated classification of federal and nonfederal rangelands;

<LI> collection of data by the same or similar methods that will
enable the data to be combined on a national level; 4) collection
of data on the basis of a statistically valid sampling scheme;
and 5) periodic and consistent repetition of sampling to detect
trends in the measures used to evaluate rangeland health.
</OL>

<P>
In conclusion, the committee identifies six action items needed
to organize a meaningful and accurate national level assessment
of rangeland health. These are: 
<OL>
<LI>The secretaries of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and Department of the Interior (DOI) should convene an interagency
task force to develop, test, and standardize indicators and methods
for inventorying and monitoring rangeland health on federal and
nonfederal rangelands.
<LI>The secretaries of USDA and DOI should develop coordinated
plans for implementing a system of periodic sampling on federal
and nonfederal rangelands that will produce accurate estimates
of, and determine changes in the proportion of healthy, at-risk,
and unhealthy rangelands.
<LI>Indicators of soil surface condition should be added to all
current and ongoing range condition and ecological status assessments,
and any other ongoing efforts to assess rangelands, as a first
step toward a more comprehensive evaluation of rangeland health.
<LI>All current and ongoing rangeland assessments done as part
of the Resources Conservation Act appraisals, Resources Planning
Act assessments, national forest planning, USFS and BLM land use
and allotment planning, and environmental assessments should be
based on the analysis of multiple ecological attributes.
<LI>Basic data on soil surface conditions, erosion rates, plant
composition, and biomass production assembled and used to assess
rangelands should be made available to the public and the scientific
community for independent review.
<LI>USDA-NRCS, USFS, and BLM should continue current and ongoing
range condition and ecological status ratings while the transition
to rangeland health assessment is made.
</OL>

Rangelands</I> is available for $26.00 from the National Academy

<B><DT>Summary</B>
<DD></DL><UL> <LI>Cool-season annual grass<LI>
Native to Europe, naturalized in California<LI>
Commercial cv is 'Blando'<LI>
Height 8-31"<LI>
Flowers April-July<LI>
Biomass 9,500 lb/a<LI>
N content about 1.9% at heading<LI>
Among the best grass pollens for sustaining longevity and fecundity of the predatory mite Euseius tularensis<LI>
Often used in self-reseeding orchard and vineyard cover crops, in mixes with vetches, medics, and clovers.<LI>
Prone to lodge, not a good supporter for woollypod vetch</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding rates include 5-10 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989) and 6 lbs/acre (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Slayback (pers. comm.) suggested that if broadcast 6 lbs/acre suffices; if drilled, 4 lbs/acre.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The variety mainly used is 'Blando' brome (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Soft chess needs at least 12" annual rainfall (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Best on soils around pH 7.0 (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Soft chess does well on sandy loam to clay loam soils with good drainage (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Will grow on coarse to fine textured soils with good drainage (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Soft chess does best in full sun (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Soft chess is an annual grass (McLeod, 1982; Slayback, pers. comm.) and is regarded as one of the most reliable reseeding winter annuals available (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Flowering occurs from April to July (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seeding depth should be 1/2 inch (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Preferred seeding method is to drill, but broadcasting and harrowing is feasible (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Glenn McGourty established soft chess and other cover crops in vineyards by discing twice to prepare the seedbed, broadcasting seed, cultipacking, and immediately applying 1 inch of water by sprinkler irrigating (Bugg et al., unpublished).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Seeding dates from September through October are optimum (Slayback, pers. comm.), but fall to early winter can also suffice (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>No inoculation is required because this is a grass (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed cost is variable, but was $3.00 to $3.50/lb.  after the 1988 harvest (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price for cv 'Blando' as $2.87/lb in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed production is good in California, and seed is readily available (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Seed production ranges from 800 to 1200 lbs/acre (Slayback, pers. comm.), and seed can be produced even under intensive clipping if the mower is not lower than 2 to 4 inches (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Early clipping (presumably during winter) promotes tillering and can increase seed production by 30% (Love and Eckert, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Soft chess stores well.  Percent of germinable seed should be assessed after 5 years (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Suberect (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Slayback, pers. comm.) to erect (Slayback, pers. comm.) growth habit.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>'Blando' brome attains up to 30 inches on good site (Slayback, pers. comm.), and Munz (1973) wrote that soft chess reaches heights of 20-80 cm, but in a replicated study (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991, cv 'Blando' was measured at 100.97+/-2.17 cm (39.75 +/- 0.85 inches), Mean +/- S.E.M.  (Bugg et al., unpublished data). This vineyard was on highly fertile alluvial soil.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Soft chess has a dense, fibrous root system (McLeod, 1982; Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>'Blando' has strong seedling vigor and reseeds if allowed to mature (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Soft chess can be mowed during the growing season to a height of 4".  Stop mowing during March or April to allow seed maturation during April or May (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> Soft chess can be clipped repeatedly during the growing season, but stop during late March or early April to allow recovery and seed maturation in late April.  If mowed no lower than 3 inches. just prior to maturity, some reseeding will take place.  To reduce frost threat, it can be clipped at 2 inches without damaging the stand (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Soft chess can be uses as a cover crop, annual range grass, for erosion control on dryland slopes, or food or cover and nesting habitat for wildlife (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> This is probably the most adaptable annual grass where winter cover alone is required and is suitable for nontillage systems or where winter cover is alternated with summer fallow or volunteer summer annuals.  It is recommended for orchards and vineyards with non-tillage systems, both with frequent clipping and infrequent clipping (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> Soft chess does not produce much biomass and, therefore, is a viable option for raisin, almond, and walnut growers who need refuse-free drive rows (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>McKenry (pers. comm.) reported that 'Blando' brome may sustain development of some <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B> but is generally not a host to <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp.  It does not appear to host <I>M.  hapla</I></B>, whereas many legumes do.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Seed matures about April 15 to May 1 (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Introduced from Europe, this grass is a common weed in waste places (Munz, 1973).  Hitchcock (1971) stated that it is common in Canada, Alaska, and along the Pacific Coast, and occurs occasionally east to Nova Scotia and south to North Carolina.  In California it is adapted to all climatic conditions below 3,000 feet (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>The species shows strong seedling vigor (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Above-ground dry biomass of 'Blando' brome was 9.45 +/- 1.44 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) in a replicated trial (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991 (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  This is significantly less than biomass obtained for barley ('U.C.  476'). With weeds included, the dry biomass in plots sown to 'Blando' was 9.870+/-1.634 Mg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>'Blando' brome is good at reseeding itself (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Christensen (1971) wrote that for Californian vineyards, French plowing would leave a narrow strip of cover crops in each alley, and would permit use of early-maturing species like brome grass. Dates for plowing down cover crops depend on the maturation dates: Early May is appropriate for brome grass.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Soft chess <I>Bromus mollis</I></B> suppresses broad-leaf filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I></B>) by shading more effectively under conditions of adequate sulfur. When sulfur is limited, broad-leaf filaree tends to get access to it sooner because of more rapid extension of its young roots (McCown and Williams, 1968).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>;Soft chess can be used in mixtures with reseeding legumes, including rose clover and 'Lana' woollypod vetch (Slayback, pers. comm.).  <I>Bromus mollis</I></B> shades out broad-leaf filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I></B>) more effectively with adequate sulfur. When sulfur is limited, broad-leaf filaree assimilates it sooner because of more rapid extension of its young roots (McCown and Williams, 1968).<P> Christensen (1971) suggested winter cover crops for Californian vineyards, with the aim of producing a sod-like condition.  Cover crops would be low growing, require little or no mowing, and be self re-seeding.  Their functions would be to reduce tillage and dust, provide habitat for predators that attack spider mites, improve water penetration, and provide nitrogen.  Annual grasses suggested include barley, 'Blando' brome, or cereal rye. Subterranean clovers recommended include cv 'Geraldton', Dwalganup', 'Howard', and 'Mt.  Barker'. Rose clovers included cv 'Kondinin' and 'Hykon'.  Medics suggested were California bur clover, Cyprus barrel medic, and 'Harbinger' barrel medic. Mixtures of subterranean clovers were suggested so that better adapted varieties will reseed.<P> As noted by Blake (1991), cover crops managed without tillage may be important in reducing rill and sheet erosion from hillside vineyards, which if uncontrolled can lead to soil losses of as much as 14 tons/a annually.  Mowed 'Blando' brome, 'Zorro' fescue, and resident vegetation were compared to tillage in vineyards on various soils.  Shallow clayey soils may predispose for water stress caused by no-till cover crops.  On the other hand, cover crops may improve soil porosity in the upper 16" and thereby enhance water availability in deeper soils to a depth of 3 feet. Mowed cover plots were dominated by annual grasses by a ratio of 2:1 over forbs, whereas the reverse was true in tilled vineyard plots.  The preponderance of deep-taprooted forbs may explain water depletion in tilled plots.  On the shallow clay site, early mowing of 'Zorro' fescue plots may have enabled invasion by a more vigorous annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium temulentum</I></B>), which may have led to increased water depletion.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Weed above-ground dry biomass in plots seeded to 'Blando' soft chess at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 15-16, 1991, was 0.420+/-0.215 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M, which is 8.54% of the weed biomass in control plots. Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and an annual ryegrass (probably darnel, <I>Lolium temulentum</I></B> L.).  Vegetational cover by 'Blando' brome was 92.50+/-1.44% (Mean +/- S.E.M.) in early May (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> <I>Bromus mollis</I></B> shades out broad-leaf filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I></B>) by shading more effectively under conditions of adequate sulfur. When sulfur is limited, broad-leaf filaree assimilates it sooner because of more rapid extension of its young roots (McCown and Williams, 1968).<P> Blake (1991) noted that cover crops managed without tillage may be important in reducing rill and sheet erosion from hillside vineyards, which if uncontrolled can lead to soil losses of as much as 14 tons/a annually.

On the shallow clay site, early mowing of 'Zorro' fescue plots may have enabled invasion by a more vigorous annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium temulentum</I></B>), which may have led to increased water stress.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Blando brome is not a legume and makes no net nitrogen contribution (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Wind-blown pollen serves as an alternate food for the arbored predatory mite <I>Euseius tularensis</I></B> (Ouyang et al., 1992). 'Blando' brome occasionally harbors grain aphids, associated beneficial insects (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>As noted by Blake (1991), cover crops managed without tillage may be important in reducing rill and sheet erosion from hillside vineyards, which if uncontrolled can lead to soil losses of as much as 14 tons/a annually.

<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>'Blando' brome mproves soil tilth if incorporated or mowed. (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> As noted by Blake (1991), cover crops managed without tillage may be important in reducing rill and sheet erosion from hillside vineyards, which if uncontrolled can lead to soil losses of as much as 14 tons/a annually.

<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Glumes broad, obtuse, coarsely pilose or scabrous-pubescent, the first 3- to 5-nerved, 4-6 mm long, the second 5- to 7- nerved, 7-8 mm long; lemmas broad, soft, obtuse, 7-nerved, coarsely pilose of scabrous-pubescent, rather deeply bidentate, 8 to 9 mm long, the margin and apex hyaline; awn rather stout, 6-9 mm long; palea amout three-fourths as long as lemma (Hitchcock, 1971).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Softly pubescent throughout. culms erect, 20-80 cm tall; panicle erect, contracted, 5-10 cmm long, or, in depauperate plants, reduced to a few spikelets (Hitchcock, 1971).<P> Annual, sheaths retrorse-pubescent; blades mostly 2-5 mm wide (Munz, 1973).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>

<DD>A three-year field study of strawberry (<I>Frageria X ananassa</I></B> Duchesne Rosaceae; cv 'Sparkle' and 'Honeoye') showed that living mulches of wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.), Kentucky bluegrass (<I>Poa pratensis</I></B> L.), or perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) reduced soil compaction (Newenhouse and Dana, 1989).<P>

<DD>Newenhouse and Dana (1989) described a three-year field study of strawberry (<I>Frageria X ananassa</I></B> Duchesne Rosaceae; cv 'Sparkle' and 'Honeoye'). Living mulches of wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.), Kentucky bluegrass (<I>Poa pratensis</I></B> L.), or perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) provided protection from winter storms and, thereby, improved fruit yield and quality. When snow covered the strawberry plants, living mulches did not enhance yield or quality.  When wind damaged blossoms, yields were better in plots with living mulches.  When no such damage occurred, yields did not differ.  Perennial ryegrass, which spreads by tillering but did not invade the strawberry rows, and which grows tall enough to provide wind protection, appeared the best living mulch tested.<P>

<H1>SAREP Project Update:  Postharvest Handling</H1>
<P>

</I>
<P>
<B>Marita Cantwell de Trejo</B>, UC Davis Extension vegetable
crops specialist, heads a SAREP project on postharvest handling
of tomatoes and melons using hot water, hot air, and high carbon
dioxide regimes to control postharvest pathogens.<BR>
<P>
Cantwell de Trejo's preliminary work (1989) identified the time-temperature
ranges for forced warm air which are effective in controlling
pathogen growth on inoculated fruit without causing visible fruit
injury and other quality losses (especially firmness and flavor
in tomatoes.)  An example of an effective treatment for tomatoes
was determined to be 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) for two hours
in non-humidified air.<BR>
<P>
Since 1990, the first year of the SAREP project, the focus has
been on hot water treatments as alternatives to postharvest use
of fungicides on fresh market tomatoes and cantaloupe melons.
 Tomatoes were inoculated with <I>Botrytis cinerea </I>and treated
with hot water.  Cantaloupes were inoculated with <I>Fusarium
roseum </I>and treated similarly.  To date the project has identified
the limits of tolerance of the tomatoes and cantaloupes to hot
water treatments.  &quot;An effective treatment is considered
to be one that will stop the fungus dead in its tracks, i.e. there
will be no fungal growth or decay development,&quot; Cantwell
de Trejo said. Several hot water time-temperature regimes provided
effective pathogen control without causing visible fruit injury.
 Heat treatments effective in controlling <I>Botrytis </I>were
also effective in controlling other common postharvest pathogens.
 Although several regimes can efficiently control postharvest
pathogens for each fruit, only a few treatments resulted in fruit
of quality equal to that of untreated fruits, Cantwell de Trejo
said.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Generally, higher-temperature, shorter-duration treatment
regimes had the least impact on fruit quality,&quot; she said.
 Cantwell de Trejo said the hot water treatments found to be most
effective for tomatoes to date are:  treated at 58 degrees C (136
degrees F) for three minutes; 55 degrees C (131 degrees F) for
seven minutes; 53 C (127 degrees F) for ten minutes (although
it softens the fruit too much).<BR>
<P>
Surface decay is the worst cantaloupe postharvest problem, Cantwell
de Trejo said.  Both fruit surface and stem-end decay were evaluated
during the experiments.  Lower temperatures for longer time periods
(50<I> </I>C for ten minutes) control pathogens better, but reduce
fruit quality in comparison to shorter-term treatments.
<P>
Other effective treatments include 57 degrees C for 2.5 to 3.5
minutes.<BR>
<P>
&quot;We're looking at ways to improve the higher-temperature/shorter-term
treatments,&quot; she said, adding that off-flavor problems could
result from the longer, lower temperature treatments.<BR>
<P>
Cantwell de Trejo said the principal benefit of hot water (or
air) treatments is that they can kill the organisms on and below
the fruit surface.  &quot;Postharvest fungicides only kill surface
pathogens,&quot; she said. She said the heat may affect ripening
behavior by slowing it, which could be good or bad.  Heat treatments
are currently used as quarantine treatments for imported crops
like papayas and mangoes.<BR>
<P>
&quot;The hot water treatments could be used in the future for
quarantines if this is ever necessary,&quot; she said. &quot;This
is a side benefit that could result from our work if we know exactly
how these heat regimes work.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Cantwell de Trejo said her research group will be testing the
effects of modified atmospheres on the postharvest condition of
fruit in 1991.  Researchers will be testing high C0<FONT SIZE=2>2
on fruits, both alone and in combined treatments with hot air
or hot water, she said.  Investigators include <B>Xunli Nie</B>,
UC Davis vegetable crops, and <B>Noel Sommer</B>, UC Davis pomology.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
&quot;We have tried hot water on honeydew melons and observed
some benefit with pathogen control in longer-term storage, for
more than three weeks,&quot; she said.  &quot;Lately we've also
been playing around with onions.  It looks like hot water might
be an effective treatment to control pathogens like <I>Aspergillus.
 </I>There are other crops that could potentially use this treatment.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
She said that research during the second year will also focus
on the application of these techniques on a semi-commercial scale.
 Tests comparing the heat treatment with commercially applied
fungicides will be part of the evaluation.<BR>
<P>
In addition to controlling temperature and relative humidity and
modifying atmospheres, Cantwell de Trejo said that avoiding physical
damage to the crops is critical to the maintenance of quality.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Putting masking tape over fingernails, avoiding drops of
the crop, these are not 'sexy' topics, but they are basic common
sense strategies for avoiding postharvest problems,&quot; she
said.  &quot;Generally, if proper postharvest techniques are used,
few crops require additional treatments such as fungicides or
hot air.&quot;<BR>

<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is similar in appearance to rose clover but is a taller, more erect plant (Miller et al., 1989).<P> The showy crimson flower also distinguishes the crimson clover plant (Murphy et al., 1976; Finch and Sharp, 1983).  The light-green foliage is covered with soft hairs; the leaves are usually unmarked but sometimes have a few dark-red spots; the plant branches less than does rose clover, and can grow to 1.5 ft. in height (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Crimson clover flowers are self fertile but not self pollinating (Knight, 1985; Knight and Hoveland, 1985).  Flowers produce much nectar and are heavily visited by various types of bees (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Crimson clover was considered early maturing by Finch and Sharp (1983), and will set seed by late May (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Miller et al. 1989).<P> Cv 'Flame' matures 2 weeks earlier than 'Dixie' (Baltensperger et al., 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Crimson clover shows good seedling vigor according to Slayback (pers. comm.).<P> Williams (1956) noted that during establishment the force produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the weight of overlying soil and surface crusts.  Using glass tubes containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass, the force produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean clover, and alfalfa was estimated.  Mean forces exerted (in g, + SEM) were estimated as follows.  Alfalfa: 15.2 +/- 0.5 g; crimson clover: 23.8 +/- 0.2; rose clover 24.1 +/- 0.5; subterranean clover 60.0 +/- 2.9.  The force exerted by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight, but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting that other factors may operate as well.<P> Williams (1963) conducted further studies on the penetrating force of emerging seedlings, which can be important in overcoming soil crusts and compaction and excessively-deep seeding.  Crimson clover varieties showed great variability in the amount of force exerted by seedlings.  'Autauga' F.C. 32, 963 and Mississippi selection F.C.  32, 964 showed particularly great forces.  These greatly exceeded those of rose clover, 'Caliverde' and 'Ranger' alfalfa, and 'Kenland' red clover.  Forces exerted by crimson clover and alfalfa were highly dependent on temperature, with the maximum force attained for the former near 20o C, and for the latter between 25 and 30o C.  These patterns suggest that plantings could be timed to achieve best emergence of seedlings.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is tolerant of alkaline soils and of a pH range of 4.8-8.2, with the mean of 26 cases being 6.5 (Duke, 1981). Slayback (pers. comm.) suggested a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. Crimson clover is intolerant of poorly-drained calcareous soils (Knight and Hoveland, 1985), and muck or extremely acid soils do not support good growth (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Crimson clover requires rhizobial inoculant type "R" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Crimson clover seed availability is fair to good (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is a stout, soft-pubescent annual legumes; stems are erect (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Crimson clover can grow to 18 inces in height (Murphy et al. 1976) or, according to Finch and Sharp (1983), to between 12 and 16 inches.  Height of cv 'Flame' grown in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, was 48.90+/-15.77 cm (19.25 +/- 6.21 inches) (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), crimson clover is native to Atlantic and southern Europe, Caucasus and Transcaucasus.  Knight and Hoveland (1985) maintain that it is native to southern Europe. It is assigned to the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian Centers of Diversity, is grown from the subtropical through cool temperate regions, and ranges from the Boreal Wet through Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zones (Duke, 1981).  In Europe, it was cultivated for forage and green manure during the 18th century (Knight, 1985).<P> Crimson clover appears well-adapted to the predominant climatic conditions of the southeastern USA (Hargrove, 1986), and it tolerates a wide range of climatic and soil conditions (Knight, 1985).<P> Although Finch and Sharp (1983) stated that crimson clover is adapted to the same conditions as rose clover, Murphy et al. (1976) maintained that the former is not adapted over so wide a range of conditions.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that crimson clover hay yields average from 4.5-5.0 Mg/ha, with yields as high as 7.5 Mg/ha on exceptional soils.  Based on Duke's (1981) report of 16.7% N on a dry-matter basis, and the assumption that 6.5% of this is N, these biomass yields project to N contents of 48.85-54.28 kg N/ha with peak values of 81.41 kg N/ha.  Above-ground biomass data from Hopland, Mendocino County, California, collected by Bugg et al. (Unpublished data) project to 91.79 +/- 16.03 kg N/ha (cv 'Flame'). Studies in Georgia by Hargrove (1982), during 1976-77, showed that for fluted coulter planted corn following crimson clover no response was obtained to an additional 105 lbs of N/acre.  Crimson clover dry matter production averaged 3,364 lbs/acre/yr, and the tissue contained 71 lbs of nitrogen/acre/yr. Hargrove (1982) calculated that based on dry matter tields and N content: 1.1 tons/acre at 2.4% translated to 53 lbs N/acre. Hargrove (1986) later found that crimson clover can replace as much as 120 kg fertilizer N/ha (no-till grain sorghum trials in Georgia) although the mean N content of three year field trial in Georgia was 170 kg/ha.  In terms of total N content, crimson clover tended to be superior to other leguminous cover crops due to its large dry matter production.  The mean N content of crimson clover was significantly greater than that of subterranean clover and common vetch but not significantly greater than that of hairy vetch (Hargrove, 1986).<P> Smith et al.  (1987) summarized aboveground nitrogen contents (kg/ha) obtained in individual studies as: 133, 56, 170. Proportion of nitrogen estimated obtained from fixation were given as: 0.79, 0.36, 0.78.  Estimated N fertilizer equvalences under no-tillage regimes were given (kg/ha): followed by cotton - 34-67, 68; followed by corn - 67, 50 or less, 100,19-128; followed by sorghum - 89 or less, 50 - 128.<P> Smith et al.  (1987) also gave aboveground nitrogen contents (kg/ha) obtained in mixture with rye as 147, with the proportion of nitrogen estimated obtained from fixation being 0.69. Proportion of nitrogen accumulated in roots was given as 0.12.<P> In a study of corn and sorghum production in Georgia by McVay et al.  (1989), crimson clover had an above-ground N-content of 108 kg/ha and replaced 99 kg/ha of N.  Bermuda grass grown following crimson clover receives 120-240 kg/ha of N from crimson clover residue (Knight and Hoveland, 1985). Crimson clover can provide 75 to 100 kg/ha of N to succeeding corn.  (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that crimson clover hay yields average from 4.5-5.0 Mg/ha, with yields as high as 7.5 Mg/ha on exceptional soils.  Smith et al. (1987.) summarized dry matter yields (Mg/ha) obtained in individual studies: 2.4, 4.5, 5.0, 5.3, 6.7, 3.2. Hargrove (1982) reported that dry matter production averaged 3,364 lbs/acre/yr., but mean dry weight of three year field trial in Georgia was 7.17 Mg/ha, exceeding production of of other cover crops (Hargrove.  1986).  On a high-fertility site in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, dry above-ground biomass of cv 'Flame' was 8.456+/-1.477 Mg/ha, Mean +/-S.E.M.; when weeds were included, biomass was 9.063+/-1.540 Mg/ha, (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Clover dry matter production averaged 3,364 lbs/acre/yr., and the tissue contained 5 lbs of P/acre and 90 lbs of K/acre (Hargrove, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is more tolerant of <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp.  than are red, white, or arrowleaf clovers (Quesenberry et al., 1986), but Duke (1981) listed 19 types of plant-parasitic nematodes that have been isolated from the roots. McKenry (pers. comm.) has stated that crimson clover is a good host for <I>Meloidogyne hapla</I></B> and other <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Flowering is induced when daylength exceeds 12 hours (Knight, 1985).  In California, crimson clover flowers from May through August, according to Munz (1973).  Cvv 'Dixie' and 'Frontier' are among the earliest to head out and set seed (Morey and Marchant, 1977), but cv 'Flame' flowers still earlier (about 2 weeks) (Baltensperger et al., 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Flowers of crimson clover are attractive to bees (Pears et al., 1989).<P> In California, crimson clover flowers contain abundant minute pirate bug (<I>Orius tristicolor</I></B>), an important beneficial insect that preys on various agricultural pests (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In southern Georgia, crimson clover was found to sustain pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> [Harris]) and blue alfalfa aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B> Shinji) which do not attack pecans. They were found along with associated predators that can disperse to pecan trees and attack pecan aphids. Crimson clover is being used by some pecan growers in efforts to enhance early-season biological control of pecan aphids (Bugg et al., 1990a).<P> House and Alzugaray (1989) reported that hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B> Roth) sustained higher densities of above-ground arthropods and a more taxonomically-diverse entomofauna than did crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L.) or wheat (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.).  Soil arthropods were more diverse under no-tillage than under tillage.  Pest and beneficial soil arthropods were most abundant in no-tillage corn preceded by hairy vetch. Differences that were apparent early had dissipated by midseason.<P> Bugg et al.  (1991a) reported on a study in southern Georgia on cool- season cover crops relay intercropped with spring plantings of cantaloupe (<I>Cucumis melo</I></B> L.  var.  <I>reticulatus</I></B> Seringe) in efforts to enhance biological control of insect pests on the latter.  Eight cover-crop regimes were tested in a replicated trial: (1) A hybrid vetch, <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L. X <I>V. cordata</I></B> Wulf (Fabaceae, cv 'Vantage'); (2) Common lentil, <I>Lens culinaris</I></B> L.  (Fabaceae, cv 'Chilean 78'); (3) Subterranean clover, <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L.  (Fabaceae, cv 'Mt.  Barker'); (4) Crimson clover, <I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L. (Fabaceae, cv 'Dixie'); (5) Rye, <I>Secale cereale</I></B> L. (Poaceae, cv 'Wrens Abruzzi'); (6) Mustard, <I>Brassica hirta</I></B> Moench (Brassicaceae, cv 'Florida Broadleaf'); (7) Polyculture of the six crops just mentioned; and (8) A control which received no seeds but was otherwise treated similarly to other regimes. Significant differences due to cover crop were obtained for densities of the generalist predator <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) (a bigeyed bug) amid cover crops, their residues, or weeds; on or near cantaloupe plants; and on or near sentinel egg masses of fall armyworm, <I>Spodoptera furgiperda</I></B> (J.  E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) pinned to cantaloupe leaves.  No significant effect due to cover crop was found for proportions of of egg masses occupied or damaged by predators.  In all four cases, absolute responses were highest for the plots of subterranean clover.  Among those regimes attaining good stands of cover crops, numbers of <I>G. punctipes</I></B> per sentinel egg mass were significantly greater for the subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, polyculture but not than TVantageU vetch. Rye was particularly poor habitat for <I>G.  punctipes</I></B>.<P> Bugg et al.  (1990a) reported on a trial in southern Georgia that concerned 20 cover-cropping regimes and associated insects. Convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville]) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) first were found in substantial numbers on rye, then on crimson clover (which harbored pea aphid [<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> {Harris}]) and lentil, later on subterranean clover, still later on narrow-leafed lupin, then hairy vetch, and lastly on mustard and collard. <I>Lygus</I></B> spp., which are important pests of field, row, and orchard crops, were exceptionally abundant on 'Cahaba White' and 'Vantage' vetches; both feature stipular extrafloral nectaries at which <I>Lygus</I></B> frequently fed. <I>Lygus</I></B> were also abundant on hairy vetch (monoculture and biculture) and to a lesser extent on turnip and monocultural crimson clover but were notably scarce on subterranean clover.<P> Field trials in southern Georgia by Bugg et al.  (1990b) indicated that during April and early May <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) (tarnished plant bug) attained relatively-high densities on the hybrid vetch (cvv 'Cahaba White' or 'Vantage'), lower levels on crimson clover and lentil, and particularly-low densities on 'Mt.  Barker' subterranean clover. Low densities were also obtained on 10 other varieties of subterranean clover. Late-instar and adult tarnished plant bug lived longer when caged on crimson clover than on hybrid vetch, which in turn supported better survival than did subterranean clover.  When adults of tarnished plant bug were caged on hybrid vetch or subterranean clover with or without floral and fruiting structures, there was no evidence that the presence of these structures prolonged tarnished plant bug survival on either crop. In choice tests with flowering and fruiting sprigs of three cover crops, tarnished plant bug preferred crimson clover over hybrid vetch, which in turn was more attractive than subterranean clover.  When sprigs were presented after reproductive structures had been excised, there was no statistically-significant preference by tarnished plant bug.  Results of the survival and choice experiments do not explain why tarnished plant bug was typically more abundant on hybrid vetches than on crimson clover. Early-instar tarnished plant bug nymphs may find the extrafloral nectar of the vetches more accessible than the floral nectar of crimson clover.  Such an effect on early-instar nymphs could have led to the observed differences in densities.  Subterranean clovers appear to provide both a less-attractive and less-favorable habitat for <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) than either crimson clover or the hybrid vetches. Preferred use of subterranean clovers in rotation or as interplants might reduce tarnished plant bug in agroecosystems.<P> In a replicated trial in North Carolina, House (1989) reported that corn was grown following no-till or conventionally-tilled winter cover crops of hairy vetch, crimson clover, or wheat. Hairy vetch harbored a more abundant and diverse below-ground arthropod fauna (herbivores and predators) than did crimson clover or wheat. Elateridae, Curculionidae, and Carabidae were particularly abundant following no-till hairy vetch. Scarabaeidae  were especially abundant  following conventionally-tilled clover.  Elateridae (wireworms) were the dominant herbivores in no-till systems. Observed faunal differences had dissipated by July.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the following as reseeding varieties of crimson clover: 'Dixie,' 'Auburn,' 'Chief,' and 'Talladega,' and 'Tibbee;' 'Frontier' is a soft-seeded variety.  According to Knight (1985), five named reseeding cultivars have been used: 'Dixie,' 'Auburn,' 'Autauga,' 'Chief,' and 'Talladega;' the first three are mature about a week earlier than the last two. Cv 'Flame' has a higher proportion of hard seed, matures earlier, and produced more biomass than 'Dixie' (Baltensperger et al., 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Crimson clover varieties that reseed include 'Dixie,' 'Auburn,' 'Chief,' and 'Talladega,' and 'Tibbee' (Duke, 1981; Knight, 1985). The first three are mature about a week earlier than the last two (Knight, 1985).  'Frontier' is a soft-seeded variety (Duke, 1981). Hardseededness is a character that avoids premature germination and ensures self-reseeding; among varieties of crimson clover, hardseededness can vary from 30-75% (Knight, 1985).  Cv 'Flame' shows better biomass production, earlier maturation, higher percentage of hard seed, and better stand persistence than do the cultivars previously named (Baltensperger et al., 1987).  Liming and additions of P and K may be needed to maintain productive stands (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Seed may be combined from standing plants, mowed and swathed or windrowed to dry, and then hulled or threshed with either a combine or stationary machines (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>White and Worsham (1990) evaluated eight herbicide treatments for hairy vetch and another eight for crimson clover under no-till management preceding corn and cotton.  Preceding cotton, the treatments were: (1) Paraquat, (2) Paraquat + 2,4-D, (3) Paraquat +cyanazine, (4) Glyphosate, (5) Glyphosate + 2,4-D, (6) Glyphosate + cyanazine, (7) 2,4-D, (8) Cyanazine.  Preceding corn, the treatments were (1) Paraquat, (2) Paraquat + 2,4-D, (3) Paraquat + dicamba, (4) Glyphosate, (5) Glyphosate + 2,4-D, (6) Glyphosate + dicamba, (7) 2,4-D, (8) Dicamba.  Paraquat alone of in combination with dicamba, 2,4-D or cyanazine, and cyanazine alone were the best controls for crimson clover. Glyphosate alone was relatively ineffective at controlling hairy vetch in corn; all other treatments were effective against hairy vetch in corn.  In cotton, the only treatments that worked well against hairy vetch were 2,4-D or cyanazine alone or combined with glyphosate.<P> Based on relay-intercropping trials in southern Georgia, crimson clover appears susceptible to glyphosate (Round-up) (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Paraquat (0.6 kg ai/ha) and HOE-39866 (0.8 kg ai/ha) gave control of crimson clover and hairy vetch regardless of the date of application (Griffin and Dabney, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Crimson clover seed cost is low (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price as $1.47/lb in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is said to be tolerant of weeds (Duke, 1981)<P> Weed above-ground biomass in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Hopland, Mendocino County, California on May 15-16, 1991, for cv 'Flame' was 0.607+/-0.153 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.), which was 12.34% of the weed biomass attained in control plots. Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  In early May, vegetational cover data by cv 'Flame' was 71.50+/-17.12 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data)<P> Purslane and water grass were difficult to control following no-till crimson clover in southern Georgia (relay intercropping with cantaloupe) (Bugg, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Crimson Clover has about 330,000 seeds/kg (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).<P> Hardseededness is a character that reduces the chance of premature germination and ensures self-reseeding.  Among varieties of crimson clover, hardseededness can vary from 30-75% (Knight, 1985).<P> Five named reseeding cultivars have been used: 'Dixie,' 'Auburn,' 'Autauga,' 'Chief,' and 'Talladega.' The first three are mature about a week earlier than the last two (Knight, 1985).<P> 'Flame' has a higher proportion of hard seed than 'Dixie' (Baltensperger et al., 1987).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Crimson clover tolerates a wide range of soil conditions (Knight, 1985) but does not do well on calcareous soils or with poor drainage (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).  Duke (1981) wrote that crimson clover or varieties thereof are noted for tolerance of high pH, heavy soil, and sand, thriving on sand or clay soils, so long as drainage is good.  McLeod (1982) stated that the species will grow on almost any soil, provided it is well-drained, but said that best growth occurs on loam soils with a good humus content.  Soils that are cold or waterlogged during the winter are not suitable (Duke, 1981) nor are muck or extremely acid soils (McLeod, 1982). Other recommendations on suitable soil types include: sandy loam to clay loam (Slayback, pers. comm.), clay or sandy soil (Murphy et al., 1976; Knight and Hoveland, 1985); and Ultisols (Hargrove, 1986).  Pears et al.  (1989) stated that crimson clover appears well-adapted to on sandy loam soils and does not do well on heavy soils.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Crimson clover can be overseeded into existing grass sod, but grass must be mowed closely to allow seedlings to establish. Light disking can also reduce competition by grasses (Knight, 1985).<P> As detailed by Knight (1985), crimson clover can be grown in conjunction with rye, vetches, annual ryegrass, and various cereals.  When sown in combination with companion crops, crimson clover is usually sown at 2/3 the normal rate, and the other crop at 1/3 the monocultural rate.  Developmental rates of annual ryegrass and tall fescue are similar to that of crimson clover.<P> Crimson clover can be grown in combination with cereal grains, annual ryegrass, and other winter annual legumes.  It can be established in existing stands of bermudagrass, dallisgrass, johnsongrass, bahiagrass, or sericea lespedeza (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).  In Georgia, crimson clover can be a self-reseeding cover crop in pecan, peach, and other orchards (Knight, 1985). Crimson clover can be seeded with subclover or black medic (Finch and Sharp. 1983).<P> Williams (1963) evaluated pure plantings and in 1:1 bicultures of a S. Australian commercial strain of crimson clover, rose clover (<I>T.  hirtum</I></B> All., strain S.6), and subterranean clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I></B> L.  cv 'Bacchus').  Competition for light was assessed in relation to leaf area and leaf position in the canopy. Leaf area in 4-cm horizontal strata, leaf weight, shoot weight production, and light penetration through canopies were measured at intervals during the vegetative phase (i.e., through 99 days after sowing).  Crimson and rose clovers held apparent initial advantages over subterranean clover in terms of light-absorbing surface area of cotyledons and first unifoliate leaves and because these leaves were elevated further from the soil surface.  However, this situation changed with time.  In paired sowings, crimson and subterranean clover became equally dominant over rose clover, while subterranean clover overtopped crimson despite the greater total leaf area of the latter.  The most productive mixture (crimson clover + subterranean clover) was no more productive that the best species (crimson clover) in monoculture.  Competition has other dimensions than those reported here, including the advantage conferred by hardseededness of rose clover, which enables it to dominate polyspecific stands following droughts that kill seedlings of the other two clovers.<P> Subterranean clover has, on the average, larger seed than does crimson clover, and plot studies by Williams, Black, and Donald (1968) indicated that the former will tend to dominate in mixtures due to more rapid early growth and shading of the crimson clover. When larger seeds of crimson clover were selected and interseeded with smaller seeds of subterranean clover, the pattern was reversed.  Crimson clover was not eliminated from any of the mixtures evaluated.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is more resistant to diseases than are most alternative clovers (Baltensperger et al., 1987), and it is said to tolerate viral diseases (Duke, 1981).  However, July sowing of crimson clover can result in stand failure due to virus (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values (Zachariassen and Power, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values (Zachariassen and Power, 1991).<P> Compared to an adjacent area under conventional tillage management, soil organic carbon and organic nitrogen levels were much higher in no-till crimson clover winter cover crop plots at the conclusion of the study (Hargrove, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>The root system is simple, dominated by a taproot, and often well nodulated (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Normal mowers, combines, theshers, and tillage implements are appropriate in managing crimson clover; no expensive machinery is needed (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is an excellent pasture and hay crop (Duke, 1981).  Use in mixture with grass reduces the danger of bloat (Knight, 1985), which seldom occurs with crimson clover (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No specific information is available; the plant is very attractive to bees, which might annoy or sting workers (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>The common name is crimson clover (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982) or scarlet clover (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L.  (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Crimson clover cannot tolerate extreme heat or cold and grows best during the cool, humid weather that typifies the winter in mild climates (generally south of New Jersey) (McLeod, 1982).  It tolerates mean annual temperatures of from 5.9-21.3 degrees C, with the mean of 30 cases being 12.9 (Duke, 1981).  Seedlings require considerable heat in the early stages of growth (McLeod, 1982). Crimson clover should be established 6 weeks before the average date of the first frost (Knight, 1985).  Williams (1963) found that the forces exerted by crimson clover and alfalfa seedlings, which can be important in overcoming soil crusts, compaction, and excessively-deep seeding, were highly dependent on temperature, with the maximum force attained for crimson clover near 20o C, and for alfalfa between 25 and 30o C.  These patterns suggest that plantings could be timed to achieve best emergence of seedlings. In establishing crimson clover, moisture tended to be limiting through November 1, with temperature the critical consideration thereafter, until mid-February (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that seeding can occur from July until November, with early seeding being important in northern sectors. The aim of early sowing is to ensure that plants are well established before freezing weather occurs; frost heaving is especially damaging to young plants (Knight and Hoveland, 1985). In fact, crimson clover should be established 6 weeks before the average date of the first frost (Knight, 1985).  However, July sowing can result in stand failure due to virus (Knight, 1985).  In Mississippi, August 15 planting led to the highest yields (Knight, 1985).  In establishing crimson clover, moisture tended to be limiting through November 1, with temperature the critical consideration thereafter, until mid-February (Knight, 1985).<P> For California, fall seeding is suggested (Finch and Sharp, 1983). Slayback (pers. comm.) specified that September-October seeding dates are best and that spring sowing for summer production necessitates irrigation.  Spring seeding often results in stunting, poor flowering, and reduced seed yield (Duke, 1981).  Despite its natural winter-annual growth habit, in the Far North, crimson clover can be spring sown and grown as a summer crop, as is done in rotation with potatoes in Maine (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is the most important winter annual legume in the Southeast; it is excellent for pasture, hay, or green manure and at protecting the soil during winter and spring (Duke, 1981; and see McLeod, 1982)).  It can be winter grown as a green manure in rotation between milo and cotton, for example, or soybeans, small grain, and cotton (McLeod, 1982).<P> As recounted by Murphy et al. (1976), it is often used as a hay crop or for roadside plantings as well as for range seeding.  It is best suited for short-rotation planting, for use in a mixture with grains, or as a rotation crop with grains, and it is sometimes cut for hay.  The seedheads are easily accessible for use by grazing animals.<P> Crimson clover is a good green-manure crop for pecan and other orchard crops and can also be used in agroforestry, double-cropping, and no-till farming systems (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).<P> In Georgia, crimson clover can be a self-reseeding cover crop in pecan, peach, and other orchards (Knight, 1985).  In Alabama, it has been used to improve the soil for cotton (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) termed crimson clover a stout, soft-pubescent winter annual.  Seed should be sown from mid July until November, with early seeding more important in northern sectors; spring plantings usually result in stunting, poor flowering, and low seed yields (Duke, 1981).  Crimson clover grows in the winter but puts on most of its growth in the spring, maturing in May (Finch and Sharp, 1983).  Flowering is induced when daylength exceeds 12 hours (Knight, 1985).  The flowers are self fertile but not self pollinating (Knight, 1985; Knight and Hoveland, 1985), produce much nectar, and are heavily visited by various types of bees (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>For best results as a green manure, crimson clover should be plowed down 2-3 weeks before the succeeding crop; strip-tillage schemes are also used, whereby row crops are planted in the tilled strips and the crimson clover in the intervening strips allowed to produce seed for harvest and residue serves as mulch (Duke, 1981). McLeod (1982) stated that the residue decomposes rapidly when turned under.<P> House (1989) reported a replicated trial in which corn was grown following no-till or conventionally-tilled winter cover crops of hairy vetch, crimson clover, or wheat.  Hairy vetch harbored a more abundant and diverse below-ground arthropod fauna (herbivores and predators) than did crimson clover or wheat.  Elateridae, Curculionidae, and Carabidae were particularly abundant following no-till hairy vetch.  Scarabaeidae were especially abundant following conventionally-tilled crimson clover.  Elateridae (wireworms) were the dominant herbivores in no-till systems. Observed faunal differences had dissipated by July.<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>In establishing crimson clover, moisture tended to be limiting through November 1, with temperature the critical consideration thereafter, until mid-February (Knight, 1985).  It should be established 6 weeks before the average date of the first frost (Knight, 1985), but July sowing can result in stand failure due to virus (Knight, 1985).  For early sowing, frequent late summer and early fall rainfalls are required so the plants can get a good start (McLeod, 1982).  On the other hand, the species requires considerable heat in the early stages of growth (McLeod, 1982).<P> Crimson clover can be overseeded into existing grass sod, but grass must be mowed closely to allow seedlings to establish.  Light disking can also reduce competition by grasses (Knight, 1985).<P> During establishment, the force produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the weight of overlying soil and surface crusts.  Using glass tubes containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass, the force produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean clover, and alfalfa was estimated.  Mean forces exerted (in g, + SEM) were estimated as follows.  Alfalfa: 15.2 + 0.5 g; crimson clover: 23.8 + 0.2; rose clover 24.1 + 0.5; subterranean clover 60.0 + 2.9.  The force exerted by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting that other factors may operate, as well (Williams, 1956).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Crimson clover tolerates from 3.1-16.3 dm (12.2-64.2 inches) of annual precipitation, with the mean of 30 case being 9.2 Duke, (1981) and grows well in regions with 8.89 dm (35 inches) or more annual rainfall (McLeod, 1982).  It cannot endure much drought (McLeod, 1982) and likewise does not do well on poorly-drained soils (Duke, 1981; Knight and Hoveland, 1985).  Moist soil is essential for germination and establishment (McLeod, 1982).  In California, crimson clover will reseed only under excellent moisture conditions (Miller et al., 1989), i.e., with moisture at least throughout April (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> In establishing crimson clover, moisture tended to be limiting through November 1, with temperature the critical consideration thereafter, until mid-February (Knight, 1985).<P> Zachariassen and Power, (1991) found that crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweet clover showed intermediate values.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Crimson clover is adapted to soils of low fertility, and has an intermediate lime requirement; on infertile sites, phosphate and potash fertilizers and manure may increase production (McLeod, 1982).  A fall application of 200-400 kg/ha of 0:20:20 N:P:K fertilizer may suffice for two years on infertile sites (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Cccording to McLeod (1982), crimson clover withstands shade.  It is a self-reseeding component of understory cover crops in orchards and vineyards in California and in pecan orchards in southern Georgia.  This suggests some tolerance of shade (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Crimson clover can be overseeded into existing grass sod, but grass must be mowed closely to allow seedlings to establish.  Light disking can also reduce competition by grasses (Knight, 1985). Once established, crimson clover should be mowed no closer than 3 to 5 inches (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Miller et al. 1989), allowing 3 to 4 weeks regrowth before maturity (Finch and Sharp, 1983). Such mowing can improve growth (McLeod, 1982) and reduce lodging (Knight, 1985).<P> Crimson clover produces flowers at the ends of stems; therefore, grazing must be regulated to keep animals from removing all the flowers (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) suggested a firm seedbed (see: McLeod, 1982; Finch and Sharp, 1983) and broadcasting or drilling; drilling produces a better stand than broadcasting (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982).  If seed are drilled, spacing between plants should be about 2.5 cm (1 inch).  Natural, unhulled seed germinates better than hulled, according to McLeod (1982).<P> Crimson clover can be grown in combination with cereal grains, annual ryegrass, and other winter annual legumes.  It can also be established in existing stands of bermudagrass, dallisgrass, johnsongrass, bahiagrass, or sericea lespedeza (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).<P> Before overseeding into existing grass sod, grass must be mowed closely to allow seedlings to establish.  Light disking can also reduce competition by grasses (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Recommendations for sowing depth include 1/2 inch (McLeod, 1982), 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) on clay soils, and 2 cm (0.79 inch) on sandy soils (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates have been variously suggested as 9 lbs/acre (Finch and Sharp, 1983); 12-15 kg/ha (10.7-13.4 lbs/acre) (Duke, 1981); 15 to 20 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1989); 15-30 lbs/acre (McLeod, 1982); and 40-50 lbs/acre for unhulled seed (McLeod, 1982).<P> Crimson clover can be grown in conjunction with rye, vetches, annual ryegrass, and various cereals.  When sown in combination with companion crops, crimson clover is usually sown at 2/3 the normal rate, and the other crop at 1/3 the monocultural rate. Developmental rates of annual ryegrass and tall fescue are similar to that of crimson clover (Knight, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Crimson clover reseeds well when allowed to mature (McLeod, 1982).  This has been seen in in vineyards in Del Rey (east side of the southern San Joaquin Valley, California) (Masumoto, pers. comm.).<P> However, reseeding requires moisture at least through April, as recounted by Murphy et al. (1976).  The seedheads are easily accessible for use by grazing animals, and removal of all seed-producing heads must be prevented if reseeding is to be assured (Murphy et al. 1976).<P> Duke (1981) listed seed yields as commonly ranging from 340-410 kg/ha, with higher values on soils of intermediate as opposed to high fertility.  Maximum seed yields are in the range of 1,000-1,200 kg/ha (Knight and Hoveland, 1985).<P> According to Duke (1981), seed can be harvested in three ways: (1) combine standing plants; (2) mowed and left to swath or windrowed to dry and later threshed with a combine; or (3) mowed, swathed, or windrowed to dry, then hauled to a stationary huller or thresher. Hulls should be dark brown if seed is to be combined directly, light brown if mowed.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed has intermediate longevity (McLeod, 1982).<P>

<BR>
This research compared the soil properties and financial performance
of biodynamic and conventional farming systems over a four-year
period (1987 to 1991) on the North Island of New Zealand. The
comparisons were made among five pairs and two sets of farms of
varying size (16 farms total). A farm pair consisted of two side-by-side
farms, one biodynamic and one conventional; a farm set consisted
of three adjacent farms, one biodynamic and two conventional.
Representative farming enterprises in New Zealand were used: market
garden (vegetables), pip fruit (apples and pears), citrus, grain,
livestock (sheep and beef) and dairy. The combined data showed
that biodynamic farms had better soil quality than the neighboring
conventional farms (Table 1). <BR>
<BR>
Reliable economic data from annual accounts were available for
11 of the 16 farms. Comparisons were made of the financial performance
of the biodynamic farms both with that of their conventional neighbors
and with that of the average representative conventional farm
in each region. In comparing the gross margins of these farms
(total farm income per hectare minus operating expenses per hectare),
one biodynamic farm was greater, two were lower and two were similar
to their conventional neighbors. The biodynamic farms usually
had less year-to-year variability in gross margin than did the
conventional farms. The biodynamic farms had lower total gross
margins (gross margin times the effective enterprise area of each
farm) than both their conventional neighbors and most of the conventional
farms in the region. This difference was largely due to the smaller
size and greater enterprise diversity of the biodynamic farms.
Gross margin provides a comparison of financial performance of
two farms under different management approaches, while total gross
margins show the financial return to each whole farm or to the
major farm enterprise. <BR>

<H1>Marketing fresh organic produce in Colorado supermarkets.
</H1>

<FONT SIZE=2>Final Report: Colorado Department of Agriculture/USDA,
Federal State Marketing Improvement Program. 1992<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's Note: Understanding the barriers to marketing organic
produce has been a constant challenge for the organic industry.
Much research has been conducted about sustainable and organic
production techniques, as well as consumer attitudes and demands
for organic produce. Yet, little research has focused on why it
has been so difficult to match supply and demand for organics,
and how to move organic produce successfully through the distribution
system. This study uncovers some of the structural and attitudinal
barriers that have kept the market system from functioning as
efficiently as it might for organic produce. Results of this study
suggest possible actions for farmers, supermarket produce managers,
corporate produce directors, government agencies, and others who
want to increase the availability of organic produce in their
communities.</I>
<H3>Approach and Hypotheses</H3>

<P>
This study was begun in the Fall of 1990, in the wake of the daminozide
(Alar) controversy, with the objective of identifying obstacles
and possible remedies to marketing fresh organic produce in Colorado
supermarkets.<BR>

<P>
The study hypothesized that there are three major limitations
within the marketing system that may contribute to organics failing
to thrive in supermarkets: high prices, low quality, and the decision-making
structures within supermarket chains. All three hypotheses were
studied simultaneously in one of Colorado's market areas: the
northern front range encompassing the cities of Fort Collins,
Boulder, Greeley, and Denver. The general approach of this study
is unique in that it viewed the entire marketing system as a whole,
from the point of production to the point of purchase.<BR>

<H3>Methodology</H3>

<P>
The three components of the marketing system-consumers, stores,
and farmers-were studied using surveys and personal interviews.
<BR>

<P>
Consumers' attitudes, perceptions and purchasing patterns were
determined through a mail survey to 1500 Colorado families representative
of the area. Responses to questions about acceptable price premiums
were used to construct demand curves for five specific organic
commodities: leaf lettuce, carrots, broccoli, russet potatoes,
and apples. The demand curves were used to generate the probability
of respondents buying organic fresh produce at each price premium.
<BR>

<P>
Conventional and organic produce were evaluated by an experienced
inspector in retail stores in the study area. Information was
recorded about the item's price, grade, and size. The inspector
also noted the nature of the produce display, methods used for
identifying organics at checkout, and quality/visual differences
between organic and conventional produce.<BR>

<P>
Finally, interviews were conducted with store-level produce managers,
corporate-level produce directors and farmers in the study area.
<BR>

<H3>Results and Analysis</H3>

<P>
<B>Consumer Survey</B>. The consumer survey found that 26 percent
of consumers purchased organic produce at least once every two
to three months, and 5 percent bought it at least once a week.
The main reasons people gave for buying organics were &quot;concern
about chemical residues&quot; (30%), personal and family health
(21%) and flavor (17%). Those who had not purchased organic produce
in the last year said their main reasons were lack of availability
(41%) and price
<P>
(34%).<BR>

<P>
When comparing organic and conventional produce, consumers rated
organic better in four attributes: free of chemical residues,
environmental impact, farm workers' health and safety and personal
health. They rated conventional produce better for one attribute:
price. About half of the respondents rated organic and conventional
the same for: appearance, freshness (in store), keeping qualities,
flavor and nutritional value. However, in another question, appearance
and availability were weak points for organic produce.<BR>

<P>
The demand schedules constructed for each of the five commodities
indicated that:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>about 50 percent of consumers were willing to pay more for
organic produce when the price was only 8 percent higher than
conventional produce;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>fewer than 25 percent of the consumers were willing to pay
more when the premium jumped to 24 percent;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>only 3 percent of consumers were willing to pay more when
the premium was 64 percent above conventional.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that supermarket
organic premiums are too high, since the average premium was above
60 percent for the organics inspected in this study. Premiums
varied considerably between commodities (from a low of 25 percent
for carrots to a high of 95 percent for lettuce) and by supermarket
chain. Premiums were similar within any particular chain, suggesting
that prices were determined by corporate policy, not at a store
level. From this analysis, the investigators conclude that organic
produce should not be priced at more than 33 percent above conventional.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Quality Comparisons</B>. Reports of the produce inspector showed
that organics rated better than conventional produce in 10 percent
of the observations, and conventional was better than organic
in 45 percent of the observations. Conventional and organics were
rated similarly in 45 percent of the observations. While investigating
the instances where organics were inferior, the study authors
found a statistically significant relationship between negative
attitudes of store produce managers and observed quality of produce.
A specific cause and effect relationship between these two variables
is identified (but not well- substantiated) in the report, i.e.,
the produce manager's attitude determined the quality of the organic
produce section.<BR>

<P>
The study also showed that in-store handling affected the quality
of the produce, and that separating organics into their own section
decreases demand. The small number of stores that had success
in selling organics mingled organics with regular produce. Most
of the organic commodities studied were pre-bagged as part of
the produce display, but this practice was also found to decrease
demand.<BR>

<P>
<B>Produce Manager Interviews</B>. Produce managers felt that
consumers were most concerned about price, and somewhat less concerned
about appearance and freshness. Out-of-store promotion and pricing
were left to the corporate offices. Prices appeared to be inflexible
and standardized by each supermarket chain. Stocking decisions
were based primarily on what was available at the corporate warehouses.
Several managers mentioned that the selection and quality of organics
at warehouses was poor. Some managers said they could probably
sell more organic produce if they could obtain it. Autonomy in
procurements and pricing contributed to successful marketing of
organics in supermarkets. Some stores had made arrangements with
their warehouses that allowed them to order some produce directly
from local farmers or suppliers.<BR>

<P>
<B>Corporate-Level Interviews</B>. Produce directors indicated
that organics comprised a very small volume compared with conventional
produce. They believed in the safety and healthfulness of the
conventional food supply. Thus, they thought that promoting organics
might imply that conventionally grown produce was in some way
inferior. At the same time, they also saw in organics an opportunity
to provide a product that the public apparently wanted. They acknowledged
however, that in providing organics, they did not provide informational
materials to their produce managers about organic food production.
Although the same grading standards were used in purchasing organic
and conventional produce, one director observed that the quality
of the organic produce was compromised by time lags in the distribution
chain, and the fact that only modest quantities were being distributed.
Handling small quantities of slow-moving, perishable, organic
produce is difficult for the warehouses.<BR>

<P>
<B>Organic Farmer Interviews</B>. Farmers indicated that they
thought consumers purchased organics mainly due to personal health
concerns, residue concerns and for better flavor. They felt that
consumers needed and wanted more information about organic food
production and that this information was an important point-of-purchase
marketing tool. Constraints mentioned by farmers to marketing
organic produce included: the lack of access to special equipment
such as hydrocooling and storage, and the inability to use some
post-harvest chemicals that retard spoilage. Farmers felt that
distributors were good outlets for their produce. Supermarkets
have tremendous potential but first, corporate-level directors
need to support organics, and second, price premiums need to be
reduced substantially. Many saw an opportunity for expanding their
sales through freezing and canning surplus produce.<BR>

<H1><U>Farmer Profile</U>: Porterville Farmers Make the Transition
</H1>
<P>
<I>by Robert Bugg SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
An<I> </I>increasing number of California farmers are making the
shift from what has been considered conventional agriculture,
to biologically-based farming systems. There were times when successful
organic farmers were accused of spraying synthetic pesticides
at night.  But data show that a growing number of farmers are
profitably using organic farming methods in California.
<H3>Family Operation</H3>
<P>
Two such farmers are <B>John </B>and<B> Cindy France</B>, a husband-and
wife team who operate a diversified farm in Porterville.  They
farm oranges, olives, prunes, Thompson Seedless grapes for juice,
Ruby Seedless table grapes, apricots, walnuts and row crops. 
In addition to raising seven perennial crops and three children,
they also operate France Spreading, a business devoted to spreading
fertilizers and bulk soil amendments (e.g., manure, compost, lime,
gypsum, and sulfur) for growers throughout Kern and Tulare Counties.
<BR>
<P>
Three years ago, the Frances began instituting major changes in
soil management. An incentive for the transition to biologically-based
farming was the looming likelihood of pesticide restrictions.
 Several of their spreading operation clients were successful
organic growers.  Other customers relied heavily on applications
of animal manures or compost, or used cover crops, while minimizing
most synthetic inputs.  The fact that various farmers were having
economic success with organic and transitional agriculture gave
credibility to these concepts, and inspired the Frances with confidence
that a transition would be possible.  (During the transition,
key information was provided by Ralph Jurgens of New Era Farm
Service, Tulare and Bob Cantisano of Organic Ag Advisors, Colfax.)
<H3>Switch to Compost</H3>
<P>
The first step in the conversion process was made partly out of
necessity:  the Frances switched from applying animal manure to
compost because of the scarcity of good-quality manure in 1986.
 Some consultants in the field of sustainable agriculture believe
that compost is a superior soil amendment because of the high
concentration of humus.  John points out that in a perfect soil
environment, manure would also break down to yield humus, but
that composting leads more reliably to formation of humus.  (Gershuny,
G. &amp; J. Smillie. 1986.  <I>The Soul of Soil:  A Guide to Ecological
Soil Management. </I>2nd edition.  GAIA Services, St. Johnsbury,
VT. 125 pp.)<BR>
<P>
The next major step, undertaken in 1989, was to begin cover cropping
in the orchards and vineyards.  In prunes, perennial clovers (Salina
strawberry and New Zealand white clovers) are used.  In the other
crops, a mix of winter annuals is used, including oats, hairy
vetch, common vetch, and Austrian winter pea.  These must be reseeded
each year.
<H3>Soil Organic Matter</H3>
<P>
Since the conversion began in 1986, laboratory tests have indicated
a dramatic rise in soil organic matter in all crops.  For example,
in the upper six inches of soil, organic matter has risen from
0.5<I> </I>to a high of 1.4 percent in the oranges, from 0.5 to
a high of 1.8 percent in prunes, and from 0.7 to a high of 1.9
percent in olives.  John attributes this rise mainly to the application
of compost, which has been underway for several years.  Most research
indicates that cover cropping alone does not lead to net gains
in soil organic matter (MacRae, R.J. &amp; G.R. Mehuys. 1985.
The Effect of Green Manuring on the Physical Properties of Temperate-Area
Soils. Advances in Soil Science. 3:71-94.)  However, cover crops
are used in vineyards to increase the uptake of irrigation water.
 This effect was a major incentive for the Frances, whose soils
were prone to crusting.  In fact, the improvement in water absorption
has been so great that in some cases it is difficult to get water
to the ends of the rows, John reports.<BR>
<H3>No Frost Damage</H3>
<P>
Frosts can be made worse in cover-cropped citrus groves, because
bare ground is better at storing solar heat and re-radiating this
heat on cold nights.  But frost has not proven to be a problem
for the Frances, although their navel orange trees are located
in a low-lying area.  The lack of frost damage probably relates
to the cover crop's late sowing date (November), which means that
it grows no more than a few inches high and covers only a low
proportion of the soil during the times of principal frost danger.
 The groves are tilled, which incorporates most prunings, leaving
more exposed soil.  The Frances also use furrow irrigation, which
enables them to apply substantial amounts of warm irrigation water
during times of frost.<BR>
<P>
One difficulty with the cover crop has been that the mixture of
oats, vetch, and Austrian winter pea has not supplied sufficient
nitrogen to the citrus, at least as currently managed.  The Frances
had record orange yields in 1990, but added supplemental synthetic
nitrogen fertilizer (50 pounds/acre as UN-32) because leaf-tissue
analyses indicated a nitrogen deficiency, and nitrogen would not
be as readily available from manure as from a synthetic source.
 This application has postponed organic certification of the oranges.
<BR>
<P>
An unexpected benefit of the cover crop may be the encouragement
of a predatory mite, <I>Euseius tularensis, </I>that has been
exceptionally abundant in the cover-cropped orange grove.  These
mites are important generalist predators of citrus pests, and
benefit from sources of windblown pollen that the oats in the
cover crop may have provided.  This question is now being addressed
by University of California researcher Beth Grafton-Cardwell,
Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier.
<H3>Record Harvest</H3>
<P>
In 1990, the Frances set all-time records for their farm in production
and quality for citrus (894 field boxes picked; 1,167 40-pound
cartons packed per acre, with excellent size, peaking in 72s and
88s) and Hartley walnuts (2.84 dry tons per acre, lots ranged
from 0-2.5 percent insect damage, well under the 5 percent limit
on insect damage for in-shell walnuts).<BR>
<P>
The Frances believe that soil amendments, including those added
to regulate soil acidity, are the most important considerations
in transforming a conventional operation to an organic one.  They
view cover crops as the next most important consideration.  John
says if the pest-management potential of cover cropping pans out,
cover crops could be the primary consideration.<BR>
<P>
The Frances say their transition is going successfully, and that
their soil quality and economic position are both improving. 
They also believe that the new approaches have lessened their
economic risks by better insulating them from fluctuations in
petrochemical prices.  For people considering transition, the
Frances recommend examining agricultural practices as soberly
as they would any other investment, and suggest in-field experiments
and long-range thinking.  Bottom-line benefits in production can
come quickly, but it is important to plan ahead, they say.  The
soil is a conservative system with much inertia, and full benefits
from so-called organic practices may not become apparent for five
years.

<H1>Seasonal and local diets: consumers' role in achieving a sustainable
food system.</H1>
<P>
<I>Jennifer Wilkins<BR>
<I>Research in Rural Sociology and Development 6:149-166. 1995</I></I>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note: This article offers a succinct overview of
the forces influencing the current globalized, resource-intensive
food system and the trend toward a more sustainable food economy.
It suggests that achieving a more sustainable food and agricultural
system is an appropriate goal for consumers and offers specific
educational strategies for doing so. Many of the issues and questions
discussed in this article will be considered in greater detail
from a California perspective at the SAREP fall conference, Community
Food Systems: Sustaining Farms and People in the Emerging Economy(see
article, page 10).</I>
<P>
Although current dietary guidelines for the public have generally
been based on nutrient requirements and disease prevention, Wilkins
suggests in this article that emerging concerns with ecological
sustainability are becoming increasingly relevant for influencing
dietary change. In fact, Wilkins says, goals to improve food system
sustainability are completely consistent with those that promote
individual nutritional health.
<P>
Gussow and Clancy (1986) first suggested the term, &quot;sustainable
diets&quot; to describe an eating pattern based on the Dietary
Guidelines that would contribute to personal health as well as
to the sustainability of the food and agricultural system. One
of the primary assumptions underlying a &quot;sustainable diet&quot;
is that foods are produced, processed and distributed as locally
as possible. This approach would support more regional agricultural
systems that preserve farmland and community economic viability,
require less energy for transportation and offer consumers the
freshest, ripest foods from the region. In the context of the
current, centralized food system where most foods in commercial
outlets travel thousands of miles, where export markets and the
concept of &quot;comparative advantage&quot; play a large role
in production decisions and where consumers are generally unaware
of the sources of their food, such a sustainable diet may be hard
to achieve. 
<P>
Nevertheless, a growing number of researchers and sustainable
agriculture groups are exploring alternative models for educating
consumers about more local, sustainable diets. The &quot;foodshed,&quot;
loosely analogous to a watershed, has surfaced as one conceptual
way to think about the origins and destinations of foods in a
particular region. Additionally, the regional Sustainable Agriculture
Working Groups (SAWGs) have promoted diverse, decentralized production,
coupled with value-added local marketing and consumer education
about a more sustainable, local food system in various policy
proposals.
<P>
Wilkins suggests this renewed interest in regional food systems
may be stimulated by a growing awareness of corporate control
and concentration in the food and agricultural system and its
effects on farmers' diminishing share of the food dollar. Another
factor influencing consumers' interest is that in many parts of
the United States, more than 70 percent of consumers' food supply
is imported from outside the region, making them dependent on
other areas for their food. A third factor contributing to an
interest in building a more self-reliant food system is the concern
that the current food system depends so heavily on a continuous
supply of cheap oil (for agricultural chemicals, transportation,
and food processing) and, in some farming regions, cheap water.
If environmental and transportation costs were more fully accounted
for, Wilkins suggests that areas that now claim a comparative
advantage in food production may change. Further, if demand for
fruits and vegetables increases as current nutritional recommendations
advise, regional vs. global responses to expand supply could be
very different depending on whether global accessing or local
diversification are promoted. These options pose significant differences
in terms of costs and impacts to regional agricultural production,
processing and the economic vitality of particular communities.
<H3>Benefits and Barriers of Eating from the Foodshed</H3>
<P>
According to Wilkins, one of the most important benefits of increasing
regional food self-reliance is the opportunity to educate consumers
about the &quot;carrying capacity&quot; of a particular region.
(Reviewer's note: Carrying capacity is the population that a particular
region can support sustainably.) In addition, there is the potential
for economic renewal and a strengthening of farmland preservation
policies as a result of stronger local markets for growers and
processors. Greater regional self-reliance also decreases the
current concentration in the food system and potentially improves
local food security. 
<P>
There are also potential disadvantages or barriers to increasing
regional food self-reliance. First, product variety, especially
in some parts of the country during the winter months, will be
limited and consumer acceptance may be minimal. A second and related
concern is the nutritional adequacy of a regionally-based diet.
Achieving nutritional objectives is possible in more locally-based
food systems, but will probably require significant consumer education.
Third, a more locally-based diet would diminish markets from other
areas, especially markets in less developed countries, potentially
resulting in negative consequences for their local economies.
And last, if attempts were made locally to continue providing
the same year- round diversity of fruits and vegetables we have
within our current food system, it could result in farmers using
unsustainable practices or levels of inputs that result in damage
to the environment. 
<H3>Consumer Education and Research </H3>
<P>
Since a shift to a more regional food system would require significant
dietary changes for many consumers, a willingness to consider
these changes is necessary. For example, a more local diet would
mean less fresh fruits and vegetables during certain times of
the year, and require that consumers change their cooking habits
and increase their knowledge of the availability of seasonal foods.
In addition, for most consumers, few links are made between their
food choices and the larger environmental, economic and social
consequences of the food system. Wilkins suggests that information
regarding place of origin and growing methods is important for
consumers to have and use in their food choices. More information
on labels could help in this regard. Policies that support education
about how to purchase, plan and prepare meals based on locally
available foods are needed. Regional food guides are examples
of this strategy. Other policies that support direct marketing
strategies such as community supported agriculture projects (subscription
farms) would also be useful.
<P>
Research is still needed to address questions about the costs
and benefits associated with transitioning to a more regional
food system. If demand were to increase for local foods, we need
information about how local markets and local agriculture might
change. In addition, little is known about what consumers consider
&quot;local&quot; or what should constitute a &quot;foodshed.&quot;
More needs to be learned about how consumers' choices are influenced
by how they feel about where their food is grown, and its perceived
and actual nutritional adequacy.
<P>
Wilkins concludes by suggesting that as consumers become more
aware of the increasing environmental and social costs associated
with the current global food system and the potential benefits
of a more decentralized one, food preferences may indeed shift.
However, this change in consumer demand will only come about with
effective and continuous education through a variety of venues.

Technology, Politics, and People.  </I>A conference held June
13, 1991, Sacramento, CA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Reviewer's note: The following article summarizes a presentation
given at a conference on &quot;Water in California Agriculture:
Technology, Politics, and People&quot;, June 13, 1991 in Sacramento,
California sponsored by the National Center for Appropriate Technology
and La Cooperativa Campesina de California with support from PG
&amp; E.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Much of the farmland in California's San Joaquin Valley is dependent
on water imported by the Federal Government's Central Valley Project
(CVP) and the state of California's State Water Project (SWP).
 These multi-billion dollar projects bring water through hundreds
of miles of aqueducts and canals from reservoirs in northern California
to the southern and western San Joaquin Valley.  Accompanying
the construction of this water distribution system was the development
of new political institution-water districts-to manage the water
deliveries.  These water districts are bound contractually to
the SWP and the CVP.  The nature of the relationship that has
emerged between these water districts and the large landowners
of the San Joaquin Valley is the subject of Goodall's presentation.
 Goodall argues that the large landowner has become the dominant
partner in the political system, particularly in water institutions.
 He then documents the rise of property-weighted electoral systems
and the erosion of the democratic process in the San Joaquin Valley.
 Finally, Goodall records the convergence of major organizations-public
and private, local and state-and their influence on policy and
rural communities.
<H3><B>Land Ownership</B></H3>
<P>
Using data from historical documents such as James Bryce's <I>American
Commonwealth, </I>published in 1888, to more contemporary studies
from the California Institute for Rural Studies and the U.S. Interior
Department, Goodall describes the trend toward concentration in
land ownership in the San Joaquin Valley.  For example, &quot;in
the five water districts that take two-thirds of all State Water
Project deliveries in the San Joaquin Valley, eight owners account
for 60% of the land area.&quot;  Goodall then goes on to make
the connection between ownership pattern, choice of enabling act
for water district incorporation, and policy decision making of
the districts.
<H3><B>Water Institutions and Local Control</B></H3>
<P>
Water districts are legal government entities created by acts
of the state legislature.  Goodall points out that petitioners
seeking to initiate a district are in a position to select an
act that defines the electorate in a manner likely to be supportive
of the goals sought by the petitioners.<BR>
<P>
According to Goodall, there are two distinct types of political
systems characterizing water districts in rural California.  One
tends to be democratic and the other, organized by local or absentee
propertied elites, is less so.  The water organizations that are
likely to be democratic are located in the Sacramento Valley and
the east side of the San Joaquin Valley.  They were settled in
the late 19th century and their water was dependent first on ground
water reserves and streams from the Sierra.  These districts were
authorized by the Wright Act of 1887, the state legislature's
first comprehensive enabling act for water district organization.
 Voting for directors in irrigation districts is based on one
vote for each registered voter.<BR>
<P>
Toward the end of the 19th century, this irrigation district movement
was resisted by owners of large properties.  Their response was
the California Water District Act of 1913.  In districts authorized
by this act, voting was weighted by property; one vote for each
dollar's worth of land.<BR>
<P>
The Wright Act was responsible for the incorporation of most of
the districts up to the years immediately following World War
II.  Since the war, the trend has been for water districts to
select those enabling acts (particularly the California Water
District Law) that restrict participation in district formation
to landowners, and weight voting according to the amount of property
owned.  This trend reflects the expansion of irrigable acreage
in the southern and western San Joaquin Valley due to the completion
of the SWP and the CVP.  Thus, Goodall concludes, &quot;there
is a simple, straightforward relationship between large corporate
entities and the public agency.  Concentrated landownership is
a primary source of political influence and there is a stable
bias in the distribution of public benefits.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Goodall then describes some of his research in which he classified
water districts by the type of enabling act and collected comprehensive
data on elections and financial performance.  His results showed
that one person-one vote districts exhibit far greater competitive
electoral performance and were relatively stable, financially,
compared to districts with property-weighted electoral systems.
 He also found that those who cannot participate in a district's
decision making are frequently excluded from important benefits.
<BR>
<P>
Where there is differential access to the water system and its
political system, there is also differential effects on the communities
in the district.  Goodall cites Isao Fujimoto's work in which
towns were analyzed according to their location in democratic
water districts with small farm operations or undemocratic water
districts with large operations prevailing.  Fujimoto found that
the areas characterized by small farm operations have given rise
to democratic political institutions (such as water districts)
and that the towns in these areas are rich and complex in character.
 On the other hand, areas in which large farms predominate have
given rise to communities which are relatively simple (few if
any services or institutions) and which tend to have undemocratic
water districts.  Similar findings are noted by Professor Dean
MacCannell's studies of the Westland Water District-an area of
extensive landholdings and property- weighted voting in water
districts.  Deteriorating rural communities, characterized by
negative social conditions are the norm in this area (see <I>Components
</I>2(3):9-12).<BR>
<P>
Goodall then looks at the broader picture and observes that there
are &quot;social costs as well as environmental costs to the massive
interbasin transfer of large quantities of water.&quot;  He compares
general income, poverty, employment, education, and public health
statistics between eight northeastern water origin counties and
San Joaquin Valley counties and finds a big difference. Goodall
concludes that &quot;In the San Joaquin counties, site of an abundant,
rich agriculture, by American standards a sharply divided society
has emerged.  In the northeast, there is readier access to civic
institutions and a more nearly even distribution of material reward.&quot;
<H3><B>Organizational Convergence</B></H3>
<P>
Goodall describes the two major water organizations in California:
(1) the Department of Water Resources which is responsible for
protecting, conserving, developing and managing the state's water;
and (2) the State Water Contractors Corporation which represents
twenty-eight of the thirty water districts which have contracted
for water service from the SWP.  These two organizations are dependent
on one another. The Department is financially dependent on the
Contractors Corporation since $711 million is drawn to it annually
from the SWP.  The Contractors Corporation is dependent on the
Department for the water.  The Department is a public organization,
accountable to the governor and the people of the state. The Contractors
Corporation is a private corporate entity consisting of water
districts, without elected representatives.  Yet, Goodall points
out that despite their apparent dissimilarity, they are remarkably
similar.  They share personnel with similar values, interests,
backgrounds and expertise.  There is a general unity and sense
of consensus among the people of both agencies. Thus, the distinction
between these two agencies is blurred.<BR>
<P>
Goodall summarizes three trends: (1) an increase in the concentration
in land ownership in the San Joaquin Valley; (2) the expansion
of irrigable acreage in the southern and western Valley and an
increase in water districts with property-weighted electoral systems;
and (3) the convergence of the major public and private water
organizations in the State.  Based on these findings, he concludes
that water development is fostering a new political economy in
California. The tendency to weight voting by property has created
new institutional arrangements in which water district priorities
are less likely today to be influenced by the preferences of resident
registered voters.  The distinction between political and economic
power and between public and private considerations of welfare
has been blurred.  New, private hierarchies have displaced public
organizations and elected representatives so that the participation
of ordinary citizens is now limited.  The result, according to
Goodall, is that &quot;both environmental degradation and social
inequity have come to be described as 'development.'&quot;  He
ends by suggesting that the process is not complete and that we
monitor these trends and their results on rural communities more
closely as we plan for the future.<BR>

<H3>SAREP Grants</H3>

<P>For the ninth year, UC SAREP is offering funding for research and education
grants that lead to production or policy alternatives for the agricultural
community which support environmentally and economically sound production
and food systems. This year SAREP is offering approximately $200,000 in
grant money for crop or livestock production options; environment and natural
resources; marketing, consumer education and community food systems; and
labor, land use and other community development and public policy issues.
Small grants are being offered for graduate student support ($2,000 per
individual) and educational meetings ($1,000 per meeting). The deadline
for applications is August 1, 1996. The Request for Proposals (RFP) is
available by mail or via the World Wide Web (http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu).
The RFP has been sent to everyone on SAREP's mailing list. If you have
not received an RFP, contact SAREP at (916) 752-7556 or e-mail the office
at sarep@ucdavis.edu </P>

<H3>USDA-SARE Western Region</H3>

<P>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Western Region Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education, SARE, program has set July 23, 1996 as the start
date for three of its competitive grants efforts, including: </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, SARE, grants for
sustainable agriculture research; Deadline: October 29, 1996</B>.The SARE
grants program continues to target funding to whole-farm/ranch systems
projects that increase understanding and adoption of sustainable agriculture.
Projects qualify as whole-system research by addressing weak links or information
gaps in a system, or by assessing the multiple impacts of different components
of agricultural systems. </LI>

<LI><B>Agriculture in Concert with the Environment, ACE</B> (a joint venture
of USDA and the US-EPA), grants for research on agricultural practices
that minimize environmental effects and hazards; Deadline:<B> October 29,
1996</B>. The ACE program is requesting proposals for research and education
projects that will lead to reduced environmental stress from agricultural
practices. Priority issues for ACE funding in the Western Region will likely
include irrigated agriculture; nutrient management; environmentally-sound
multiple land uses; and animal waste management. </LI>

<LI><B>Professional Development Program</B> grants to develop materials
and approaches to help <BR>
Cooperative Extension Service, Natural Resource Conservation Service and
other professionals expand their understanding of sustainable agriculture.
Deadline: November 26, 1996. The professional development program is asking
for project proposals that will improve the ability of Cooperative Extension,
NRCS and other agricultural professionals to conduct educational programs
and activities in sustainable agriculture. Project subject matter can deal
with any agricultural endeavor, and may include material on the effects
of sustainable practices on the quality of life for farmers, ranchers and
rural communities. Projects can be designed for agents working in production
agriculture, 4H/youth development or other areas. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Note: For information on any of the three grant proposals, call the
Western SARE office at Utah State University at (801) 797-3537 to add your
name/institution to the distribution list for Calls for Proposals, or to
request application materials after July 23, 1996. For other information,
contact Kristen Kelleher, communications specialist (916) 752-5987; kkelleher@ucdavis.edu.
The regional call for research proposals from area producers or producer
groups is not set for release until November 5, 1996. However, please feel
free to contact the Western SARE office to add your name to the specialized
mailing list for western farmers and ranchers. The Western Region includes
Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho,
Micronesia, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, N. Mariana Islands, Oregon, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming. </P>

<H3>Organic Research Grants</H3>

<P>The Organic Farming Research Foundation is offering funds for organic
farming research, dissemination of research results to organic farmers
and growers interested in making the transition to organic production,
and consumer education on organic farming issues. Projects should involve
farmers in design and execution, and take place on working farms when possible.
Proposals of $3,000-$5,000 are encouraged. Matching funds and/or in-kind
contributions are recommended. Proposals are considered twice a year; the
next round of proposals must be received by July 15, 1996. To receive copies
of grant application procedures and the OFRF Research and Education Priorities
describing target areas, write Grants Program, Organic Farming Research

<STRONG>A Guide to Spanish Language Sustainable Agriculture Publications</STRONG><BR>
This UC SAREP-funded publication is a collection of English abstracts of 74 Spanish-language 
documents about sustainable farming practices for farmworkers and entry level farmers. The 
abstracts cover a wide range of topics, from the principles of sustainability to practical 
information about soil and water management, agricultural machinery, field safety and learning 
English as a second language. Each abstract includes the author of the original publication, 
a summary, its availability, cost, and its level of readability. Most of the publications were 
chosen so that individuals with primary or secondary education can read them. Farm advisors and 
others who work with Spanish-speaking farmers and farmworkers will be able to use these resources 
to do outreach and educational programs about sustainable farming practices with their clientele. 
SAREP has established libraries for the original Spanish documents at five strategic sites in 
California including the farm advisors offices in San Diego and Fresno, at UC Santa Barbara, 
at the Rural Development Center in Salinas, and at the Small Farm Center at UC Davis. 90 pages.

<STRONG>How to Stabilize Your Farm Work Force (and Increase Profits, Productivity, and Personal 
Satisfaction)</STRONG><BR>
This UC SAREP-funded handbook shows farmers how to diversify their operations to keep employees 
busy throughout the year. It brings together the strategies, benefits and challenges encountered 
by farmers who keep workers employed year-round. Interviews were conducted with 35 California 
farmers who shared some of the underlying principles that make their systems work, including 
crop diversification and rotation, staggered planting, saving work for off-season, labor sharing 
with other farmers and selective mechanization. Although no easy formula for year-round cropping 
systems can be given, details and charts are included for three farms from different areas of 
California. Written by a team of UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors and independent 
agricultural economists. 44 pages. Authors: Suzanne Vaupel, Gary Johnston, Franz Kegel, Gregory 
Billikopf, and Melissa Cadet. Cost: $6.<P>

Organic vegetable farms on the Central 
Coast region of California are generally intensive operations.
 That is, two and sometimes three crops may be harvested off the
same acreage each year.  Many approaches exist for growing and
marketing organic vegetables.  This publication describes the
range of soil management practices, pest management, crop rotations,
cover crops, and harvest and packing methods currently used by
organic growers on the Central Coast of California.  Marketing
options and state and federal regulations governing organic commodities
are also discussed.  A general sequence of operations, equipment
requirements, resource use, costs, yield and return ranges are
presented for thirteen vegetable crops and two cover crops.  The
vegetables included are cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, garlic,
lettuce (leaf and romaine), onions (red and yellow), snap peas,
snow peas, bell peppers (green and red), sweet corn, and winter

<h2 align=center><a name="LETTER"></a>LETTER FROM THE DIRECTOR</h2>

<p>One of the roles of a land grant university is to provide a forum and
develop solutions for the challenges of the day. Maintaining and enhancing
our natural resource base is one of the greatest challenges we face. SAREP's
existence within the University of California is based on the desire of
the state's citizens to keep the agricultural system, which is inextricably
linked to our natural resources, sustainable. To do this, it is vitally
important to prepare people to carefully manage our resources and production
systems, anticipating the long-term as well as short-term repercussions
of decisions. 
<br>The sustainable approach takes the view that we should use natural
systems as the model to achieve our goals. It employs agricultural practices
that do not disrupt nature, and indeed, may enhance it. At the same time,
the sustainable approach should bring economic stability to both the farmer
and the community. </p>

<p>In the last decade, many farmers and researchers have found that they
can develop sustainable farming systems by working together using participatory,
collaborative approaches to solving problems. Farmers have found that both
basic and applied research can be very helpful when used in a whole farm,
systems-view context. Researchers have also found value working in a co-learning
atmosphere with growers. 
<img src="/sarep/staff/images/bill.gif" alt="Image:" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0  align=right>
<br>Concrete approaches to improving sustainability in a collaborative
environment include the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
and the Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) projects. Management
teams including SAREP, other UC researchers, non-profit organizations,
and farm groups are at the heart of these models. Both projects employ
a systems-view of agriculture, using soil management as the key to biological
integration. They demonstrate the feasibility of farming using natural
systems. </p>

<p>In addition to these special programs, SAREP has funded a diverse group
of projects in production agriculture, food systems, and economics and
public policy. We see these as examples that demonstrate the integration
and interconnectedness between the people who produce and consume our food
and fiber, and the natural resources necessary to make this production
possible. Our staff is working to encourage collaboration and stewardship
throughout the state with UC research and extension personnel, farmers
and consumers. To keep California's production systems alive and well,
we will continue to encourage practices and policies that enhance our natural
resources. We at SAREP are pleased to work with people from different backgrounds
and experiences to build cooperative management that is aware of its impact
on the future. </p>

<h2 align=center><a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>In 1986 the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 872, the Sustainable
Agriculture Act, to 
<br>address some of these complex issues. The Act requested that the University
of California establish the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Program (SAREP) to promote agricultural production and distribution methods
that adopt more resource-conserving, energy efficient systems. SAREP was
established in the fall of 1986.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>SAREP Goals 
<br></font></b>The goal of the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program is to support scientific research and education required
for the development of more economically viable, environmentally sensitive,
and socially responsible agricultural practices and policies, and to disseminate
this information to farmers, ranchers, researchers, policymakers and other
interested parties. </p>

<p>The 1986 Sustainable Agriculture Act defines SAREP's three main responsibilities:
</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Administration of Competitive Research Grants 
<br></font></b>The program has awarded over $2.6 million to approximately
161 basic and applied research projects, economic and public policy research
projects, seminars and field demonstrations, and graduate student grants.
These projects include studies of sustainable cropping systems, animal
husbandry, habitat enhancement for biological pest management, economic
analyses of farming systems, and topics in community development, marketing,
public policy and consumer education related to sustainable food systems.
</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Development and Distribution of Information 
<br></font></b>SAREP has collected, organized and distributed information
through the program's quarterly newsletter and other publications, videos,
and databases, many of which are now accessible on the Internet. The program's
World Wide Web Home Page includes links to information about SAREP-funded
projects, newsletter articles, and requests for proposals for competitive
grant programs. SAREP has also sponsored, co-sponsored, or supported many
workshops, conferences and seminars that share the results of research
and extend it to a variety of audiences throughout the state. </p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Support of Long-Term Farmland Studies 
<br></font></b>In 1990, SAREP helped fund the first 100-year, irrigated
farmland research site in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.
SAREP continues to fund research that addresses long-term issues related
to sustaining California agriculture and the natural and human resources
upon which it depends. </p>

<p>In the nine years since its inception, SAREP has been a catalyst within
California agriculture, in its communities and within the land grant university
system nationwide to find solutions to the complex problems we face. This
report summarizes SAREP's activities in FY 1993/1994 and FY 1994/1995,
beginning where <b>Progress Report 1990-1993 </b>ends. </p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Public and Technical Advisory Committees 
<br></font></b>Public and technical advisory committees advise SAREP on
its goals and make recommendations on the award of competitive grants.
The Public Advisory Committee includes individuals actively involved in
agricultural production (large, medium and small-sized conventional and
organic growers), as well as members from government, consumer and environmental
organizations. The Technical Advisory Committee is made up of faculty,
specialists and farm advisors throughout the state with knowledge and experience
in diverse areas related to sustainable agriculture. Individuals on the
public and technical advisory committees serve three-year terms with some
members rotating off each year. The diverse composition of SAREP's Public
and Technical Advisory Committees reflects the breadth of our goals. </p>

<p><img src="/sarep/pubs/progressreport/images/easel.gif" alt="Images: row of crops" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0  align=right></p>

<p>A primary function of the program is to offer grant money for research
and education projects. SAREP has awarded over $2.6 million in grant monies
for 161 projects over the last nine fiscal years (FY 1986/87 - FY 1994/95).
In FY 1993/94 and FY 1994/95, SAREP spent over $367,000 in new and continuing
competitive grants. These projects fall into two general areas: economics
and public policy and sustainable agricultural production. SAREP has also
funded one cropping systems comparison project for the last seven years.
This project will be described first, followed by new and continuing projects
funded in FY 1993/94 and FY 1994/95 and older projects that have submitted
final reports in the last two years.</p>

<p>Many of the other projects SAREP funded in previous funding cycles have
now been completed. SAREP has worked with investigators to publicize results
through the program's newsletter, university information channels, conferences,
and electronic and print media for the public. These projects are also
described in <b>SAREP's Progress Report 1986-1990</b> and <b>Progress Report

<p>The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and quantify
the environmental, agronomic and economic consequences of the transition
from conventional farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento Valley
to systems that are less dependent on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
The research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC
Cooperative Extension farm advisors play a key role in guiding the management
decisions applied to the various production systems. By broadening and
integrating the scope of investigation, researchers have been able to critically
evaluate the success of different farming practices and their effects on
the environment, as well as the special requirements for adapting alternative
practices to farms in other locations. </p>

<h2 align=center>Rotations and experimental design </h2>

<p>The project was initiated in FY 1988/1989, and is located on 28 acres
at the UC Davis Agronomy Farm. The main experiment occupies about 20 acres
and compares four cropping systems: 1) a conventional two-year rotation;
2) a conventional four-year rotation; 3) a low-input four-year rotation;
and 4) an organic four-year rotation. The four systems are arranged in
a split-plot design with four replicates of each system. All the cropping
systems include processing tomatoes, a high-value commodity grown on approximately
310,000 acres in California (1990 data). Other cash crops grown include
wheat, safflower, field corn, and beans. In addition, winter-spring cover
crops are grown in the low-input and organic systems. The specific rotations
used in the different management systems are shown in Figure 1. Each replicate
of the four systems started the rotation in 1989 with a different entry
point in the sequence of crops. </p>

<p><b>Both conventional systems </b>are managed using practices typical
for the southern Sacramento Valley. The two-year conventional system is
practiced by farmers when short-term profit must be maximized. <b>The low-input
system</b> includes a winter cover crop prior to planting tomatoes, safflower,
corn and beans. While trying to reduce dependency on non-renewable resources,
synthetic fertilizers or pesticides may be used in the low-input system
to maintain the profitability of the operation. <b>The organic system</b>
is managed according to the certification requirements of California Certified
Organic Farmers (CCOF); only approved fertilizers and pesticides are used.
&quot;Best farmer&quot; management practices are used in all systems. For
example, insect and disease management decisions for all systems are based
on periodic monitoring of pest levels, and no pesticides are applied until
economic threshold levels are exceeded. </p>

<p>A companion research area of eight acres is being used to test alternative
grain and cover crop legumes that could be used as cash crops, as winter
and summer cover crops, or in intercropping systems in California. Along
with this effort, investigators are evaluating various kinds of agricultural
equipment for use in reduced tillage operations and innovative cover crop
management. </p>

<h2 align=center>Observations and results </h2>

<p>Researchers have been collecting data on: crop growth, yield and quality;
soil biology; soil fertility; soil organic matter levels; soil water infiltration
rates; weeds, pest and beneficial insect populations, and disease levels;
and economic performance. Some of the key findings and questions for future
research are summarized below. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Crop growth and yield</b>. Soil fertility and weed management have
been identified as the most important factors limiting yields in the organic
and low-input systems. Project managers have altered production practices
to address these constraints. Organic and low-input tomatoes, for example,
are now transplanted instead of direct seeded. This practice leaves more
time for cover crop growth, gives tomatoes a head start in competing against
weeds and allows for the use of efficient mechanical cultivation techniques.
Manure fertilizers and foliar sprays have also improved yields in the organic
systems. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to obtain the high quality
transplants necessary for optimal growth and yield. In the 1994 growing
season, for example, researchers found that transplants in the organic
and low-input systems were infected with a virus. Symptoms became apparent
four to six weeks after transplanting, and yields in the organic and low-input
systems were lower than in the conventional systems. </p>

<p><b>Soil biology and fertility</b>. Nitrogen availability appears to
be an important factor determining tomato yields during the transition
to organic production. Prior to 1992, tomato plants in the organic system
were stunted and yellow early in the season, did not compete well with
weeds, and had yields lower than tomatoes grown under conventional methods.
These results were despite the fact that soil nitrate levels in the organic
tomatoes in 1990 and 1991 were actually higher than or equivalent to levels
in the conventional system. The reason for this phenomenon is probably
related to the importance of microbial activity in an organic system. Unlike
the conventional system where plants obtain nutrients from highly soluble
chemical sources, the organic and low-input systems rely on microorganisms
to make nutrients available for plant uptake. Through the first four years
of the rotation, it has been determined that the low-input and organic
systems derived 85 percent of their nitrogen from the vetch cover crop
that was incorporated into the soil and broken down by microbes. </p>

<p>To measure the importance of soil microbial activity, researchers looked
closely at changes in microbial biomass carbon over the growing season.
Microbial biomass carbon is an estimate of both the size of the total microbial
community and the mass of potential plant nutrients contained within the
cells of the microorganisms. This variable was measured in tomato plots
four times between March and September in both 1990 and 1992. Levels of
microbial biomass carbon fluctuated similarly in all systems over the growing
season. In 1990 the only significant differences among the four farming
systems occurred following the early April incorporation of the cover crop,
at which time the microbial biomass carbon was higher in the organic and
low-input systems. In 1992 microbial biomass carbon was higher in the organic
and low-input systems throughout the growing season. </p>

<p>Related studies have shown some interesting differences in nematode
populations among the four farming systems. Nematodes can be classified
by what they feed on: bacteria, fungi, plants, or other nematodes. In the
two conventional systems, the total numbers of all nematodes in the soil
(to 30 cm depth) did not change significantly between 1988 and 1992. In
contrast, during the same period, there were significant decreases in the
total number of nematodes in the low-input and organic systems. Bacterial
feeding nematodes are of particular interest because of their role in mineralizing
nitrogen. Thirteen of these species have been identified in this research
site. The proportion of all nematodes that are bacterial feeders declined
over the four years in the two conventional systems, increased in the low-input
system and declined in the organic system. The decline in the organic system
is surprising given the high levels of microbial biomass measured in those
plots. Researchers suggest that the late sampling date for nematodes may
have been responsible for this discrepancy. </p>

<p><b>Insects, Weeds and Diseases. </b>The shift from conventional to low-input
or organic pest control did not result in large increases in relative abundance
of most pest species over the period of this study. However, there were
some significant short-term problems in individual farming systems. Significantly
greater damage occurred in organic and low-input plots due to tomato fruitworm
in 1989 and stink bugs in 1992, while insecticides prevented damage to
conventional plots. Similarly, the cover crop residue appeared to increase
damage by seed corn maggot to safflower and corn in two consecutive years.
Verticillium increased in soils on the conventional two-year plots, probably
because of the increased frequency of tomato plantings in this system.
The presence of the disease organism, however, does not seem to have affected
yields in those plots. Bacterial spot of processing tomato was severe in
the spring of 1993, due to rain and a hailstorm. Aerial treatments were
not practical for the small plots in this study, but by the time the fields
had dried sufficiently for ground application, the weather was hot and
dry, stopping the epidemic. Rust occurred every year on all safflower plots.
However, it was not observed to cause yield loss. Corn smut was observed
in all plots, but the level of its incidence remained below the treatment
threshold. </p>

<p>Weeds were a problem in all systems, but the different control methods
employed in each system favored the growth of several key species. In the
low-input and organic systems, barnyardgrass has become a significant problem.
In the conventional systems, field bindweed and nightshade have been more
problematic. The shift to these weed species has resulted in modifications
to the control strategies, including herbicide changes or increased cultivation
frequency, but there has been little or no change in total weed cover.
The vagaries of the weather presented an added challenge in low-input and
organic systems. For example, the wet spring in 1993 prevented timely cultivation
and resulted in increased weed competition in the organic corn where herbicides
were not used. </p>

<p><b>Economics.</b> Results to date suggest that similar crop yields may
be obtained when &quot;best farmer&quot; management practices are used
in each of the different systems. Similar yields, however, do not necessarily
translate into similar profits. The yields and organic price premiums of
tomatoes, and year-to-year variation in production costs for each system
were the most important factors determining relative whole-farm profit
(Figure 2). During the 1991 growing season, for example, gross returns,
per acre operating costs, and net returns above total costs were all highest
in the conventional two-year rotation (all crops combined). The 1992 season,
by contrast showed that the organic systems had the highest figures in
each of these same categories. Reduced whole-farm profits per acre in the
1993 and 1994 seasons can be attributed to problems with tomato transplants
as described earlier. </p>

<p>Results of this study support what other studies have found: The transition
period (as evidenced by the performance of the low-input system) carries
significant risk. There are no price premiums for &quot;transitional commodities,&quot;
costs of production may be high, growers are generally on the steep part
of the learning curve, and the new production system can be ecologically
unstable for a time. </p>

<h2 align=center>Conclusions </h2>

<p>From the standpoint of crop performance and yield, it appears that a
rotation of processing tomatoes, safflower, field corn and wheat or winter
legume, followed by double-cropped dry beans, is a good crop rotation on
which to make systems comparisons. The use of nitrogen-fixing winter cover
crops for green manure and as seed crops has merit, but also resulted in
crop management challenges that required &quot;best farmer&quot; experience
and flexibility to work within the constraints imposed by time and weather.
The late winter, early spring management of cover crops, including residue
management, seedbed preparation, supplemental manuring and the retention
of sufficient soil moisture to germinate tomatoes, corn and safflower has
become a central research theme for continuing studies in the large companion
plots adjacent to the main experiment. The interdisciplinary group is focusing
on several key issues as the project continues its second rotation cycle.
These include identifying the best cover crops for each system/season combination
and observing phenomena that have an impact on soil fertility and plant
nutrition, particularly the season-long monitoring of cover crop nitrogen,
crop growth and yield. The long-term implications of weed control, as well
as the related demand for creative management and appropriate equipment,
are critical. </p>

<p>Conclusions about the preferable crop with which to enter the rotation
are still premature. The attractive premiums offered for organically grown
tomatoes, and regulations that specify a minimum of three years without
pesticides prior to certification, suggest that field corn would be the
best starting point of the rotation, but pest control (and especially weed
management) implications of this choice must be considered. Choices will
also depend on the grower's economic situation and a consideration of the
wide range of costs and returns for the five cash crops in the rotation.
The challenges of managing winter cover and grain legume cash crops without
herbicides (organic), or with short-lived, post-emergence herbicides (low-input),
are at least partially offset by the opportunities to plant or replant
catch crops, such as spring barley after lupine and pink beans after safflower
in this study. </p>

<h2 align=center>SUSTAINING AGRICULTURE IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY: 
<br>DEVELOPING COMMUNITY NETWORKS TO PROMOTE 
<br>COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT-RESPONSIBLE AGRICULTURE </h2>

<p><b>Budget: 
<br></b><i>FY 91/92: $7,787

<br>James&nbsp;Pepper, associate professor, Environmental Studies Board,
UC Santa Cruz</i> </p>

<p>One of the critical issues facing California agriculture is its interaction
with nearby communities. Regions are being forced to come to terms with
preserving agriculture in the face of increasing market, development and
population pressures. Realizing that addressing these issues would need
to be a community process, individuals formed a coalition in Santa Cruz
County in the fall of 1991 with funding from SAREP. The goal of this Agriculture
and Community Project (AgComm) coalition was to examine the status of agriculture
in Santa Cruz County and collaborate with the local community to ensure
its long-term viability. Principal investigators Steve Gliessman and Jim
Pepper organized and directed the initial planning committee which was
composed of representatives of a broad base of community interests. After
meeting for a year (May 1992-May 1993), the planning committee defined
topics which provided the foundation for specific areas of research and
became the basis of the agenda for a communitywide forum held November
20, 1993 in Aptos. At this forum, participants examined ways in which the
entire community is connected to agriculture and explored strategies to
broaden and strengthen this connection. Local residents were particularly
interested in community education, encouraging the community to buy locally
grown foods and find common ground between urban and agricultural interests.
</p>

<p>Concurrently, the planning committee's work led to directed research
by the AgComm staff about land use, farmland preservation and farmworker
housing. Exploration of policy options by the AgComm staff included research
on agriculture elements that have been drafted or approved under General
Plan law in 11 counties in California. As a result of their work on land
preservation, the Agricultural Policy Advisory Commission to the local
Board of Supervisors asked the AgComm group to advise them on issues such
as agriculture at the urban edge. Should the Board of Supervisors and the
County Planning Department decide to pursue an agricultural element, work
on the General Plan elements will be compiled along with recommendations
for proceeding. </p>

<p>In the fall of 1994, the continuing interest in land preservation policies
led the AgComm group to conduct a &quot;mobile workshop&quot; or bus tour
for local agriculture leaders, planning officials and policymakers on &quot;Preserving
Agricultural Land on the Edge: Ag Land Preservation Techniques.&quot; A
workbook with articles describing the tools and techniques for preserving
agricultural land was produced for this mobile workshop and is available
for purchase from the AgComm Project. For more information, contact: Kerstin

<p>This project surveyed retail produce buyers in order to: 1) gather demographic
data on the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in Alameda County
food markets; 2) determine produce buyer criteria for selecting fresh produce;
3) assess buyers' attitudes toward sustainably produced food; and 4) identify
characteristics of consumers who shop where fresh fruits and vegetables
are available. The study found that only 27 percent of the 819 markets
in Alameda County eligible to accept food stamps handle any significant
amount of fruits and vegetables. When selecting produce, buyers listed
quality and appearance first with variety, price, and consumer needs ranking
lower. Wholesale terminals or distributor/brokers were about evenly used.
Buyers had very little knowledge of sustainable agriculture and only one

<p>The Rural Development Center (RDC) is a community-based agricultural
training and resource center which offers educational programs and practical
experience opportunities to farmers and low-income people in the Salinas
Valley. In this project, the RDC conducted a follow-up study of former
students to assess the impact of the program on them and the extent to
which program goals were met. Interviews with former students sought information
about the motivations, difficulties and barriers to becoming a small-scale
farmer in the Salinas Valley; the implications of adopting and using sustainable
practices; and the skills, knowledge, and personal characteristics that
contribute to the development of successful and sustainable farms by former
farmworkers. The study found that participants in RDC programs have gained:
1) practical farming and business skills and experience; 2) confidence
in their abilities to realize objectives and achieve goals; 3) exposure
to sustainable agricultural methods which they had not seen or heard about
in California agriculture as they had previously experienced it; and 4)
a network of support for farmer-to-farmer information exchange and assistance,
family integration and involvement of children. The study found that networks
of community support and interaction are key factors in the success of
Spanish-speaking beginning farmers. For more information, contact: Jos

<h2 align=center>EXAMINATION OF THE INTERACTION OF AGRICULTURAL

<br></b><i>Don&nbsp;Villarejo, executive director, California Institute

<p>This study examines the interaction of agricultural variables and rural
community conditions in 75 communities in the Central Valley of California.
The following hypotheses will be tested: </p>

<ul>
<li>Larger farms are associated with lower quality of community life; </li>

<li>Separation of farm management from ownership is associated with lower
quality of community life; </li>

<li>Crop diversity is associated with higher quality of community life;
and</li>

<li>The rate of pesticide permit applications is negatively associated
with quality of 
<br>community life. </li>
</ul>

<p>Although these hypotheses are framed within the same general theoretical
perspective as previous macrosocial accounting projects, this project uses
current and much better data provided by the California Institute for Rural
Studies (CIRS). These data were originally coded by CIRS from mandated
pesticide application permit forms and include information about the crop(s),
field sizes, address of applicant, location of the fields, etc. The availability
of this data and the quality of measurements will allow a much better focus
on agricultural issues than was previously possible. On the social variables,
the project will continue to improve measures of community quality especially
in the area of ethnic relations (availability of quality schooling for
minority children, income differentials between white and non-white holders
of the same occupational positions, etc.). In addition, the project will
continue to run the full battery of standard tests of community life quality:
family income levels, employment rates, and poverty indices. These two
data sets will then be merged to find out which agricultural variables
significantly affect the social variables in these 75 communities. An analysis
of variance and several correlation matrices have been completed preparatory
to the regression analysis. The results of these preliminary tests suggest
that improvements in the quality of the data bases will have a noticeable
impact on the results and that strong regression models can be built of
the relationship between agricultural structure and community conditions.

incorporate ethics into their decisions and practices. The curriculum uses
written case studies that include a narrative description of the case,
as well as questions and discussion topics that provoke participants to
measure the case against their ethical criteria or their notions of socially
shared values. The cases include Saltwater Intrusion in the Central Valley;
Selling Small Fruit Illegally; Levi Strauss: Selling Jeans, Promoting Ethics;
General Mills Cereal Contamination and others. These materials have been
tested on a variety of audiences: workshops at farm conferences, farm advisor
and specialist workgroup meetings, and university classes. The tests indicate
that the material as well as the pedagogical approach are very successful
in stimulating thought and dialogue about ethics as it relates to the food

<p>This project has provided a forum for the development of new and creative
pesticide reduction policy options tailored to California's specific situation.
During Year 1, the Pesticide Action Network of North America (PANNA) consulted
with 46 leaders in California agriculture to discuss pesticide use reduction
policy options. These discussions led to a draft pesticide use reduction
plan for California. The plan, to be used in ongoing policy discussions,
calls on policy makers to: 1) establish a numerical use reduction goal
that is voluntary and ambitious, at least 50 percent reduction of use in
the state by the year 2000 measured against a base year of 1992; 2) establish
specific reduction strategies by sector by consulting with all affected
parties and communities; 3) phase out high-hazard pesticides according
to specific criteria based on impacts to human health and the environment;
4) increase funding for alternative agriculture research through competitive
grant programs; 5) develop a program of financial incentives for growers
in transition to alternative agricultural practices; and 6) develop a pesticide
fee-based mechanism for funding both research and extension alternatives
and financial incentive programs. </p>

<p>During Year 2 the researchers produced a report Financial Incentives
and Their Potential to Reduce Pesticide Use in Three California Crops:
Cotton, Oranges, and Strawberries. The report was based upon direct interviews
with farmers, pest control advisors and Cooperative Extension personnel,
supplemented by meetings and other communication with participants in PANNA's
pesticide use reduction work. The study identifies a variety of financial
incentive options, and analyzes their potential utility in ongoing policy
discussions. The financial incentives considered include: cost-share, tax
credits, modified price support programs, crop insurance, technical assistance,
specially licensed pest control advisors, increased regulation of high
hazard pesticides and pesticide use, and agricultural land preservation.

<p>The Arcata Farm and Education Project demonstrates how a small project
can spark creative connections that promote a more sustainable community
food system. The two-acre, student-run community farm is the result of
cooperation between Humboldt State University, Cooperative Extension, the
City of Arcata, and local farmers and educators. The project has five major
objectives: to use the farm as an educational facility to teach university
students about sustainable small farm management skills; to operate the
farm using community supported agriculture (CSA) principles and to assess
the feasibility of the CSA in the region; to develop and incorporate curriculum
for local elementary and high schools; to facilitate communication about
agriculture in the community by involving local farmers, refugee farmers
and community members in classes and activities at the farm; and to give
community youth groups access to the facility as a place to experiment
with animal husbandry and sustainable agriculture projects. A manual, a
slide set, and possibly a video are being developed that will describe
the farm's activities, how it has overcome problems, and lessons for other
communities. For more information, contact: Peter Lehman, Humboldt State

<p>With support from the Kellogg-funded California Alliance for Sustainable
Agriculture, California formed a Sustainable Agriculture Working Group
(SAWG) in 1993, which held its initial meeting on October 8-9, 1994 to
gather a broad cross-section of individuals and groups with interests related
to sustainable agriculture for the purpose of: 1) identifying key SAWG
objectives and purposes; 2) identifying opportunities for collaboration
and cooperation among the groups; 3) educating one another about needed
policies to support sustainable agriculture in the state; and 4) learning
about local, state and national policy processes. This meeting was the
first statewide public forum for information exchange and strategic thinking
around state and national sustainable agriculture policy issues. As a result
of the meeting, a Community Food Security Committee was formed. The committee
began meeting in the fall of 1994 and has organized a project which is

<p>Most apples are treated with the antioxidant diphenylamine (DPA) before
cold storage to prevent the development of storage scald. This project
examined the effects of hot water dips before cold storage on Granny Smith
apples in an effort to find an alternative means of scald control. The
hot water treatments were compared to controlled atmosphere, DPA, and hot
air treatments. </p>

<p>In this project, the apples were immersed for varying lengths of time
in 46, 48, 50, and 52 C water before storage at 0.5 C for three and
six months. While scald development and severity were reduced, no treatment
provided 100 percent control. Higher temperatures or longer immersion times
were more effective at reducing scald. Most heat treatments resulted in
increased firmness of apples after storage, particularly after six months,
compared with non-heated apples. Controlled atmosphere and DPA treatments
gave the best scald control, followed by the hot air treatment of 38 C
for four days. The best hot water treatments were 50 C for five minutes
and 48 C for 15 minutes. It does not appear that hot water dips will be
a commercially feasible treatment for the apple industry because of the
lack of adequate scald control and the risk of fruit injury. </p>

<p>Hot water dips were also tested on pomegranates and kiwifruit. Treatments
of pomegranates with hot water were not successful in preventing chilling
injury or controlling decay. Kiwifruit decay control experiments were also
unsuccessful primarily due to lack of Botrytis rot development in inoculated
fruit. For more information, contact: Elizabeth Mitcham, Department of

<h2 align=center>RELEASE OF NITROGEN FROM A LEGUMINOUS COVER CROP

Crops, UC Davis</i> </p>

<p>Leguminous cover crops begin to release nitrogen to the soil once they
are incorporated into the soil if adequate water is available for microbial
decomposition of the plant tissue. The amount of nitrogen that is released
from a productive cover crop can be substantial, however the rate of release
of nitrogen and the duration of the release is not well understood. In
this study, researchers investigated the rate of release of nitrogen from
Lana vetch and its subsequent utilization by bell peppersa long-season,
high-nitrogen demanding vegetable. They also treated some plots with superimposed
applications of a slow-release fertilizer (feather meal) to determine if
the additional nitrogen, supplemental to the cover crop, provided season-long
nitrogen to the crop. </p>

<p>In 1992, there was a steady increase in the nitrate-nitrogen levels
of the soil solution up to 74 days following incorporation of vetch residue
into moist soil. This release of nitrogen from the vetch followed an earlier
trend observed in 1991 in a sweet corn field. The release curve of nitrogen
by vetch fit the growth pattern nicely for some vegetables such as sweet
corn and melons. These crops have their peak demand for nitrogen at the
time when the cover crop is releasing a maximum amount of nitrogen. </p>

<p>For bell pepper, the 1992 data indicates that the nitrogen supplied
by the cover crop alone did not keep the petiole nitrate-N levels as high
as plots that were amended with slow release fertilizer, which supplied
late season nitrogen to the pepper crop. However, there was no significant
improvement in yield from any of the fertilizer treatments, possibly because
of a late-season disease outbreak. In 1993 the petiole nitrate-N levels
again increased later in the growing season in the fertilized plots and
the yield in the plot fertilized with 160 pounds of nitrogen as feather
meal had a significantly higher yield. </p>

<p>These results indicate that the nitrogen released from a leguminous
cover crop such as vetch can provide significant amounts of nitrogen for
subsequent vegetable crop production. However, long-season, high-nitrogen
demanding crops such as bell peppers may need supplemental applications
of late season fertilizer for optimal growth. For more information, contact:

<p>In this project, researchers evaluated dryland legumes and native perennial
grasses for use in pasture, range, vineyard, and other farming systems
in northern California. The plants were evaluated for adaptability, persistence,
weed suppression, and management requirements. Specific components of this
project included: field trials with dryland legumes; establishment and
maintenance of a demonstration nursery; curating a large collection of
cultivars, experimental lines, and wildland species (California natives);
increasing seed of material for future trials; and providing seed to researchers,
farm advisors, and producers. </p>

<p>The researchers planted 71 accessions of annual medics (Medicago spp.)
comprising 15 species. Many of these accessions performed poorly. In general,
performance of many of the medics was excellent in the first year and poor
the second year for a number of reasons. Overall, bur medic (Medicago polymorpha)
appears to be the most promising annual medic for California. Some of the
48 accessions of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) performed
quite well. As a group, the short season accessions of subterranean clover
produced less cover than mid- or long-season lines, but they may be among
the most persistent because they finish their life cycle before soil moisture
is depleted. Another important factor relating to long-term persistence
is hard-seededness, a characteristic that most subclovers do not have.
</p>

<p>Some of the practical implications from this research are: 1) seeding
recommendations should rarely if ever be made that are based on short-term
data; 2) long-term performance of dryland legumes is very site-specific;
for this reason, large-scale seedings should be preceded by variety trials,
or at least variety trials should be included along with the plantings;
3) the seed mixes that are assembled by most companies and sold as dryland
mixes will usually contain a large percentage of seed that is of little
long-term value on the site where it is planted; and 4) many of the cultivars
developed in Australia that apparently perform well there may not show
an equivalent response here. For more information, contact Craig Thomsen,

<p>There is a growing trend in the California almond industry toward noncultivation
and cover cropping. The majority of cover crops used are resident weed
species, but almond growers need to know if certain planted cover crops
may have advantages over resident vegetation. In this project, ten cover
crop mixes were planted in an almond orchard in November 1992. In addition,
almond orchards of five innovative growers were monitored in a previously
funded SAREP project. The project compared the effects of cover crops on
soil and tree nutrition, insect populations, mowing frequency, and orchard
floor preparation at harvest. </p>

<p>Leaf nitrogen levels in all plots and on all orchard comparisons remained
adequate during the experiments. In the cover crop treatments, ladybird
beetles were highest in the Beneficial Blend, Insectary mix, vetch and
clovers; they were low in the resident vegetation, Blando brome, Zorro
fescue, and bur medic. In the orchard comparisons, ladybird beetles were
high in the established vetch/clover mixes and in the tall resident vegetation.
The numbers of parasitic wasps were highly variable, but there was a trend
toward higher numbers in the planted cover crops and fewer in the resident
vegetation. Plant feeding and beneficial mites varied among the comparison
orchards. However, in measurements taken over seven years, two-spotted
spider mites have very seldom been an economic problem in heavily cover-cropped,
unsprayed almond orchards. Almond rejects caused by peach twig borer and
navel orangeworm were usually quite low in the comparison orchards. </p>

<p>The extension of the results of this research were as impressive as
the actual results. In addition to the six field tours held from 1993 to
1995, dozens of almond growers in Merced and Stanislaus counties benefited
directly from this research in the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS) project. BIOS was coordinated by the Community Alliance with Family
Farmers (CAFF) Foundation, with extensive input from SAREP. The project
was also featured in the January/February 1995 issue of UC's California
Agriculture magazine. For more information, contact: Lonnie Hendricks,

<p>Lettuce drop is a widespread soilborne disease of lettuce in the Salinas
Valley and other coastal lettuce growing regions. The disease causes substantial
economic loss when sclerotia, the resting structures of the pathogen, build
up in the soil. Resistant cultivars are not available, and growers rely
on synthetic fungicides for managing the disease. Cover crops may influence
sclerotial levels by either acting as host plants or as organic substrates;
in both cases, sclerotia may increase in the soil. Conversely, cover crops
may increase soil microbial diversity and actually help reduce disease
incidence or severity. This study, now in its third year, is evaluating
selected cover crops to see whether lettuce drop is increased or decreased.
</p>

<p>Two years of the study indicate that Phacelia, two species of vetch,
and Austrian pea became significantly infected by this pathogen. Cover
crops were incorporated in March, allowed to decompose for a period of
time, and followed with a lettuce crop (planted early June). In early August,
the investigators began to evaluate the lettuce crop for disease. At this
time, Phacelia and purple vetch plots had significantly more disease than
the fallow control. The data collected during the first and second years
of this study indicate that some of these cover crops can support the pathogen,
resulting in increased lettuce drop. It should be noted that this is a
small plot study that used high inoculum density to induce disease. </p>

<p>In the third year of the study, sudangrass is being investigated for
suppressing lettuce drop. Broccoli residues and manure/yard waste compost
will also be evaluated for disease suppression. For more information, contact:

<p>Increasing soil organic matter favors growth of desirable bacteria and
fungi, but little is known about the mechanisms by which living plants,
crop residues, and green manures promote growth of soil microbes. This
project is identifying and quantifying small organic molecules that move
from plant material to soil microorganisms. The goal is to discover natural
products that trigger growth of beneficial, as opposed to detrimental,
soil bacteria and fungi. Measurements developed on this project eventually
may complement other commonly used parameters of soil quality. </p>

<p>During the first two years of this project, the researchers developed
extraction and analytical protocols for isolating signature compounds from
soil, and identified one signature compound, the isoflavonoid medicarpin,
in many soil samples. The most striking advance from the third year was
the identification of nucleosides as major soil compounds that are affected
by agronomic management. Elevated amounts of these molecules were found
in manured (vs. unfertilized) treatments in long-term wheat plots at Rothamsted,
England, and in organic (vs. conventional) management treatments in tomato
plots from the USDA-SARE experiment at Davis. Soil extracts prepared from
the USDA-SARE plots containing tomato, bean, and an oat-vetch mixture suggested
that sampling date, rather than crop species, had a greater effect on the
amount of small organic molecules and indicated a new group of potential
signal compounds that deserves future attention in this study. For more

<p>The variegated leafhopper is the most important insect pest in Central
Valley vineyards. This insect causes chlorotic spotting and defoliation
if damage is severe; also, its excretions attract sooty molds, which reduce
photosynthesis and cause table grape bunches to be culled. This project,
now in its third and final year, involves large replicated experiments
which were established in commercial table and raisin grape vineyards.
The researchers are testing the hypothesis that ground covers influence
leafhopper population levels, and, if so, that this is because of higher
predation. They also sought to better determine the role of three groupings
of predators (spiders, predatory flies, and predaceous mites) that are
common in vineyards but have been little studied. Temperatures and humidity
are also being monitored in cover and no-cover treatments to assess the
influence of microclimate on predators. </p>

<p>Although much of the data have not been analyzed, some preliminary observations
can be made. Trends of lower leafhopper numbers in cover-cropped plots
in the table grape vineyard are evident; however, the data do not indicate
any increase in the numbers of beneficial arthropods monitored. There is
little evidence so far that ground covers have more than a minor effect
on vine canopy temperature. For more information, contact: Kent Daane,

<p>This survey was designed to collect information from annual crop growers
that would help focus future research and extension efforts regarding the
use of cover crops in field and vegetable crop systems. UC SAREP funding
was added to this USDA-SARE program funded project, to further target growers
<i>not</i> using cover crops in order to examine barriers. Survey participants
included a random sample of 200 tomato and safflower growers in five counties
(Yolo, Solano, Sutter, San Joaquin and Colusa) plus a targeted list of
48 producers in the same five counties who were thought to be using cover
crops. Participants were asked about their usage of cover crops and their
perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of cover crops. The drawbacks
to cover crops mentioned by cover crop users and non-users were similar:
1) the cover crop could not be incorporated in time for spring planting;
2) a cash crop with a direct economic benefit could be planted instead;
and 3) the overall cost of growing the cover crop was too high (including
seed, labor, equipment, fuel and water costs). Farmers also mentioned increases
in harmful insect populations, and tillage complications due to cover crop
residue. The perceived benefits most often mentioned by farmers not currently
growing cover crops were increases in soil organic matter and the addition
of nitrogen to the soil, benefits that can be obtained through means other
than cover cropping. Many other potential benefits of cover cropping, mentioned
by the cover crop growers, were apparently unknown or unappreciated by
those who did not grow cover crops. These benefits include: increased beneficial
insects, reduced weed problems, increased water holding capacity, increased
nutrient availability to the following crop, and reduced soil compaction.
The greatest research and education needs were identified as: 1) new or
existing cover crop varieties with particular characteristics (e.g. fit
rotation, soil or weather; produce high biomass, fast growth, extensive
root system, or high N content); and 2) the effects of cover crops on various
aspects of the farming system, such as soil structure, fertility, insects
and weeds. For more information, contact: Mark Van Horn, Student Experimental

<p>There is increasing interest in improving the efficiency of nitrogen
use in vegetable crop production in order to decrease contamination of
ground water with nitrate. To this end, there has been a great deal of
research and interest in the use of &quot;quick tests&quot; for nitrate
for plant and soil analysis. In conventional farming systems, monitoring
nitrate using quick tests has proven to be a reliable measure of the crop
nitrogen status and the need for nitrogen fertilizer applications. In organic
farming systems, however, preliminary evidence indicates that nitrate may
not be a good indicator of crop nitrogen status and that the new quick
test technology may not be as applicable. </p>

<p>This study proposes to monitor nitrogen in four farms that are producing
onions: two organic farms that are using compost, cover crops and feather
meal (a slow release fertilizer), and two conventional farms. Soil nitrate
and ammonium will be monitored, as well as nitrate levels in the fresh
sap of root tissue and the total nitrogen in the onion tops. The data will
confirm if quick tests for nitrate are useful on organic farms and will
provide further information on the nitrate levels in soils of organic farms.
Both of these issues may have broad and important implications for nitrogen
leaching and groundwater contamination. For more information, contact:

<p>Many vegetable crop growers in the Salinas Valley are converting to
subsurface drip irrigation because of the benefits that it offers. These
benefits include greater water use efficiency, incremental and steady application
of nitrogen and water, and reduced drainage and nitrate leaching. In addition,
previous research by this investigator has shown that subsurface drip irrigation
reduces corky root and lettuce drop, two serious soilborne diseases. This
project will further confirm the effects of subsurface drip and furrow
irrigations on diseases of lettuce, and will include a grower field day.
Implementation of this irrigation technology would improve the sustainability
of vegetable production systems in the Salinas Valley and contribute to
reduced use of fungicides. For more information, contact: Krishna Subbarao,

<br>University of California to educate farmers, students, extension professionals
and others about sustainable farming and ranching practices, community
economic development, food systems, and other topics related to sustainable
agriculture. SAREP staff have put a high priority on working collaboratively
with colleagues in the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources
as well as farmers and community organizations to address issues of concern
to California's agriculture. These outreach efforts complement and extend
the research projects SAREP is supporting. </p>

<h3>How to Stabilize Your Farm Work Force (and Increase Profits, Productivity,
and Personal Satisfaction) 
<br>Publication SA-004, 1995 </h3>

<p>This UC SAREP-funded handbook shows farmers how to diversify their operations
to keep employees busy throughout the year. It brings together the strategies,
benefits and challenges encountered by farmers who keep workers employed
year-round. Interviews were conducted with 35 California farmers who shared
some of the underlying principles that make their systems work, including
crop diversification and rotation, staggered planting, saving work for
off-season, labor sharing with other farmers and selective mechanization.
Although no easy formula for year-round cropping systems can be given,
details and charts are included for three farms from different areas of
California. Written by a team of UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors
and independent agricultural economists. 44 pages. Authors: Suzanne Vaupel,
Gary Johnston, Franz Kegel, Gregory Billikopf, and Melissa Cadet. Cost:

<p>In early 1995 SAREP launched a World Wide Web server on the Internet
(URL=<a href="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/</a>)
which allows users to view program information from locations all over
the world. Currently the SAREP Web pages include program publications,
summaries of grants previously funded, requests for proposals for the SAREP
and Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) grants programs, a calendar
of events, and computer applications. Information is provided on topics
such as cover crops as a production option for soil improvement, attracting
barn owls as a possible component in rodent population controls, and a
comparison of bovine growth hormone with rotational grazing. Consumer and
policy issues are addressed as well, covering topics such as direct marketing,
community supported agriculture, and agricultural land preservation. When
complete, the SAREP Web pages will comprise an outstanding database of
scientific, technical and practical information, including over 300 newsletter
articles from seven years of SAREP's quarterly newsletters, and more than
100 summaries of research and education projects funded by SAREP. </p>

<p>In addition to its own information, SAREP's Web pages provide a home
for, and links to, other bodies of closely related information. For example,
our Web server includes pages from the California Energy Commission's Agricultural
Energy Assistance Program (AEAP), whose publications on energy management,
pest management, and irrigation management are searchable along with SAREP's
own, providing the public with &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for information
from the two programs. SAREP's Web page also links to other Internet sites
that feature sustainable agriculture information, such as the National
Agricultural Library's Alternative Farming Systems Information Center,
the Western Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)
program, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN), and sites that maintain
comprehesive indexes of agricultural information such as the University
of Florida's AgriGator. In addition, many of SAREP's staff are active participants
in SAN's electronic mail group, SANET-MG, and other Internet discussion
groups. </p>

<h2 align=center>Other Staff Activities </h2>

<h3>BIOS </h3>

<p>Three years ago, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Pew Charitable
Trust, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cooperatively provided
funding for the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF) Foundation
to undertake a project called the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS). This project enables almond growers in Merced and Stanislaus counties
to learn about biologically based farming while reducing reliance on synthetic
pesticides and fertilizers. The almond BIOS program involves a group of
30 to 50 participating farmers and a team of educators, including mentor
farmers experienced in biologically integrated methods, private agricultural
consultants, and University of California scientists and farm advisors.
All participating farmers are provided with a package of technical and
financial assistance. The BIOS approach thus represents an intensification
of traditional extension techniques. The almond BIOS project emphasizes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Biological and cultural control of pests; </li>

<li>On-farm habitats for beneficial insects, mites, and spiders; </li>

<li>A strong emphasis on soil-building practices, often including biological
nitrogen fixation to supply all or part of the nitrogen needed by crop
plants; and </li>

<li>Reduced reliance on agricultural chemicals. </li>
</ul>

<p>SAREP's <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> and Chuck Ingels serve as management team members
on Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) projects. In BIOS, growers
and their pest control advisors work closely with the management team to
implement practices which reduce their use of pesticides and/or synthetic
fertilizers. The almond BIOS project is currently underway in Merced and
Stanislaus counties (20 to 30 growers each), while a walnut BIOS project
is operating in Yolo and Solano counties (18 growers). Bugg is on the management
team of both the almond BIOS project and the walnut BIOS project; Ingels
is on the management team of the walnut BIOS project. Early returns from
BIOS have been impressive, with high rates of farmer participation and
adoption of the biologically integrated approach. The BIOS projects provide
the model upon which the new Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS)
initiative is based (See BIFS section for more information, p. 56). </p>

<h3>ATTRACTING BARN OWLS TO FARMS </h3>

<p>SAREP's Chuck Ingels has gathered and developed information on attracting
barn owls to farms. The barn owl is often called the most beneficial bird
in the world because its diet consists primarily of voles, gophers, mice,
and rats. Each adult barn owl may consume about one or two rodents per
night; some studies show that a nesting pair and their offspring may eat
more than 1,000 rodents per year. Although no research has yet been conducted
in California to show an effect on rodent abundance by installing nest
boxes on farms, some growers report substantial reductions in gophers.
In order to increase our understanding of barn owls, Ingels will be working
with other UC researchers on two projects: 1) an experiment to evaluate
the effects of installing nest boxes on gopher abundance; and 2) a survey
of farmers who have built nest boxes. The goal of the survey is to gather
information on the structures farmers have built, trends in nest box occupancy
by barn owls, and the perceived effects of installing nest boxes on rodent
pest problems. </p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE </h3>

<p>SAREP's <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> is serving on the steering committee of the California
Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (CASA). CASA is a coalition of university
programs and non-profit community organizations funded by a three-year,
$2 million dollar grant from the Kellogg Foundation. It is the largest
of the 18 Integrated Farming Systems projects Kellogg has funded across
the United States. Joining SAREP in the collaboration are the Bio-Integral
Resource Center, the California Adolescent Nutrition and Fitness Program,
the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems of UC Santa Cruz,
the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, the Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape
Commission, the Rural Development Center, and the Sustainable Cotton Project.
CASA's collaborative projects include a database on agricultural sustainability,
a series of workshops on sustainable alternatives to methyl bromide, a
media outreach effort to educate the public about sustainable agriculture,
outreach to farmworkers in the Salinas Valley, and start-up support for
the California Sustainable Agriculture Working Group. Other CASA activities
include creating guides for reducing farm chemical use, introducing IPM
practices to winegrape and tomato growers, a leadership training program,
and a community planning process in Santa Cruz County for sustaining agriculture
in the face of environmental threats and urban development. </p>

<p>Campbell's work for the coalition is focused on developing a working
paper to identify concrete strategies for implementing sustainable agriculture
in ways that enhance local and regional economic and social development.
During Year One of the Kellogg grant, a background paper presenting a rationale
for sustainable agriculture as an economic development strategy was prepared.
During Year Two, consultations with community food systems groups and presentations
at sustainable agriculture meetings were made to disseminate these ideas,
and case study material from a variety of California locations was collected.
Recent developments, including local marketing campaigns in Sonoma, Placer,
and Humboldt counties, indicate a renewed interest in fostering positive
links between agriculture and communities and present a ripe opportunity
for comparative analysis and information sharing. During Year Three of
the grant, the earlier working paper was revised through the development
of in-depth case studies. This revised paper was presented at the October
1995 &quot;Politics of Sustainable Agriculture&quot; conference in Eugene,
Oregon. Campbell will continue to work directly with grass roots community
groups in California to develop and evaluate community food systems projects
which enhance local economic development. Already, working relationships
have been established with representatives of Sonoma Select, Humboldt Harvest,
and PlacerGROWN. </p>

<p>Campbell also produced a fact sheet highlighting key trends and contradictions
in California agriculture. The fact sheet addresses a diverse range of
issues, including agricultural productivity, pesticide use, farm concentration,
hunger and poverty, labor wages and conditions, farmland conversion, water
issues, organic production, and farmers' markets. The fact sheet was distributed
at the February 1995 networking meeting of the Kellogg IFS initiative to
a national audience of leaders in sustainable agriculture. </p>

<h3>DEVELOPING COMMUNITY FOOD SYSTEMS </h3>

<p>SAREP analysts <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> are engaged in research
and outreach activities designed to promote development of community food
systems. These systems integrate ecologically sound distribution and consumption
patterns with sustainable production to enhance the economic and social
life of particular regions. Among the activities to date are: creation
of a new section in SAREP's Request for Proposals on community food systems,
development of an extensive bibliography, preparation of a flyer on &quot;Ten
Things You Can Do To Develop a Community Food System,&quot; developing
links between farmers and agencies that use the Alameda County Community
Food Bank, and consultation with county advisors and community groups interested
in starting local food system projects in their cities, counties, or regions.
Feenstra has written a review of local food systems in the United States
with a critical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses, and identified
strategies that might be most effective in developing additional community
food systems. This paper was presented at the October 1995 &quot;Politics
of Sustainable Agriculture&quot; conference in Eugene, Oregon. </p>

<h3>LINKING LOCAL FARMERS WITH SCHOOL FOOD SERVICES </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> has been collaborating with the UC Small Farm Center,
the California Alliance with Family Farmers, the California Federation
of Certified Farmers' Markets and the California Association of School
Business Officials to facilitate partnerships between local farmers and
school food service buyers. A presentation (and pamphlet) titled &quot;How
to Buy from Local Farmers&quot; was given at the statewide meeting of school
food service directors in April 1995. A research project that would conduct
case studies of participating and nonparticipating school districts and
several pilot projects is now being developed. Information from the case
studies and experiences from the pilot projects will be the basis of a
guide for school food service buyers and farmers about how such partnerships
might successfully be formed. It will also include local contacts by crop
and region. The guide will be disseminated widely through Cooperative Extension
and the California Department of Education. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS CONCEPTS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CLASS </h3>

<p>For several years, <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> have created assignments
and course curricula related to agricultural sustainability, regional food
systems, and community economic development for government classes at UC
Davis. Students in the classes have done field research projects to identify
the possibilities of substituting locally grown foods for imported foods
into the greater Davis community food system, and the university campus
food service. </p>

<h3>COVER CROPS WORKGROUP </h3>

<p>Chuck Ingels organized and now chairs the UC Cover Crops Workgroup.
The workgroup has nearly 100 members, mostly UC personnel. The purpose
of the workgroup is to provide a forum for Cooperative Extension farm advisors
and specialists, UC faculty, and others to share information, determine
the highest priority research and extension needs, and to coordinate activities
to fulfill these needs. Two meetings have been held, at which researchers
presented results of cover crop-related experiments. Abstracts of these
projects are available from Ingels either by mail ($5.00, checks payable
to UC Regents) or e-mail (free; caingels@ucdavis.edu). </p>

<h3>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC ISSUES WORKGROUP </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> is participating in DANR's Community Development and
Public Issues (CDPI) Workgroup. The workgroup was recently formed from
the merger of the Community Development and Public Policy workgroups. Its
members are working to promote DANR's effective involvement in policy issues
and in partnerships with California communities. At a May 1995 CDPI-sponsored
workshop Campbell presented a matrix for comparative analysis of &quot;community
interventions&quot; by DANR personnel. The matrix and analysis will be
available in a forthcoming proceedings of the conference to be published
by DANR. He is also on the planning committee for a CDPI workshop which
will train county advisors in effective methods for becoming involved in
public issues.</p>

<h3>WESTERN REGION SARE </h3>

<p>UC SAREP carries out several activities with support from its national
counterpart, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education (SARE) program, which is managed for the western
states by the Western Region SARE program located at Utah State University.
In June of 1994, UC SAREP Associate Director <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A> was selected
via a competitive process to coordinate the Western SARE Consortium/Network
for implementation of the Professional Development/In-Service Education
program for Cooperative Extension, Natural Resource Conservation Service,
and other agricultural professionals. The program is a coordinated effort
of competitive grants and state-level strategic planning and implementation
grants in the 13 western states and four Pacific Island affiliates in the
region. </p>

<p>UC SAREP also houses the Western SARE Communications Specialist, Kristen
Kelleher, who provides public information and outreach for the entire Western
SARE program of research and education grants, Agriculture in Concert with
the Environment grants (a partnership between USDA and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency), and the SARE Farmer/Rancher Research Grants. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE NETWORK </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A> continues to serve on the Executive Committee of the
national Sustainable Agriculture Network, a USDA SARE-funded effort of
information exchange which she helped to develop as chair of the SAN Committee
from its inception through 1993. SAN provides information in printed publications
and electronic databases (on diskette and on the Internet) and sponsors
an Internet electronic mail discussion group, SANET-MG, with more than
700 participants. </p>

<h3>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION EDUCATION PROGRAM </h3>

<p>SAREP analysts <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> and Chuck Ingels are participating as mentors
in the Agricultural Production and Education Program, which was started
by Winters walnut grower Craig McNamara. This is a pilot program designed
to offer high school students firsthand experience in sustainable agriculture
and on-farm research. The program, which began in 1994, is being coordinated
by Sandy Creighton and Mark Linder of the California Foundation for Agriculture
in the Classroom. In the first year, it involved six students from each
of four high schools from Northern California. Students worked on projects
with the assistance of four UC Davis mentors, including Mike Singer, soil
scientist in the UCD land, air and water resources department, Frank Zalom,
director of the Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project, and Bugg
and Ingels. Students participated in walnut harvest, planted cover crops,
attached cardboard bands to trees for codling moth control, and built and
installed barn owl boxes. Students also conducted research projects and
toured UCD research facilities. In 1995, the project expanded to two additional
schools. The program is being evaluated and promoted by Linda Whent, lecturer
in the agronomy and range science department. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN SPANISH </h3>

<p>Spanish language materials about sustainable agriculture farming practices
are now available at five California sites:the UC Davis Small Farm Center,
the Rural Development Center in Salinas, the UC Cooperative Extension offices
in Fresno and San Diego, and at the Center for Chicano Studies at UC Santa
Barbara. Seventy-four Spanish documents at each site describe practical
information about alternative agriculture practices appropriate for small-scale,
entry-level Hispanic farmers, farm advisors or others who work with this
population. All of these documents have been summarized in English and
appear in A Guide to Spanish Language Sustainable Agriculture Publications
(see Publications section, p. 44). </p>

<h3>MEDIA OUTREACH </h3>

<p>In addition to direct outreach via meetings, workshops or program publications,
SAREP gets information to farmers, researchers, agricultural professionals,
policy makers and consumers through the popular press (newspapers, magazines,
radio and television), the agricultural trade press, professional journals
and postings to the Internet. Press releases about research projects, specific
farming practices, workshops, symposia and other program activities sent
out via mail, electronic mail and Internet discussion group postings have
prompted numerous print and broadcast news stories in California, the nation
and the world. </p>

<p>Between July 1993 and July 1995 articles have appeared in the Los Angeles
Times, the Washington Post, the Hokkaido Shimbun Press (Sapporo, Japan),
the Chicago Tribune, the Sacramento Bee, the San Francisco Examiner, the
Topeka Kansas Capital-Journal, the San Francisco Bay-Guardian, Organic
Gardening, Sunset Magazine, Business Week, and numerous smaller state and

<h3>EDUCATION FOR EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS </h3>

<p>A new USDA program for professional education in sustainable agriculture
was initiated in 1994. Funding was made available under the 1990 Farm Bill
(Title XVI, Subtitle B, Chapter 3) for each state to develop a statewide
strategic plan for professional development, targeting Cooperative Extension
(CE) advisors, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) field staff,
and other agricultural consultants. SAREP coordinated this activity in
California. </p>

<p>Our planning process centered around three focus groups, which were
held in November and December of 1994 in Merced, Riverside and Davis. The
purposes of these meetings were to better define the educational needs
and interests of the target </p>

<h2>Activities </h2>

<p>audiences, and identify the methods and strategies that would be most
successful in meeting those needs. More than 60 individuals participated
in the focus groups including CE advisors and county directors from each
of its four regions, NRCS field staff, farmers, and representatives of
several UC programs and non-profit organizations involved in sustainable
agriculture education. </p>

<p>Since the target audiences for the Chapter 3 program are initially CE
and the NRCS, the participation of advisors and field staff from these
organizations was especially important. The plan builds on the considerable
expertise and ongoing work of California's CE and NRCS personnel in extending
information about sustainable agriculture, and aims to enhance their work
with farms, ranches and communities across the state. </p>

<p>Much of the discussion that took place during the planning meetings
focused on enriching the educational efforts that are already underway
and strengthening the programs of the many organizations and groups in
California involved in sustainable agriculture education. In summary, the
planning groups recommended a three-part approach that: </p>

<ul>
<li>builds on existing educational programs; </li>

<li>provides focused programs and farm tours on high priority topics and
issues; and </li>

<li>strengthens extension teams and networks addressing related problems
and issues. </li>
</ul>

<p>These components and the assessment of educational needs and interests
of the target audiences are described in detail in the planning document
which is available from SAREP. </p>

<h2 align=center>LONG-TERM<a name="LONG-TERM"></a> RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEMS </h2>

<p>In addition to funding competitive research grants and distributing
information, the UC 
<br>Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program is charged by
the California Legislature to answer questions about the long-term effects
of agricultural practices. Most of the chemical, biological and physical
processes that define the sustainability and environmental impacts of agricultural
practices occur over long time periods ranging from ten to 100 years. Many
scientists agree that the answers to the questions about long-term impacts
can only be obtained through extended field experiments. Long-term farmland
research sites are field laboratories for on-going studies of fundamental
processes and mechanisms that influence the sustainability of agricultural
systems. While the emphasis of long-term studies is on research and data
collection over a long period, information can be gathered and distributed
continuously. 
<br>
<br>In fiscal year 1989/90, SAREP provided $150,000 to a project entitled,
&quot;Long-term Research on Agricultural Systems: Crop Diversity and Input
Level as Determinants of Function and Evolution of the Agroecosystem&quot;
(LTRAS), involving a team of 18 researchers at UC Davis. This one-time
award was given to help establish the first long-term research facility
in irrigated agriculture in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.
LTRAS is located on 300 acres in Yolo County and is directed by R. Ford
Denison, agronomy and range science deparment, UC Davis. LTRAS represents
a major commitment of University of California partners to the sustainability
of California agriculture. The LTRAS project addresses questions about
the appropriate level and nature of inputs to define a sustainable agricultural
system that meets our requirement for food and for the environment. The
UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences committed almost
$550,000 in matching resources to this site from 1990-1993, and $155,000
for FY 1993/94. The project continues to receive major support from the
college. It also recently received a $275,000 National Research Initiative
(NRI) grant from USDA. </p>

<p>The first experiment on the site, which was started in late 1993, is
a 60-acre comparison of annual cropping systems that include rotations
with wheat, corn, tomatoes, and winter legume cover crops. Initially, the
experiment included ten cropping systems that differ in reliance on external
inputs of irrigation water and nitrogen, and included a two-year organic
corn/tomato rotation. Long-term trends in key soil properties, such as
organic matter, weed seeds, pH, and salinity, are being monitored. Resulting
differences in yield, resource use efficiency, profitability, and environmental
impact (such as leaching of nitrate or pesticides) will be used to evaluate
the sustainability of these cropping systems. LTRAS is expected to make
important contributions to agricultural science within a few years, as
well as over the long-term. In FY 1993/94, SAREP paid for pest management
consulting services provided by Kerry Beane, an expert in IPM and organic
methods. In FY 1994/95, SAREP awarded $10,000 to Denison to establish a
new four-year organic rotation (s<i>ee Sustainable Agricultural Production
Grants, p. 36) .</i> </p>

<h2 align=center>BIOLOGICALLY<a name="BIOLOGICALLY"></a> INTEGRATED FARMING
SYSTEMS (BIFS) 
<br>Field Crops Row Crops Orchards Vineyards </h2>

<p>Results from successful Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
projects inspired 
<br>new enabling legislation (Assembly Bill 3383), which was passed unanimously
by both houses of the California legislature and signed into law by Governor
Pete Wilson in late 1994. Under AB 3383, UC SAREP awards grants through
a competitive process for pilot demonstration projects to help farmers
learn about &quot;biologically integrated farming systems&quot; (BIFS).
Projects were proposed for wine grapes, cotton, various field and vegetable
crops, citrus, and pears. Proposals were evaluated by the Program Advisory
Review Board, as designated in AB 3383. 
<br></p>

<p>The California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency have provided funding of $670,000 for projects to begin
in FY 1995/1996 and beyond. Additional funding will be needed to fully
fund the five pilot projects that are specified in the legislation. 
<br></p>

<p>In early August 1995, the first two projects were funded and are described
below. These projects are not covered in the financial report. We will
be reporting on these and other BIFS projects in future progress reports.

<p>This participatory extension and research project is designed to facilitate
information exchange among farmers, consultants and researchers on biologically
integrated farming practices within the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley
(SJV). It is modeled on the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
projects, which have been developed primarily for a single, permanent crop.
In this project, participating farmer, university and private and public
agency members have embraced the BIOS spirit, but modified the approach
to best match the rotational cropping patterns of Central Valley row crop
farmers. The project will monitor and evaluate on-farm demonstrations of
soil-building practices and options for reduced reliance on agrichemicals,
determine the extent to which integrated pest management practices are
used in row crops on the West Side, and identify problems preventing further
adoption. It will provide community demonstrations of technologies while
making use of participatory research teams to develop and refine additional
information. The project will provide technical assistance to farmers and
their consultants, and intensive pest management monitoring of fields enrolled
in the project. Side-by-side comparisons between conventionally managed
and biologically-based production systems will be established on the 13
cooperator farms. In each of the biologically integrated parcels, cover
crops and composted organic materials will be integrated into rotations
wherever appropriate, while in the conventionally managed parcels, mineral
fertilizer applications will be made. A common West Side crop rotation
of tomatoes/cotton/onions-garlic will be followed at most sites. Pest management
practices will be evaluated and alternatives will be developed through
a participatory process. On-farm pest management demonstrations, hands-on
training, and field workshops will provide invaluable links with work groups
and task forces. While this program focuses primarily on annual cropping
systems of the Huron/Five Points area, the findings and results of these
activities will be applicable to the entire western side of the SJV which
is 200 miles long and 20 miles wide and extends from Los Banos to Bakersfield.

<h2 align=center>IMPLEMENTING A BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING 
<br>SYSTEM FOR WINE GRAPES IN THE LODI-WOODBRIDGE

<p><b>Budget: 
<br></b><i>FY 95-96: $100,000</i> </p>

<p><b>Investigators: 
<br></b><i>Mark Chandler, executive director, Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape

Department of Entomological Sciences, UC Berkeley</i> </p>

<p>Grapes are the leading economic crop grown in California, with a total
value of over $1.6 billion (CDFA, 1994). In 1988 more than 1 million pounds
of insecticides and one-quarter million pounds of miticides were applied
to vineyards to control pests. The Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission
includes 650 growers on 46,000 acres of vineyards. The BIFS wine grape
project is based on biologically integrated farming methods that the Commission
began developing in 1992 to reduce chemical pesticide use, promote effective
and rapid adoption of sustainable wine grape production practices, and
promote economic development in San Joaquin County by cultivating a market
niche for wine grapes produced with more environmentally sensitive practices.
Prototype vineyards have dramatically reduced the use of pesticides and
synthetic fertilizers while maintaining crop yield and quality through
the use of cover crops and composts, weed management using more environmentally
sensitive cultural practices, careful monitoring of mite and insect populations,
mite management through release of mite predators, encouraging natural
enemies by establishing refuges, and the conversion of some vineyards to
drip irrigation. With the cooperation of district growers the Commission
is implementing BIFS on 30 vineyards comprising 1,921 acres. To ensure
the success of the program the commission has assembled cooperators and
a management team made up of the Statewide IPM Project director, a University
of California scientist pivotal in the development of IPM, a University
of California Cooperative Extension viticulture farm advisor, consultants
experienced in implementing BIFS technologies, pest control advisors, and
growers. Participating farms were evaluated by the BIFS team at the onset
of the project and will be monitored seasonally. The Commission is conducting
ongoing side-by-side comparisons of yields and pesticide use between the
BIFS-farmed blocks and conventionally farmed blocks on the farms of cooperating
growers. The results of the comparisons will be made available with other
project data at monthly grower meetings, field days, smaller neighborhood
grower meetings, seminars, and in monthly newsletters.</p>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Purple Vetch (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B> L.; <I>Vicia atropurpurea</I></B> Desf. has been deemed a synonym (Munz, 1973; Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Purple vetch tolerates soil pH of 4.8-8.2, with a mean of 7 cases of 6.7; it is said to tolerate high pH (Duke, 1981).  By contrast, Munoz & Graves (1988) stated that it is suited to neutral to acid soil.  Peaceful Valley (1988) stated that the species tolerates low pH.<P> Purple vetch is said to show more growth, hardiness and N fixation on neutral soils (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Purple vetch is fall-sown in the Southeast and on the Pacific Coast, but spring sown in the northern states Duke (1981).  In other words, sow in fall where mild winters prevail and in spring where winters are severe (McLeod, 1982).<P> In California, suggested planting dates include early fall (Goar, 1934; Munoz & Graves, 1988), and October-November (because delayed seeding may result in cold soils and poor stands) (Madson, 1951).<P> Cantisano (pers. comm.) remarked that in much of California, purple vetch can be planted as late as December, but maximum growth will result from September or October seeding.<P> McKee (1922) stated that seeding dates vary regionally and according to the purpose of the crop.  In western Oregon and Washington, purple vetch should be fall sown immediately after the first rains, or in February or March.  April seedings suffice where spring comes late, but if rain ceases early, late plantings may yield poorly.  Seed during fall in California west of the Sierra Nevada, in southern Nevada, and in the southwestern half of Arizona.  For green manuring with irrigation, plant from mid-August to mid-September.  For hay in California without irrigation, sow on fallow land in the fall before the winter rains.<P> Goar (1934) suggested fall (October or November) seeding in the interior valleys.  For both pasture and hay, seeding should be no later than October 20.  In coastal and foothill areas, delays are tolerable.  In Marin and Alameda counties, December to January 1 plantings have succeeded.  Lacking irrigation, delay seeding until rains begin.  If land has been summer-fallowed and weeds are not a serious threat, seeding may be done in the "dust," as was successful at Ahwahnee.<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Purple vetch was termed an annual by Munz (1973) and McKee (1922).  By contrast, Hermann (1960) stated that it is an annual or biennial, and rarely perennial.  Duke (1981) termed purple vetch a straggling, climbing, or trailing annual or short-lived perennial herb.  It is fall-sown in the Southeast and on the Pacific Coast, but spring sown in the northern states Duke (1981).<P> Like common vetch, purple vetch should be fall-planted (Goar, 1934), after which it grows vigorously from January through May (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates have been suggested: 56-67 pounds/acre as green manure in vegetable system (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 25-50 pounds/acre in rotation with cereal (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 50-60 pounds/acre (McLeod, 1982), 30-60 pounds/acre (Miller, 1988), 40-80 pounds/acre (Peaceful Valley, 1988), 52 pounds per acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983), 50 to 65 lbs/acre (Madson, 1951), 50 to 65 lbs/acre (Miller et al. 1989), 60 to 80 lbs/acre (McKee, 1922), 56-67 kg/ha (Duke, 1981), 40 lbs/acre in mixture with grain (grain sown at half the monocultural rate) (McKee, 1922).<P> 56 lbs/acre are required to plant 12 vetch seeds per square foot, or 522,720 seeds per acre (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cost of purple vetch seed ranges from $0.45 to 0.90 /lb, depending on volume and demand (Cantisano, pers. comm.).  The cost is $0.90 /lb, according to Munoz & Graves (1988).  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price as $0.55/lb in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Nitrogen contents for purple vetch have been variously presented as 50-200 pounds/acre N in vegetable/green manure system (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 50-100 pounds/acre in rotation with cereal (lower seeding rate) (Munoz & Graves, 1988), up to 300 pounds of N per acre between October and the end of April in northern California (Miller, 1988), the equivalent of 80 lbs/acre of fertilizer nitrogen when followed by sugar beets in trails at Davis and Santa Maria (Miller et al., 1989), and in unirrigated pasture, about 53 lb/a of nitrogen (Holland et al., 1969).  In a vineyard study in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, purple vetch showed a mean biomass yield of 10.117, which based on 10-20% protein containing 6.25% N projects to above-ground N content of 63.23-126.46 kg N/ha.<P> Like many other legumes, purple vetch fixes more N when soil N is restricted, but P, S, and Ca are readily available (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> Available N from purple vetch can be estimated by multiplying harvested fresh weight of cover crop from a sixteen square feet (4 x 4 ft.) sample plot by 16 (result is in lbs of N/acre) (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Purple vetch tolerates annual precipitation of from 3.1-16.6 dm; the mean of 8 cases was 8.5.  The species requires moderate soil moisture, and is drought intolerant (Duke, 1981).  Munoz & Graves (1988) stated that purple vetch requires 20 inches of water.<P> According to Goar (1934), if rainfall is late, vetch should be irrigated about October 1.  In the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, the crop will mature without additional irrigation if soils have good moisture-holding capacity.  April irrigation may be needed in lieu of spring rains.  On light soils, three to five irrigations may be needed.  Both near the coast and in the foothills, good yields are usually produced with normal rainfall (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Inoculant type "C" is used with purple vetch (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Inoculation of purple vetch is mandatory on most soils, and it costs about $2.00 per 100 pounds of seed (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Purple vetch should be turned under at flowering in vegetable systems or in rotation with cereal when seeding the latter (Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Purple vetch is easier to incorporate if mowed first (Peaceful Valley, 1988), and the residue breaks down easily after disking (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P> When overseeded into rice, rice yields are greater when the vetch is turned under 4 to 6 inches than when it is placed shallower. Reducing the time interval between turning under the vetch and flooding and sowing the rice also increases yields, if nitrification is rapid during the preflooding period.  Properly incorporated vetch is equivalent to ammonium nitrogen in increasing rice yields (Williams and Finrock, 1963).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Purple vetch has been used for forage, cover crops, and green manures (McLeod, 1982).  It has been used as a green manure in vegetable systems (Munoz & Graves, 1988), in rotation with cereal crops (e.g., rice) (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and for cover in Californian citrus (McLeod, 1982).  It is rated excellent for hay, green chop or forage when mixed with red or white oat (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> McKee (1922) stated that purple vetch is especially valuable compared to other winter annual legumes (including other vetches). In Californian orchards, purple vetch has shown heavier growth than field pea, common vetch, fenugreek, bur clover, and sourclover, all of which have been used extensively.  Purple vetch gives superior early growth, so can be incorporated earlier in spring.  This is important in southwestern citrus groves, where green manures should be turned under by mid-February or the first of March.  The total biomass production of purple vetch is seldom equalled.<P> Purple vetch is equal to common or hairy vetch for pasture, serving for all kinds of stock.  Where mild climates permit early fall seeding, it can provide pasturage in the fall and the following spring (McKee, 1922).<P> Purple vetch hay quality had not been formally assessed by the early twenties (McKee, 1922).  In preliminary feeding tests, livestock ate purple-vetch hay as readily as common-vetch hay, and chemical analyses suggested feeding value similar to that of common vetch.  The hairiness of purple vetch exceeds that of common vetch but is less than that of pubescent forms of hairy vetch; the latter has been much used for hay with no bad results, so the feature is probably inconsequential (McKee, 1922).  Duke (1981) stated that the protein content of purple vetch ranges from 10-20%, depending on developmental stage.<P> Murphy et al. (1976) stated that vetches are useful as a source of spring feed, but that they serve best as summer dry forage, or as a seed source for upland game birds.  Ground seed is used for poultry food (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Purple vetch has been variously said to tolerate mowing and grazing (Peaceful Valley, 1988) and to not respond favorably to mowing (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  It has been called difficult to mow due to its viney growth (McLeod, 1982) and not difficult to mow with a flail mower/chopper (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Duke's (1981) account mentions that purple vetch is tolerant of acid soil; that in western Oregon, gypsum is often applied at 85-167 kg/ha; that P and K may be applied in the Southeast; and that N fertilizers are seldom used.  Purple vetch has a low requirement for lime (McLeod, 1982), tolerates low fertility soils, but fixes maximum N on fertile, phosphorus-rich soils (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Purple vetch grows best if well supplied with calcium, sulfur, boron, phosphorus (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> McKee (1922) reported that purple vetch requires about the same amounts of lime and gypsum as common vetch receives in the South and in western Oregon and Washington.  In experiments at Corvallis, Oregon, lime or gypsum addition caused only a slight increase of seed or hay.  Well-drained soils of western Oregon and western Washington require little lime; other soils may benefit from lime: 1 to 2 tons per acre is recommended.  Gypsum can benefit most soils: 75 - 100 lbs/acre should be applied.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Suggested seeding depths include 1/4 to 3/4 inches (Cantisano, pers. comm.), 3/4 inches (McLeod, 1982), 1.5 to 2.5 inches depending on soil moisture (Goar, 1934), and 2 inches or more (Madson, 1951).  When planting is delayed until late in the season, seed should be planted closer to the surface (Madson, 1951).  Duke (1981) suggested a seeding depth of 10 cm (about 4 inches), which seems extremely deep in light of the seed size and the other recommendations quoted above (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Purple vetch seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Purple vetch is among the least hardy of the cultivated vetches; it overwinters in the milder parts of California, but cannot endure winters in the Cotton Belt, except in southern Georgia and Alabama (Duke, 1981).  McKee (1922) stated that purple vetch is winter hardy in all the milder parts of California and Arizona and that only in the mountains will the crop winter kill.  McKee (1922) regarded purple vetch as a little less winter hardy than common vetch but as otherwise having similar climatic requirements.  Goar (1934) concurred, calling purple vetch less winter-hardy than common vetch and not likely to survive temperatures lower than 15 F. above zero.  McKee (1922) recounted that in severe winters in western Oregon, purple vetch was injured more than common vetch, but never entirely winterkilled.  Snow protection and the amount of moisture in the soil may affect overwintering; Mckee (1922) stated that under average conditions, purple vetch will stand a temperature of about 15 F. above zero with little or no injury. McLeod (1982) stated that purple vetch is injured at 10-15 degrees F with fluctuating temperatures.  Madson (1951) ascribed to it moderate resistance to cold, stating that it withstood temperatures of 20 F, but that it would be injured by prolonged periods at this temperature.  However, Goar (1934) also remarked that purple vetch makes more growth during the cool weather of winter than any other standard variety.  Madson (1951) wrote that Purple vetch usually makes more growth during the winter and early spring than most other vetches.  Peaceful Valley (1988) reported consistent, high yields where temperatures do not drop below 20 degrees F.  Miller (1988) termed purple vetch "resistant to frost," and later stated that it does well in all sections where winter temperatures do not fall below 20 F (Miller et al., 1989).  Williams, 1964 stated that 'Certified' purple vetch suffered no damage from temperatures of 21 F in 1963.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Purple vetch tolerates most types of soil, but does best on rich loams (Duke, 1981).  Munoz & Graves (1988) stated that it is suited to loam to clay soil.  According to McLeod (1982), purple vetch grows best on well-drained loam or clay loam soils, but does fairly well on sandy or gravelly soils (McLeod, 1982).  Loam soils are recommended by Madson (1951).<P> Goar (1934) remarked that like common vetch, purple vetch is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions, doing best on fine-textured clay and clay-loam soils, but tolerating sandy loams and somewhat gravelly soils.  Soil should be well drained.<P> McKee (1922) stressed the importance of good drainage, and he wrote that purple vetch does best in heavy loams or clay loams but has done fairly well on sandy and gravelly soils.  In western Oregon, purple vetch sometimes did better on poorly drained land than common vetch, but good crops were not produced.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Purple vetch is a straggling, climbing or trailing annual or short-lived perennial herb, with stems 20-80 cm long.  Purple vetch is viny and succulent, often producing a matted carpet two feet deep by springtime (Miller, 1988).<P> Purple vetch has much the same habit of growth as common vetch (McKee, 1922).  The species has been termed the most vigorous vetch (Peaceful Valley, 1988), and is said to have moderate to heavy density of growth (Madson, 1951).  The species will grow upright when mixed with grain/grasses to support viney growth (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Munz (1973) describes purple vetch as a soft pubescent annual attaining a height of 3-8 dm.  Duke (1981) called the plant a straggling, climbing, or trailing annual or shortlived perennial. Madson (1951) remarked on the vigorous viny growth and the marked hairiness or pubescence.  Purple vetch produces a compact raceme or cluster of purple flowers borne on a long stem, or peduncle, arising from the axis of the leaf.  Leaves are compound, made up of several pairs of leaflets, but without a terminal leaflet.<P> Hermann (1960) described purple vetch as softly white-hairy; stems weak, angular, and striate, 1 to 2 m. long; leaves all bearing prominent, branched tendrils; leaflets 10 to 16, oval to oblong, 2 to 3 cm. long, usually blunt but mucronate; stipules rather large, semisagittate, dentate; flowers 2 to 12, large (13 to 18 mm.), in a rather close, secund raceme, all opening at the same time; calyx not, or only slightly, gibbous at the base, the teeth prolonged, subulate, the lower 3 to 4 mm., the upper 2 to 3 mm. long; corolla narrow, whitish at the base, dark purple above, the blade of the standard much shorter than the claw; pod narrowly oblong, broad, 25 to 35 mm. by 8 to 12 mm., pubescent.<P> By Goar's (1934) description, the leaf has seven to nine pairs of leaflets, and is long, oval, and terminated by a tendril.  The leaflets, and to a lesser extent the stems, are covered with numerous fine hairs, which give the plant as a whole a silvery-grayish appearance.  Unlike common vetch, the flowers of this variety are borne in showy clusters of twenty or more purple flowers, which hang more or less to one side of the flower stem.<P> McKee's (1922) description follows: The length of the stems is usually from 3 to 6 feet.  From seven to nine pairs of leaflets, terminated with a tendril, consititure the leaf.  The leaflets are long, oval, and covered with down, giving the plant a silvery gray cast.  Twenty or more amaranth-purple flowers are borne in numerous conspicuous clusters.  The plump, hairy pods, from 1 to 1.5 inches in length, contain from four to five seeds.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The plump, hairy pods, from 1 to 1.5 inches in length, contain from four to five seeds of a solid velvety black, with a prominent white scar at the point of attachment to the pod (McKee, 1922). The scar is termed a hilum or eye (Madson, 1951).  The hilum encircles 1/5 of the seed (Hermann, 1960).<P> Seed are compressed subglobose, the subquadrate, 4 to 5 mm. in diameter (Hermann, 1960), and, according to McKee (1922), about the same size as common vetch seed, i.e., practically the size of wheat.  According to Goar (1934), seed are slightly smaller than common vetch seeds and fairly uniform in shape and size.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) stated that purple vetch does best near the coast, where it outyields common vetch, and that it grows more during the winter than any other standard variety.  In past trials, purple vetch produced yields (presumably fresh weight) of 12 to 15 tons of green matter per acre at Davis and well over 20 tons in the Imperial Valley (Madson, 1951).<P> McKee (1922) reported hay yields (presumably dry weight) of 1.5 to 3.5 tons per acre, with the mean being about 2.5 tons.<P> Bugg et al. (unpublished data) reported that purple vetch was seeded during October, 1990, and biomass harvested May 15-16, 1991, in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Dry above-ground biomass for purple vetch was 10.117+/-0.535 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.).  This was the highest absolute yield obtained for any of the 19 legumes assessed, but was only significantly greater than biennial sweetclovers, strawberry clover, and mixed ladino and strawberry clovers.  Biomass of purple vetch plus weeds was 10.834+/-0.810 (Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Seed should by drilled deep enough to contact moist soil and can be planted 2 in.  or more in depth.  Late seedings should be at lesser depths (Madson,1951).<P> Purple vetch seed can be broadcast or drilled; it can be overseeded into existing stands of rice, corn, etc.  (Cantisano, pers. comm.).  Drilling leads to better germination and less winterkilling than does broadcasting seed (McKee, 1922).  Drilling ensures more uniform depth of seeding, and better germination and stand (Goar, 1934).<P> According to Goar (1934) seedbed for vetches should be firm and well prepared.  Lacking irrigation, summer-fallowed land should be worked lightly after the first rains in the fall to destroys the first weeds and create seed bed.<P> If rainfall is late, pre-irrigation about October 1, followed by disking or spring-tooth harrowing and rolling, floating, or otherwise smoothing the surface.  Seed vetch by October 15 (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>'Certified': this is a composite of purple vetch germplasm in California, with no characters distinguishing it from other forms of purple vetch (Williams, 1964).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Purple vetch should be cut for hay between full bloom and formation of the first pods (McKee, 1922).  Goar (1934) recommended that it is best for hay when cut in full bloom. Vetch leaves dry much faster than the stems, so hay should be handled rapidly in the field to minimize loss of leaves (Goar, 1934).  One day in the swath ususally suffices, then the hay is put in shocks to complete curing (Goar, 1934).<P> McKee (1922) wrote that when purple vetch is grown for seed, it should be cut soon after the lower pods are ripe.  Upper pods mature earlier, so seed load will be maximal.  Later cutting causes pods to drop; earlier cutting increases the proportion of immature seed.  Purple vetch shatters less readily than common vetch, but the likelihood increases when seed are overripe; also pods drop without bursting.  The guiding principle in harvesting vetch seed is to handle the crop as quickly and as little as possible.<P> Duke stated that purple vetch should be harvested when 75-90% of the pods are mature.  Combine harvesting is practical.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Purple vetch is assigned to the Mediterranean Center of Diversity, ranging from the Warm Temperate Dry to Moist through the Subtropical Moist Forest Life Zone.  The species is native to the Mediterranean region of southern Europe from Azores east from Portugal; it is an escape in Kenya (Duke, 1981).<P> Munz (1973) reported that purple vetch is naturalized in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Robert L.  Bugg (pers. comm.) observed in mid-June 1992 that purple vetch volunteers in roadcuts and pastures on the campus at University of California at Santa Cruz. In general, it succeeds best near the coast (Goar, 1934). 'Certified' is adapted to valley and foothill sites up to 3,000 foot elevation in California, and its area of adaptation probably include western Oregon, western Washington, southern Georgia and Alabama (Williams, 1964).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>When grown for hay, silage, or soiling, the vetches and peas are usually mixed with seeds of one of the cereals, which will support the legume.  Oat is most commonly used, although rye, wheat, or barley are occasionally preferred by the growers (Goar, 1934).  Oat is especially suitable as an intercrop for vetch, because oat seed is more easily separable from vetch seed than are barley, cereal rye, or wheat (Duke, 1981).<P> By the account of Schenk and Werner (1991), various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound.  This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.<P> Vetch or Austrian winter pea is good in mixtures with oat in California because they mature at the same time (Goar, 1934).<P> When seeding with grain for hay purposes, seed about 40 lbs of purple vetch seed per acre and about half the amount of grain used when seeding grain alone (McKee, 1922).<P> Vetch is best for hay when cut in full bloom.  Oat makes good hay if cut when the grain is in the soft-dough stage.  When common, purple, or hairy vetch or Austrian Winter pea is used in combination with Kanota oat, legumes and oat usually mature at the same time.  For this reason, vetch and oat make a very good combination (Goar, 1934).<P> In California, mixtures of hairy vetch, purple vetch, common vetch, field pea, and oat are often used in cover cropping.  Bell bean and 'Lana' woolypod vetch can also be included (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>According to Bugg (pers. comm.), vetch is easier to mow with a flail than with rotary or sickle-bar mowers.  Incorporation with a light disk can be difficult because of binding.  Power spaders and rototillers are effective at incorporation; the former can be used on tall cover crops when soils are somewhat moist.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Flowers of purple vetch are attractive to bees (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and purple vetch is rated a good honey plant (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> Cantisano (pers. comm.) said that purple vetch attracts many species of beneficial insects: <I>Nabis</I></B>, <I>Orius</I></B>, assassin bugs, <I>Hippodamia</I></B> lady beetles, lacewings, and others, and that it is an excellent beneficial insectary.  However, it lacks the extrafloral nectaries that bell bean, bigflower vetch, and common vetch possess; this presumably makes purple vetch less attractive to parasitic wasps, lacewings, ants, and lady beetles; lygus bugs are also less likely to be abundant (Bugg, pers. comm.). Purple vetch is later maturing than several other species of vetch so might be expected to harbor beneficial insects later.<P> Flexner et al.  (1990) found that, in southern Oregonian pear orchards, certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems. Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, vetch appeared particularly prone to outbreaks of the mite.  Use of herbicides led to increased movement by mites into trees.<P> McKee (1922) noted that although aphids have caused serious damage to purple-vetch, more damage is typically done to field pea, common vetch, and other leguminous crops.  This can lead to seed and biomass yield reductions.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Purple vetch, with its viny habit, will grow up most grasses, weeds or other plants in the mix.  It has been termed good for smothering winter weeds (Peaceful Valley, 1988), and excellent for controlling star thistle in pastures (pers. comm.).<P> In plots seeded to purple vetch during late October, 1990, in Hopland, Mendocino County, California harvest on May 15-16, 1991, showed that weed above-ground biomass (dry) was 0.717+/-0.566 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which was 14.6% of the weed biomass in control plots (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherd's purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  In early May vegetational cover was 95.00+/-2.04 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.) by purple vetch (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> As reported by Schenk and Werner (1991), various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and apparently is an allelopathic compound.  This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.<P>

<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Livestock will avoid purple vetch when it is green but will readily eat it when it is dry.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that purple vetch harbors the following plant-parasitic nematodes: <I>Heterodera glycines</I></B> (original reference, Riggs, 1962), <I>H. goettingiana</I></B> (original reference, Oostenbrink, 1951), <I>H.  schachtii</I></B> (original reference, Raski, 1952), <I>H.  trifolii</I></B> (original reference, Oostenbrink, 1951), and <I>Pratylenchus vulnus</I></B> (original reference, Jensen, 1953).<P> <I>H.  goettingiana</I></B> is not important in California. (Oostenbrink, 1951), nor is <I>Heterodera glycines</I></B> (Riggs, 1962).<P> <I>Meloidogyne javanica</I></B> and <I>Xiphinema americanum</I></B> have been found associated with this cover crop in vineyards, but greenhouse testing is needed for confirmation (McKenry, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>Purple vetch cover reduces soil temperature slightly and increases humidity (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> Young (1922) reported an unreplicated study upon which have been based many subsequent generalizations about cover-crop effect on temperatures in citrus groves.  A 6-acre grove was divided into 2, 3-acre sections.  A cover crop of sourclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B>, 30 lb/a) mixed with rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>, 10 lb/a) and some purple vetch (<I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B>) was established. Locations of two temperature stations were assigned based on similarity of low temperatures when dense cover crops were present in both sections.  On January 18, 1922, the northern half of the orchard was ploughed, but the cover crop in the southern half was left intact.  Conditions were wet during this study.  Temperature measurements were made for 16 nights of frost, including the exceptionally-cold spell from Januay 19-23, which included the coldest weather in southern California since 1913.  Sheltered thermometers showed that 10 inches above the ground, the cover-cropped plot was, on average, approximately 2 degrees F colder than the clean-cultivated plot during the night.  The only effect at 5 feet above ground was to decrease the rate of temperature rise during the morning.  Unsheltered thermometers showed that depression of minimum temperatures was about 2.4 degrees F at 7 inches above the ground, and 0.4 degrees F at 24 inches above the ground.  At times when air temperatures were falling rapidly, the temperature at 7 inches could be as much as 11 degrees colder in the cover-cropped plot.  The results suggest that cover crops do increase the risk of frost, but only to a slight extent.<P> Young (1925) also conducted another unreplicated study, a followup on the previous unreplicated study about cover-crop effect on temperatures in citrus groves (Young 1922).  The results conform in large measure with those of the prior study.  A 10-acre grove of navel and Valencia oranges was divided into 2, 5-acre sections.  A cover crop was established of purple vetch (<I>Vicia benghalensis</I></B>), Broad Windsor horse bean (<I>Vicia faba</I></B>) and many tall weeds.  Conditions were dry during this study.  Locations of two temperature stations were assigned near the center of each plot when dense cover crops were present in both sections.  On January 4, 1924, the eastern half of the orchard was ploughed, but the cover crop in the western half was left intact.  Temperature measurements were then made for 24 nights of frost.  Sheltered thermometers showed that 10 inches above the ground, the cover-cropped plot was, on average, approximately 1.3 degrees F colder than the clean-cultivated plot during the night.  The difference at 5 feet above ground was 0.5 degrees.  The results again suggest that cover crops do increase the risk of frost, but only to a slight extent.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Purple vetch gives fair erosion control when plant is well established or in areas of natural reseeding.  Control is better when purple vetch is mixed with grasses and grains (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Purple vetch shows no adverse effects except attraction of honeybees when in flower.  A vetch cover crop makes the ground firmer for winter/rainy field work (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> Vetch cover crops can impede walking through orchards, so can reduce access for winter activities (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Purple vetch may increase the potential for foliar disease in orchards if allowed to grow over two feet tall during spring (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Purple vetch harbors voles, gophers, and their predators (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Purple vetch is moderately shade tolerant, showing better growth in full sun (Cantisano, pers. comm.).  It is commonly used in mixture with common vetch, hairy vetch, field pea, and oat in orchard cover crops (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Cantisano (pers. comm.) remarked that seed availability for purple vetch is excellent in most years but was low in 1988 due to drought.  Seed is produced under dryland conditions.  Purple vetch needs spring rains for seed development.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>According to Munz (1973), flowering is from May through June. However, precise flowering dates depend on planting dates. Purple vetch begins flowering in March or April in most sites (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Vetches mature in late spring or early summer (Duke, 1981). Purple vetch matures in four to eight months, depending on climate and annual rainfall (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Yields of vetches vary from 25-30 bu/ha, with 50-67 bu/ha the maximum (Duke, 1981).  Purple vetch yeilds vary: 10 bushels is low; 30 to 35 bu/a is near maximum; 12 to 20 bu/a is near the mean, or about the same as common vetch. In experimental plots at Corvallis, Oregon, yields ranged from 0 to 50 bushels per acre.  Total failure occurred during 1914-1915 due to the winterkilling of fall plantings.  In tests from 1915-1920, 80 and 100 pounds of seed sown per acre, yielded 21.8 and 24.5 bu/a of seed.  In commercial plantings in western Oregon, western Washington, and northwestern California the yields have ranged from 0 to 30 bushels per acre, with winterkilling causing the failures (McKee, 1922).<P> Seed yields depend on spring rainfall.  Purple vetch seed is difficult to harvest due to viny growth, but this can be done with grain combines with minor modifications (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P> For seed crops, light grazing in the spring reduces excessive vine growth, making harvesting easier.  Sheep do less trampling damage than other livestock (McKee, 1922).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Height estimates vary: 30-80 cm in height (11.8-31.5 inches) (Munz, 1973); 18 to 24 inches in monoculture (45.7 cm - 61.0 cm), but up to 36 inches (91.44 cm) when allowed to grow up grain/grass stems (Cantisano, pers. comm.); 57.15+/-4.46 cm, Mean +/- S.E.M. (22.5 +/- 1.8 inches) in monculture, Hopland, Mendocino County, California (Bugg et al., unpublished data).  The stems attain 3 to 6 feet in length or more (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Purple vetch has thick roots to a depth of one foot, and lesser roots to three feet or deeper (Cantisano, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Cantisano (pers. comm.) stated that establishment of purple vetch is easy if seed is sown when the ground is still warm in fall.  Establishment is slow when it is planted in winter, and the species shows fairly low vigor until after winter solstice.<P>

<P>
Sustainable agricultural systems involve animals for their unique
ability to use noncompetitive, nonrenewable resources, and for
their integration with other farm practices. They complement plant
production systems, and provide biological and economic diversity.
Management of such mixed or integrated systems is the greatest
challenge.<BR>

<P>
Forages are grown on over half the land area of the United States.
The economic success of forage farming requires animal grazing.
Nutrient cycling, soil-water conservation, and enterprise flexibility
are also affected. Animal reproductive cycles are timed to seasonal
availability of forage, and differences among species (nutrient
requirements, behavior, and diet preferences) allow the efficient
use of resources in both biological and economic terms. Controlled
intensive grazing, made possible by technological advances in
electrified fencing, has improved the economic and biological
output of animal-forage farming.<BR>

<P>
Sustainable cropping systems often emphasize the use of nitrogen-fixing
legumes for their value in soil improvement and as cover crops.
Increased production of these legumes, which improve animal performance,
should enhance the role of animals in these resource-conserving
systems. Animals can also use other crop residues, which are currently
produced in the United States in excess of amounts needed to prevent
serious soil erosion. Returning animal feces and urine to the
soil can help cycle nutrients, and animal grazing can help control
weeds in agroforestry or pasture systems. For example, sheep can
effectively control leafy spurge, a serious pest in the north
central United States and Canada which is toxic to cattle.<BR>

<P>
More attention should be paid to developing farming systems that
exploit the complementarity and synergism between plants and animals
in resource-conserving systems.<BR>

<H1>Rural development, biorefineries and the carbohydrate economy.
</H1>

<P>
<I>David Morris and Irshad Ahmend</I>
<P>
Institute for Local self-reliance. 1993
<P>
This provocative 12-page report describes an emerging &quot;carbohydrate
economy&quot; in which plants are used not only for food, feed,
paper and lumber, but as raw material for fuels and basic industrial
materials.  At the heart of this economy are locally-based biorefineries
which process plant materials-creating new markets for farmers
and boosting economic development in rural communities.  The report
suggests a new strategy for wedding many goals at the heart of
agricultural Sustainability, including the economic viability
of small to medium-scale farms, resource conservation, and a more
resilient rural economy linked to farming.
<P>
Drawing on government reports, university research, and recent
business experience, the authors describe two recent developments
that are making possible the carbohydrate economy.  Technological
advances in the material sciences make it possible to create high
quality, low cost fuels and industrial chemicals from plant matter.
 At the same time, political regulations on fossil fuels have
stiffened and raised their cost.  As a result, biofuels or biochemicals
are beginning to be competitive in cost with mineral-derived fuels
and chemicals.
<P>
For example, the cost of producing detergent enzymes, a partial
substitute for phosphates, has dropped by more than 70 percent,
while over half of the nation's states have enacted regulations
limiting or banning the use of phosphates in detergents.  Ethanol,
perhaps the most widely recognized biofuel, now can be produced
for about $ 1. 10 per gallon and competes well with gasoline additives
like MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) required by the Clean
Air Act.  Biomass generated electricity is becoming competitive
with coal, particularly because of expensive pollution control
technologies required on new coal-fired power plants.  New emission
standards for volatile organic compounds are spurring the substitution
of vegetable oils for mineral oils in inks and paints.
<P>
While virgin plant material will be the key feedstock of the carbohydrate
economy, agricultural wastes will also play an important initial
role.  By raising the cost of disposal, environmental regulations
make it increasingly attractive to recover agricultural wastes.
 The authors estimate that some 350 million tons of agricultural
wastes are currently taken from fields and available for processing.
 These waste materials include items such as cotton processing
wastes, rice straw, wheat straw, wood and pulp mill wastes, and
cheese whey from dairies, Agricultural waste-to-energy and chemical
facilities are beginning to emerge, including the first whey-to-ethanol
plants such as the one in Tulare, California.
<P>
Because plant matter is expensive to transport, it makes sense
for bioprocessing facilities to be modest in scale and located
near their raw material suppliers.  Based on experience to date,
the authors estimate that an -average size biorefinery might consume
100,000-300,000 tons of plant matter per year.  By recovering
agricultural wastes, and increasing the acreage of new carbohydrate
crops, the nation might easily produce 200 million tons of plant
matter, enough to supply 700-2,000 new biorefineries.  The higher
estimate would allow for one such facility in every rural county
in the nation.
<P>
By substituting native plant matter for imported petroleum, a
biorefinery-oriented economic development strategy can help meet
key national security and environmental goals.  It can also create
thousands of new jobs in rural areas and raise the prices farmers
receive for their crops.  If the biorefineries were organized
as producer cooperatives they could insure that the majority of
revenues created remain in the area to help the local economy,
rather than being siphoned out of the community by distant corporations.
 Finally, biorefineries could lead to spin-off businesses in the
area of cultivation or processing, providing for the type of regional
&quot;clustering&quot; that many economic experts believe will
be critical to success in the new global economy.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
The carbohydrate economy provides important new market possibilities
for farmers, as well as a realistic, agriculturally based economic
development tools for rural areas.  In its admittedly limited
applications to date, this development strategy is beginning to
strengthen the interconnections between farmers and rural development
planners, and provide an alternative to tourism as the key to
developing rural economies.
<P>
As the authors point out, a national policy to encourage biorefinery
development will need to be compatible with a continuing emphasis
on environmentally sound production practices.  If the new market
for fuels displaced needed food production, or if farmers rushed
to supply this new market by implementing practices that threatened
soils or water supplies, the strategy will not realize its potential
of being simultaneously environmentally benign and economically
viable.
<P>
This report presents new possibilities for sustainable agriculture
research.  Appropriate plant types (that could be raw materials
for biorefineries) need to be identified.  These new crops must
be introduced within the context of a whole production system,
and attention must be given to how these crops could be grown
in an environmentally sound manner.

<H1>Soil Management: Critical Key to Transition</H1>
<P>
<I>by Bill Liebhardt, SAREP &amp; Matthew Werner, UC Santa Cruz
Agroecology Program<BR>
</I>
<P>
The transition to more sustainable farming practices should be
thought of as a farming system level change that includes markets,
people, attitudes, management and those physical, chemical and
biological processes that affect the behavior of organisms.  An
important part of the transition involves soil management.  It
is not inert material which holds up plants or something that
we must drive tractors over. It is true that soil has a certain
percent of sand, silt and clay which by themselves, are biologically
inert.  However, all soils have organic matter, made of material
that was once living or is living, which supports a complex biological
system.
<H3>Homeland</H3>
<P>
The soil is home to a diverse array of organisms.  Some soil microorganisms
make their own food (as do crop plants), others obtain nourishment
directly from the products of organic breakdown and decay, while
others are predators, parasites, or live in a symbiotic relationship
with another organism.  The soil microorganisms include bacteria,
fungi (including yeasts), algae, and protozoans.  The soil animal
community is dominated by invertebrates including nematodes, mites,
collembola (springtails),  other  insects,  and  earthworms. 
Nematodes are commonly known as plant root parasites, but most
soil-dwelling species participate in organic  matter  decomposition.
 Non-parasitic nematodes are especially abundant when organic
matter levels are high.  Soil arthropods (primarily mites and
collembola) influence microbes, nematodes, and other invertebrates
by feeding on them, incorporating organic residues into the soil,
and by inoculating fresh residues with decomposer organisms. 
Earthworms and other larger invertebrates influence decomposition
processes, and also have significant effects on soil structural
development.
<H3>Soil Building</H3>
<P>
Biological activity helps create stable aggregates which result
in soils with better tilth and physical condition.  How do we
get soil aggregates?  Soil polysaccharides and iron oxides are
binding agents that cause soil mineral particles and organic matter
to adhere together as an aggregate.  Polysaccharides are simply
carbohydrate materials produced by soil organisms.  We increase
polysaccharide content by adding organic carbon (organic matter)
to the soil.  It is thought that when we add organic matter to
the soil, microbial processes and spontaneous chemical reactions
produce humus.  We are adding complex organic material which microbes
break down to simple materials, and then further re-synthesize
these to complex materials.  It has been theorized that in this
process random non-ordered materials are produced in the humus-building
process that microbes cannot attack.  This may account for the
longevity of some fractions or parts of soil organic matter. 
It also supports the contention that it is more than a microbial
process, because a rule of biochemistry is &quot;What microbes
can build, they can break down.&quot;
<H3>Transition</H3>
<P>
Transition to more sustainable farming practices is the basis
of good pest and crop stress management.  It is a preventive management
strategy that may help avoid these problems.  It is the start
of a management strategy to improve production and potentially
reduce chemical input costs and increase the efficiency of both
internal and external inputs.  A question that might arise is
&quot;What and how do we change if we want to change?&quot;  We
need to find a way to manage crops so that soil biological activity
is enhanced.  Ways to do so include returning organic matter to
soil, minimized disturbance through tillage, reduced synthetic
chemical use, crop rotation, and the use of animal manures.
<H3>Organic Matter Management</H3>
<P>
Organic matter management is a major part of our strategy.  We
can return organic matter to the soil by incorporating green manure
cover crops, manure, compost or crop residues.   Does organic
matter management change soil behavior in California?  We believe
we can say, &quot;Yes it does.&quot;   Farmers and researchers
have examples and data to demonstrate that effect.  Researchers
studying the connection between cover crops and water infiltration
include Pete Christensen, Terry Prichard, D.W. Grimes, D.A. Goldhamer,
Daniel Munk and W.A. Williams.  Other work has shown that a cover
crop of vetch also reduces crusting which aids seed germination
and emergence (Groody &amp; Singer, SAREP RFP87.077/Shennan).
 Research in progress is showing that organic matter is very important
in maintenance of soil potassium availability (SAREP RFP87.094/Cassman
&amp; Roberts).  A fertile soil in this sense then is a soil which
supplies adequate nutrients and has both biological and physical
characteristics that produce healthy plants.  It is also clear
that fertile soil is not just a pile of inert material with sufficient
N, P &amp; K.  For example, we could fertilize concrete pavement
perfectly and still not produce anything.
<H3>Tillage</H3>
<P>
Physical disturbance of the soil caused by tillage is a crucial
factor in determining structure and function of biological communities
in agroecosystems.  Tillage disturbs the top six to ten inches
of soil, and a more or less homogeneous plow zone replaces differentiated
surface soil horizons.  Frequent disturbance of the topsoil causes
a decrease in the diversity of species that can in-habit the soil
ecosystem. Various methods of tillage cause different degrees
of disturbance.  Many organic production systems do not differ
from conventional practices in terms of the degree of disturbance
caused by tillage.  It is helpful to think in terms of what practices
contribute to a food production system that is sustainable over
the long-term.
<P>
The effects of tillage are often relative to the size of soil
organisms.  Single-cell microbes may respond positively to aeration
and increased food availability, while large invertebrates may
be selected against by the disruption of their habitats and direct
physical injury.<BR>
<P>
Populations of most soil animals are initially reduced by tillage.
 Nematodes may recover the most rapidly of any group, while springtail
communities are not changed greatly by cultivation.  Tillage favors
organisms with short life cycles, rapid dispersal, and small body
size, and species with these characteristics may actually benefit
from mechanical disturbance, in much the same way that weedy plant
species flourish in agricultural or other disturbed ecosystems.
 The most successful groups in plowed soils may be those with
a resistant life stage.
<P>
Earthworms, however, are usually harmed by tillage.  In general,
the greater the intensity and frequency of disturbance, the lower
their population density.  Lowered soil moisture caused by cultivation
tends to hurt them.
<H3>Synthetic Chemical Use</H3>
<P>
Management practices that add nutrients to the soil tend to enhance
soil biological activity.  However, any positive effects of synthetic
fertilizers occur indirectly, through the stimulation of plant
growth which then provides a food source for soil animals.  Application
of fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate, urea, or super-phosphate
have demonstrated toxic effects on soil animals.  The application
of inorganic fertilizers to experimental plots at the Rothamstead
Experiment Station in England for 118 years caused decreases in
earthworms and microarthropods.<BR>
<P>
In the past several decades an enormous array of biocide formulations
have been produced and applied in attempts to control key pests
in agricultural systems.  Many of the fungicide, insecticide,
and fumigant formulations are very toxic to soil organisms.  Herbicides
are generally the least toxic, although direct toxic effects of
some herbicides on soil invertebrates have been demonstrated in
the lab.<BR>
<P>
In field studies, direct toxic effects of herbicides on soil organisms
have not been convincingly demonstrated, yet reports of problems
are common.  Direct toxicological effects may play a role, but
most researchers conclude that reductions in soil organisms or
activity are mainly due to indirect effects caused by a loss in
primary productivity, lowered organic matter, and the loss of
vegetative and litter cover.  Earthworms and other organisms need
habitat and a food source.
<P>
Application methods may have unique effects on soil animals. 
Surface feeding earthworms are most susceptible to surface applications
of the fungicide benomyl, and are less affected by incorporation
of the biocide into the soil.  Species like nightcrawlers <I>(Lumbricus
terrestris) </I>form permanent burrows, and do not come into contact
with subsurface soil beyond their burrow.  However, deeper-dwelling
species which continuously extend their burrows as they feed in
the subsurface soil, are most susceptible when benomyl is incorporated.
 Surface dwelling springtails may be more affected by herbicides
than species that live in mineral soil layers.
<H3>Crop Rotation</H3>
<P>
Increasing the diversity of plants in an agroecosystem tends to
prevent the build up of crop-specific pests above economically
damaging threshold levels.  Diversity within a single field can
be created by growing crop mixtures (polycultures or intercrops),
or by tolerating some weed growth.  Diversity over time is created
by growing different crops in succession following a regular sequence
(crop rotations). Crop mixtures are likely to increase soil animal
diversity.<BR>
<P>
Each plant species influences the soil ecosystem in unique ways,
through the type and amount of organic matter released by roots,
the type and amount of litter contributed to the soil, growth
cycles, effects on soil microclimate, and the way it interacts
with beneficial microbes.  These plant influences on soil habitats
do have repercussions on the decomposer community (organisms that
break down organic matter).  Although choice of crop species probably
has less effect on soil organisms than plowing or soil type, rotation
does add to the level of disturbance in soil ecosystems.  In some
cases crop rotation has a greater impact on microarthropods than
insecticide use.<BR>
<P>
Management plans for transitional production systems generally
include legume crops or green manures in a crop rotation as a
way to maintain soil fertility. Legumes as an organic matter and
nitrogen source support larger numbers and greater activity of
soil microbes compared to inorganic nitrogen sources.
<H3>Animal Manures</H3>
<P>
The application of animal manures and composts as nutrient sources
generally increases the abundance and activity of soil plant and
animal life.  Microbial and protozoan activity is highest in organically
fertilized soils.  Manure causes increases of microbial predators,
while decreasing the abundance of plant parasites. Collembolas,
earthworms, and some predatory mites increase in abundance when
manure is added to crop soils, and manure may help to control
nematode populations.
<H3>Strawberry Transition Studies</H3>
<P>
Because of the complexity and interactions of soil processes,
it is important they be examined in concert in studies of farms
and fields making the transition.  The
<P>
UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program, with partial funding from SAREP,
has been studying the transition on a one-third acre site on a
strawberry farm on the north coast of Santa Cruz County since
September 1987 (Gliessman et al., California Agriculture, July-Aug.
1990).  Chandler strawberries were winter-planted in a replicated
randomized block design.  Experimental treatments include conventionally-farmed
strawberry plots with normal inputs, and plots farmed organically
and planted to strawberries during the first year of conversion
and thereafter.  In the experiments, changes in the soil during
transition to organic management practices have been due in large
part to the removal of chemical stress, especially the removal
of fumigation as a preplanting soil treatment.  The addition of
organic matter is also important in determining soil biological
function.  A shift has been observed in the abundance and diversity
of rhizosphere fungi, including those fungi suspected of being
antagonistic towards the pathogenic fungi that are present in
low numbers.  after three years of transition there is no evidence
of fungal disease outbreaks in the organic plots.  Estimates of
microbial biomass have also been higher in the transitional organic
soils.  It is suspected that increasing the diversity and activity
of soil organisms is the key to preventing disease outbreaks in
organically managed systems.<BR>
<P>
The population levels of mycorrhizal fungi have also been monitored,
beneficial organisms that assist the host plant in nutrient and
water uptake.  Mycorrhizal colonization of strawberry roots in
organically managed plots increases during the course of transition,
while fumigation and use of fungicides reduces levels in conventional
plots.  Strawberries left for a second year in this experiment
showed higher levels of colonization at the beginning of the second
production year.<BR>
<P>
In the conventional strawberry production system being studied,
population levels of decomposer invertebrates periodically become
very high, possibly due to the removal of predators by miticide
and insecticide sprays.  In the organically-managed strawberry
production system, population levels tend to stay more consistent
through the year.
<H3>Management Approaches</H3>
<P>
Let's look at some specific problems in the transition to more
sustainable farming practices.<BR>
<P>
If you want to increase nitrogen management efficiency, consider
all sources of nitrogen in your farming system.  If there are
legume cover crops, or if manure or compost are used, consider
them sources of nitrogen.  Look at nitrogen in irrigation water,
and carry-over nitrogen in the soil profile from previous years.
 Some California growers are finding there is sufficient carry-over
nitrogen in the top three to five feet of soil to meet crop nitrogen
needs.<BR>
<P>
A major soil management problem in much of the United States is
herbicide build up.  If herbicides have been used in your farming
system, it is important to consider the possibility of carry-over
problems.  This can be checked by filling a pot with soil from
a field and planting seeds in it.  If the seeds germinate and
grow, there is no problem with that species and the soil.  If
they do not germinate, you may have identified a problem with
that species and a carry-over herbicide.  You will need to find
a crop that will tolerate that herbicide for a short time (one
to three years).<BR>
<P>
Weed control is best achieved with a preventive management approach.
 This can include the use of competitive crops, cover crops, allelopathic
crops (plants that release toxins which suppress weeds), rotations,
good cultivation and irrigation management, and reduced use of
herbicides.  In a row crop you can band herbicides and potentially
reduce herbicide use by 60 to 70 percent.  This technique combined
with other strategies can reduce herbicide input substantially.
 With perennials, the management of cover crops alone may eliminate
weed competition.
<H3>Soil is Dynamic</H3>
<P>
To summarize, soil management during the period of transition
to more sustainable farming practices means looking at our soil
resource as part of a dynamic system, and managing that resource.
 This approach may require changes in attitude and management.
 Soil is a very complex system, which is still not completely
understood.  We do know that there are both short and long-term
benefits to farms and farmers in soil management techniques that
look at the soil as a dynamic living entity.<BR>

<H1>New Advisory Group Focuses on Labor, Rural Issues<BR>
</H1>
<P>
UC SAREP convened the first meeting of its Economic and Public
Policy Advisory Group in Oakland October 26, 1989. The purpose
of the group is to define a research and education agenda for
economic and public policy issues as they affect the sustainability
of California agriculture, provide a forum for discussion, and
plan research and education programs.<BR>
<P>
The group is made up of University of California and California
State University faculty, extension personnel, UC SAREP technical
and public advisory committee members, and private agricultural
consultants. The first meeting began with the identification of
three areas in which economics and public policy have a significant
impact on sustainability: 1) production practices, 2) labor, and
3) rural/community development. Three subgroups discussed these
topics in greater detail and reconvened to hear presentations
from each work group.<BR>
<P>
Presented here are abbreviated summaries from each of the three
work groups.<BR>
<H3>Production Practices Group</H3>
<P>
Participants in this group included <B>Leslie &quot;Bees&quot;
Butler</B>, UC Davis extension agricultural marketing economist;<B>
Bob Cantisano, Fran DuBois, Bruce Jennings, Jack Pandol, Jr. </B>and
<B>Steve Pavich</B>, UC SAREP Public Advisory Committee members;
<B>Bill Liebhardt</B>, UC SAREP director; and <B>Rex Woods</B>
of the university-wide Water Resources Center based at UC Riverside.
<BR>
<P>
The group began by identifying guiding principles for production
practices research. They concluded that this research should 1)
focus on preventive practices vs. &quot;curative ones&quot;; 2)
be more systems-oriented with a long-term focus; 3) be ecologically
sound; and 4) include a focus on the way systems interact. The
group suggested specific areas for research including soil building,
weed control, pests/pathogens, breeding, non-tillage/minimum tillage,
mechanical aids, biological controls, biotechnology, human and
animal nutrition using alternative practices, composting and water
use/quality. Members agreed that the next step is to identify
economic and public policy research related to these practices.
<BR>
<H3>Labor Group</H3>
<P>
Participants in the labor group included<B> Franz Kegel</B>, San
Joaquin County farm advisor; <B>Robert Peyton</B>, UC Division
of Agriculture and Natural Resources analyst; <B>Howard Rosenberg</B>,
UC Berkeley Agricultural Personnel Management  Program  extension
 specialist; <B> Kay</B>
<P>
<B>Thomley</B>, UC SAREP Public Advisory Committee member; <B>Suzanne
Vaupel</B>, agricultural consultant; <B>Don Villarejo</B>, Institute
for Rural Studies executive director; and <B>Jill Auburn</B> and
<B>Gail Feenstra</B> of UC SAREP.<BR>
<P>
The group began by defining sustainable agriculture as &quot;economically
viable, ecologically sound, socially just and humane.&quot; Group
members agreed to direct the attention of SAREP and the university
to the needs of California's agricultural laborers. The group
noted that agricultural labor conditions should meet accepted
social standards for workers in other types of employment, and
suggested new community education and research areas that would
improve social and work conditions for agricultural laborers.
These include: 1) research and education to achieve stable, year-round
employment at a liveable wage; 2) improvement of the availability
and affordability of housing; 3) improvement of information dissemination
to workers and employers regarding worker rights, pesticide and
workplace safety; and 4) the establishment of baseline data to
determine residential conditions, and needs for community services.
<BR>
<P>
The labor group's statement also included questions about how
labor should interact with sustainable production systems, including:
How much labor will be required? When and where is it needed?
What mix of skills will be required? and, What are the preferences
of the people who do and could supply this needed labor? Finally,
the group noted that people involved in farm labor should have
a voice in the political processes affecting them, as well as
in setting priorities for agricultural research.<BR>
<H3>Rural Community Development</H3>
<P>
Participants in this group included <B>Isao Fujimoto</B>, UC Davis
Department of Applied Behavioral Sciences rural communities researcher;
<B>Stan Dundon, Tom Haller, Debra Jones</B>, and <B>George Work</B>,
UC SAREP Public Advisory Committee members; <B>Desmond Jolly</B>,
UC Davis agricultural economist, <B>Lynne Kennedy</B>, UC Agricultural
Issues Center;<B> Jerry Moles</B>, agricultural consultant; <B>Ron
Voss</B>, UC SAREP Technical Advisory Committee member; and <B>Barbara
Wetzel</B>, UC SAREP.<BR>
<P>
The group began by looking at ways in which the University of
California could assist rural residents and communities in achieving
sustainability. They concluded that the most effective way of
doing this may be to become involved in &quot;action-oriented&quot;
research which enables communities to form their own institutions
and policies.<BR>
<P>
Group members noted that rural community problems involve the
economic and environmental deterioration of the land and its residents,
characterized by a flow of resources away from the communities.
This results in a loss of population and human resources.  Research
programs to address these problems must be defined by the communities
themselves, group members concluded. Generally, the goal of these
research programs is the attainment and preservation of a permanent
quality of life which is high enough to cause people to stay in
the community, and desirable enough to attract others to reside
there. Criteria include permanent and equitable access to social,
intellectual, economic and spiritual resources; harmonious interaction
with the environment; use of renewable energy; and the use of
democratic planning and decision-making processes.<BR>
<P>
Group members noted that each community is unique and will define
its own sustainable quality of life differently, and research
conducted by outside groups will need to be somewhat non-traditional.
The work group noted that action research is what rural communities
need now, rather than traditional, publishable research aimed
at peers. The group emphasized that action research has concrete
change as its goal. This change is characterized by a long-term
connection between the community and the assisting agency.  The
assisting agency might be a more typical research group <I>or
</I>a teaching program, that would place students in observational
relationships with communities, farmers and rural residents. An
example of a research topic might be how new ethnic groups can
be sustainably blended into rural communities.<BR>
<P>
The rural communities group ended its discussion by noting that
the current university system presents difficulties for researchers
doing action research because of strict publishing requirements,
lack of acceptance of this less common research by colleagues,
and the inadequacy of community-building inherent in the present
methods of doing research.<BR>
<P>
The UC SAREP Economic and Public Policy Advisory Group will meet
January 11 in Santa Cruz.<BR>

<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Variation among stains in the number of days to flowering may be as much as 60 days (Murphy et al., 1976).  Smith and Roquette, Jr. (1988) indicated that days to flowering vary among cultivars as follows: 'Nungarin' - 77, 'Northam' -'78, 'Dwalganup' - 83, 'Geraldton' - 97, 'Daliak' - 97, 'Dalkeith' - 98, 'Uniwager'- 103, 'Yarloop' - 109, 'Seaton Park' - 110, 'Trikkala' - 112, 'Dinninup' - 113, 'Enfield' - 118, 'Esperance' - 120, 'Junee' - 128, 'Green Range' - 128, 'Clare - 129, 'Woogenellup' - 130, 'Howard' - 93-135, 'Bacchus Marsh' - 131, 'Karridale' - 136, 'Mt. Barker' - 137, 'Larisa' - 142, 'Nangeela' - 143, 'Meteora' - 148, and 'Tallarook' - 163.<P> Starting times for flowering periods were related by Murphy et al. (1976) as follows: early-season (late Jan. - early Feb.) cultivars are  'Geraldton', 'Dwalganup', 'Daliak;' early-midseason (mid-Feb.- March) are 'Seaton Park', 'Yarloop', 'Dinninup;' mid-season (March and April) are 'Woogenellup', 'Howard', 'Clare', 'Bacchus March', 'Mt.  Barker', 'Nangella;' and late-season (late April and May) is 'Tallarook'.<P> Cv 'Green Range' flowers and matures in early mid season, about the same time as cv 'Woogenellup' (approximately 128 days at Perth with early May sowing), and 6-9 days earlier than cv 'Karridale' (AHPRA, 1985).<P> 'Junee' flowers in early midseason, about a week earlier than cv. 'Woogenellup' in inland and southern Western Australia.  At Perth it flowers about the same time as 'Woogenellup' (about 128 days with early May sowing, which would correspond to early November sowing in the northern hemisphere) (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Karridale' shows mid-season flowering, about the same time as cv. 'Mt. Barker' and 6-9 days after cvv.  'Green Range' and 'Woogenellup.' At Perth (Australia), flowering occurs about 136 days after early May sowing (AHPRA, 1985).<P> Cv 'Trikkala' typically flowers slightly later than cv 'Yarloop' or about 118 days after germination in Western Australia (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Cv 'Koala' has been termed a midseason-flowering variety (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>

<DD>There is dispute over the taxonomic status of subterranean clovers; some systematists have said that three species are comprised, and that subterranean and subclover are common names applied to three clover species: <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L. ,<I> T. yanninicum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley and <I>T. brachycalycinum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988).  Others have written that there are three subspecies of <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L>, as noted: <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L. spp.  <I>subterraneum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley, <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> spp.  <I>yanninicum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley.  (Mackay and Barnard, 1981), and <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> spp. <I>yanninicum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley (Mackay and Barnard, 1981),  and <I>Trifolium  subterraneum</I></B>  spp. <I>brachycalycinum</I></B> Katznelson and Morley (Duke, 1981.). <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L.  spp. <I>subterraneum</I></B> comprises the cultivars 'Enfield' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981), Green Range' (AHPRA, 1985), 'Junee' (AHPRA, 1985), 'Karridale' (AHPRA, 1985). <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> spp.  <I>yanninicum</I></B> includes 'Meteora' and 'Trikkala' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> spp. <I>brachycalycinum</I></B> includes 'Clare' and 'Koala' (Hill et al., 1991; Graves, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described subterranean clover as a decumbent, large-seeded winter annual legume, more or less softly pubescent with stems slender, procumbent to decumbent, 0.5-4.0 (rarely to 8) dm long, forming circular clumps; leaves are all long-petioled; leaflets broadly obcordate, entire except for the shallowly crenate apex; stipules ovate to oblong-ovate, the lowermost acuminate, otherwise acute to obtuse; peduncles axillary, reflexing, elongating, and burying the heads in the soil after anthesis; inflorescence a few-flowered fascicle becoming a globose head in fruit; fertile flowers 2-5, whitish, striped with rose, 12-14 m long; sterile flowers developing after anthesis, numerous, apetalous, finally completely enclosing the pods; calyx of fertile flowers nerveless, the tube glabrous, the subequal flexous teeth ciliate, equalling the tube, at first setaceous, becoming stout; corolla about twice the length of the calyx; sterile flowers with calyx-teeth rather unequal, narrow, irregularly bent, slightly exserted, 1-seeded.  McGuire (1985) mentioned that stems and runners of subterranean clover are prostrate and do not develop adventitious roots.<P> Smith and Roquette (1988) also stated that subclover has prostrate, non-rooting stems; the inconspicuous flowers are white or white with pink veins and arise from leaf axils.  After self-fertilization, the flower stem (peduncle) bends toward the ground as a burr develops around the seed pods.<P> Subterranean clover is self-fertile and cleistogamous (McGuire, 1985).<P> Various cultivars have morphological and other characteristics, as recounted by various authors (Editor's note).<P> In cv 'Bacchus March' most burs are produced above ground (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) wrote that cv 'Enfield' has hairy stems that are reddish brown when exposed to sunlight.  The petioles are relatively short, hairy and reddish brown when exposed.  The leaves are dark green and moderately hairy with more hairs on the lower surface than on the upper.  The first leaves have a light green crescent and, if conditions are cold, the rest of the leaf, above and below the crescent, can be heavily pigmented with anthocyanin. As the plant develops to the rosette stage the color fades, leaving a few purple flecks and the light green, arrowhead-shaped crescent which usually does not extend to the edge of the leaflet.  The stipules are highly pigmented, if exposed, but in a dense sward only the veins are red.  The calyx tube is green but the lobes have some anthocyanin.  The flowers are white with purple veins in the standard.  In a sward, the flowers develop close to the ground and are therefore much less visible from above than in other varieties.<P> Murphy et al. (1976) described cv 'Geraldton' as having leaves sparse, long runners, and as being an abundant seed producer, and a winter producer.<P> According to (AHPRA, 1985), cv 'Green Range' has slightly indented leaflets together with prominent leaflet crescent markings inherited from it Nangeela grandparent.  The crescent is angular and comprises a yellow-green central area, rising to a point close to the leaflet margin, with strong white arms on either side descending to the base of the leaflet.  In winter or under some other conditions restricting growth, coarse purplish-red flecking is variably prominent, especially just above and below the crescent, together occasionally with purplish-brown pigmentation outlining the crescent or forming a partial bar along the midrib below the crescent.  The stipules have strong, bright purplish-red pigmentation over much of their surface, especially towards the base of runners.  Leaflet upper surfaces sparsely to moderately hairy.  Petioles and stems sparsely to moderately hairy, peduncles moderately hairy; all with weak to moderate purplish-brown pigmentation where exposed to the sun.  Calyx green apart from occasional light purplish-brown pigmentation of the teeth.  Corolla is white with fine pink veins.<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) described cv 'Junee' as having a broad- triangular, moderately indented leaflet and leaflet crescent marking similar to that of cv 'Tallarook', derived from that cultivar via cv 'Howard.' The crescent has only slight curvature and, in early leaves, consists of a small central light green area with variable and sometimes faint whitish arms at either side. Late in the growing season, often only the white arms are visible. In winter and under certain other conditions conducive to slow growth, there is usually some purple-red flecking in the vicinity of the leaflet midrib and occasional flecks elsewhere, together with brownish purple flushing mainly of the area below the crescent.  Stipule and calyx light green.  Corolla is white with pinkish red veins.  Leaflet upper surfaces sparsely to moderately appressed-hairy.  Petioles and stems sparsely hairy and peduncles more or less hairless.  Stems relatively slender, with slight to moderate purplish brown pigmentation where exposed to the sun.  In the reproductive phase, 'Junee' can be distinguished from cv. Howard, despite similar leaf and calyx markings, by the lesser hairiness of its leaves, petioles, stems, and especially peduncles, which are nearly glabrous as opposed to the densely hairy peduncles of 'Howard.'<P> According to AHPRA (1985), cv 'Karridale' has rounded leaflets and prominent, rounded leaflet crescent markings inherited from its 'Nangeela' grandparent.  The crescent comprises a yellow-green central area with strong white arms on either side, curving towards the vase of the leaflet.  In winter or under some other conditions restricting growth, coarse purplish red flecking is variably prominent, especially just above and below the crescent, together occasionally with purplish brown pigmentation outlining the crescent.  Stipule veins purplish red, usually with a moderately prominent transverse bar of the same color.  Leaflet upper surfaces more or less hairless.  Petioles sparsely hairy, stems moderately hairy, peduncles moderately appressed-hairy: all robust, with moderate brownish purple pigmentation where exposed to the sun. Calyx green apart from occasional light purplish brown pigmentation of the teeth.  Corolla white with fine pink veins.<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) termed cv 'Meteora' a typical member of subspecies <I>yanninicum</I></B> and wrote that it was almost glabrous, possessing long petioles.  Leaflets are large and bright green on long petioles.  Leaflet markings are distinct from the other <I>yanninicum </I></B> cvv 'Yarloop' and 'Trikkala'.  The leaflet crescent is conspicuous and yellow green, reaching the margin of the leaflet in mature leaves.  There are no crescent arms or conspicuous leaf flecks.  Stipules are green with red veins and a red flush between the veins under cool conditions.  Calyx tube is green, glabrous, corolla white.  Pods large, leathery and enclosed in the large transversely wrinkled calyx.  In the burr, 2-3 pods protrude from the sparsely distributed sterile calyxs.<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) described cv 'Trikkala' as a typical member of subspecies <I>yanninicum</I></B>, being almost glabrous with long petioles.  Leaf, flower, and stipule characteristics as for cv.  Larisa.<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), subterranean clover tolerates soil pH of 4.5-8.2, with the mean of 31 cases being 6.1.  Haby (1988) maintained that subterranean clovers do not tolerate pH 5.1, and soils which have a pH below 5.5 should be limed to 6.0 or above. In general, the species is best adapted to acid or moderately acid to neutral soils (Murphy et al., 1976; Finch & Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986; Munoz & Graves, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988; Miller et al., 1989).  <I>T.  subterraneum</I></B>, including the cultivars 'Mt.  Barker,' 'Woogenellup,' and 'Tallarook,' are well adapted to and highly productive on sandy, acid soils, where the newer varieties 'Esperance', 'Larisa', and 'Meteora' also show promise. <I>T.  brachycalycinum</I></B>, including cvv 'Clare' and 'Koala', predominates on neutral and more alkaline soils (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988).  Indeed, those two cvv are the most productive cultivars of subterranean clover where soil pH exceeds 7.2 (Bade et al., 1988; Evers, 1988; Reed et al., 1989), with 'Mt. Barker' and 'Karridale' faring well at lower pH (Bade et al., 1988).  Most varieties of subterranean clover can stand moderately acid soil (McGuire, 1985).<P> Subterranean clover varieties 'Koala,' 'Meteora,' and 'Clare' yielded the most on a calcareous site, and 'Trikkala,' 'Larisa,' and 'Koala' yielded particularly well on an acid site.  In general, 'Koala' has performed particularly well on alkaline soils (Gildersleeve et al., 1988).<P> As recounted by Richardson et al. (1988), nodulation of subterranean clover is reduced at solutions of pH lower than 5.0, and eliminated below 4.5.  Low numbers of rhizobia were present. Nodulation is also sensitive to Al concentrations of 10 micromoles or greater.  These restrictions can be somewhat reduced by the addition of Ca and P.  To ensure proper nodulation of subterranean clover throughout the rooting profile, lime should be incorporated, rather than merely placed on the soil surface.  Plants compensate for low pH by nodulating more in the less-acidic portions of the soil profile.  Inoculation and calcium coating of seeds did not alleviate poor nodulation in the acidic zones.<P> Evans et al.  (1988) found that nodulation of 'Woogenellup' subterranean clover is reduced when soil pH is below a threshold level of about 5.0.  Liming improves this situation.  Although rhizobia may ultimately attain the same densities in acid as in limed soils, their accumulation is not as rapid in the former during autumn and winter.<P> Gildersleeve et al.  (1988) wrote that iron deficiency is often most pronounced on soils with high pH.  On sites with calcareous soils and high pH, susceptible species exhibit symptoms of iron deficiency chlorosis when grown on high pH, high base status soils containing free calcium carbonate.  'Clare' and 'Koala' are the only Australian varieties available suggested for calcareous soils. Both performed well in field and greenhouse trails in Texas.  'Mt. Barker' and 'Woogenellup' have shown iron deficiency symptoms (chlorosis).  By contrast 'Koala' and 'Clare' have shown no chlorosis, and 'Larisa' and 'Trikkala' showed only slight chlorosis.<P> When paired with either 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak' subterranean clovers in a 3-year field replacement-series study, the cultivar 'Clare' (<I>Trifolium brachycalycinum</I></B>) dominated the mixed stands.  Soil pH was 5.4-5.5; mowing was once every 4 weeks. Petiolar length of 'Clare' is much greater than the early-maturing 'Daliak,' and slightly greater than the mid-season maturing 'Seaton Park.' Under stress, 'Clare' also showed better seedling vigor and survival and greater seed production per plant.  Dry matter production by 'Clare' also is less dependent on plant density. There was evidence of overyielding by mixtures of 'Clare' and 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' seed reserves appeared to be more greatly reduced over the summer months than were those of 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak.'<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Because cultivars of the three species of subterranean clover vary in their tolerances, soil conditions do not usually restrict production as temperature and rainfall do (McGuire, 1985).  Duke (1981) wrote that subterranean clover does especially well on light soils, although it tolerates heavy soils, and that the species grows well and reseeds on all well-drained soils that can sustain white clover.  Munoz & Graves (1988) wrote that the species tolerates loam to clay soils.  McLeod (1982) stated that growth is best in well drained, loam soils and that the species does well on hilly land.  However, varieties of <I>T. yanninicum</I></B> (e.g., 'Meteora', 'Trikkala', and 'Yarloop') do well on waterlogged soils (McGuire, 1985), on which this species is widely distributed (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988).<P> Bade et al.  (1988) mentioned that subterranean clover performs very well on clay pan soils so long as pH is below 7.3.  Sub clover is adapted to most of the fine sandy loam and clay upland soils in Southeast Texas.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover can be sown in prepared seed beds at a depth of about 1 cm; it can also be seeded aerially (McGuire, 1985).<P> If feasible, plant seed into the soil as opposed to surface sowing in order to extend the survival of the rhizobia bacteria (Weaver, 1988).<P> Evers (1988) reported that broadcasting the seeds resulted in the highest yields.  Drilling in narrow rows gave better yields that did drilling in wide rows.  Broadcasting the seed delayed competition between clover seedlings for light and moisture and produced a solid canopy of subclover quicker.  Drilling the seed in rows resulted in early competition between clover seedlings within the row and delayed forming a solid canopy within until the plants were big enough to cover the area between the rows.<P> Seedbed should be smooth, firm, and free of clods.  Covering the seeds with soil protects inoculant on the seed, and improves water retention.  Rolling is recommended, especially on clay or loam soils (Evers, 1988).<P> The small grain seed box on a regular grain drill will work for subclover if high seeding rates (about 15 lbs/acre or higher) are used.  Lower rates can be used if the clover is mixed with ryegrass (Evers, 1988).<P> Subterranean clover should be seeded in mixes at heavier (than medics) rates (8 to 15 lbs/acre) in the early fall before the first rains (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Subterranean clover should be seeded onto a firm seedbed in the fall (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>'Mt.  Barker' has been the most available variety (Bade et al., 1988), and some cultivars are hard to find, with new cultivars replacing old ones (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Most of the subclover seed is produced in Australia, but there is a small amount of seed of 'Mt.  Barker' produced in Oregon; it is best to order seed at least one month before the desired planting date (Evers, 1988).<P> Most major agricultural seed retailers in California sell subterranean clover; readily available cultivars include 'Dalkeith', 'Koala', 'Mt. Barker', 'Seaton Park', and 'Trikkala' (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Recommended planting dates are in the early fall (Lanini, pers. comm.; Munoz & Graves, 1988); or simply in the fall (McLeod, 1982; Finch & Sharp, 1983; Miller, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> According to Evers (1988), good germination of subclover does not occur until the daily low temperature reaches the mid-60's.  An early planting date maximizes fall forage production before winter but also increases the risk of losing the clover stand to fall drought.  Delaying the planting date for cooler temperatures increase the amount of time for germination and seedling establishment and reduces the amount of fall forage production. However, there is less risk of drought.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates have been variously recommended as 9-13 kg/ha or 20 kg/ha aerial seeding (McGuire, 1985), 10-20 lb/acre (Hofstetter, 1988), 12 lb/acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983), 12-20 lbs/acre of raw seed (Graves et al., 1986), 15 lb/acre (Miller, 1988), 15-30 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988), 22-28 kg/ha (broadcast) (Duke, 1981), 20 to 30 lbs/acre (McLeod, 1982; Miller et al., 1989), and 20-30 lb per acre (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> Evers (1988) suggested a general seeding rate of 10 to 16 lbs/acre.  Increasing the seeding rate increases the amount of early forage production and a solid cover is formed earlier.  The seeding rate needed for a satisfactory subclover stand increases as the seedbed becomes rougher and/or the weed and grass competition becomes more severe.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover can be sown in prepared seed beds at a depth of about 1 cm; it can also be seeded aerially (McGuire, 1985).<P> Evers (1988) suggested that the best stands occur when seeds are placed in the top on-half inch of soil.  If planting in a well drained sandy soil, drilling the seed in narrow rows about 3/4-inch deep may be more desirable.  1/4 to 1/2 inches was recommended by Peaceful Valley (1988), and 1/2 inch by McLeod (1982).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>A combination of P and K can increase subclover production (Haby, 1988).  McGuire (1985) wrote that superphosphate has been the most important fertilizer used on rangeland to support subterranean clover and that sulfur and molybdenum can also be limiting.  McLeod (1982) emphasized the importance of phosphate fertilization.   Peaceful Valley's (1988) account said that subterranean clovers thrive with low soil fertility, but growth and nitrogen fixation are greater on soils supplemented with phosphorus, calcium, and sulfur.<P> Haby (1988) wrote that 40 or more lbs S/acre increased yields 45 % over treatments receiving only phosphorus.  Clover growing on deeper sandy soils should be more responsive to S applications. Micronutrient requirements in acid soils are thought to include molybdenum, boron, and in heavily limed soils, possibly zinc. Copper increased subclover yields in Australia.<P> In a growth chamber study by Guerrero and Williams (1975), Filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I></B>) and subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> cv 'Woogenellup') were grown in sole and mixed cultures in a phosphorus-deficient range soil (from Butte County) and in sand with differing levels of supplemental nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.  Filaree dominated if phosphorus was limiting, whereas subterranean clover did so if nitrogen were left out of the fertilizer.  Subterranean clover has a higher requirement for phosphorus than does filaree and also appears less capable of exploiting insoluble phosphatic sources.  Addition of superphosphate to rangeland soils is suggested as a means of promoting subterranean clover.<P> Shock et al.  (1984) added the equivalent of 0, 10, and 80 kg of S per ha were added to lysimeters containing monocultures and bicultures, of subterranean clover, soft chess, and filaree.  The equivalent of 100 kg of N per ha was also added as ammonium chloride.  Addition of sulfur improved uptake of fertilizer nitrogen by subterranean clover and soft chess monocultures and in subterranean clover + soft chess and subterranean clover + filaree bicultures.  Addition of sulfur fertilizer increased the percentage of N derived from fixation by subterranean clover.<P> As recounted by Barrow and Mendoza (1990), sigmoid yield responses to increasing levels of a nutrient (e.g., P) suggest that there is a lower threshold concentration below which plants cannot take up the nutrient, and diminishing returns to further addition of the nutrient above an upper threshold.  Those scientists conducted trials with freshly-applied vs. incubated phosphate using a yellowish brown loamy sand (pH 5.6), and found markedly sigmoid response curves for subterranean clover (cv 'Yarloop') and narrow-leafed lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B>), but not for <I>L. cosentinii</I></B> or <I>L.  luteus</I></B>.  The results suggest that the lupins (especially <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B>) grew better than subterranean clover at low phosphorus concentration.  At low levels of phosphate application, roots of subterranean clover were heavily infected with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae; infection but no arbuscules were detected with the lupins.  Previous studies had suggested that responses of subterranean clover to added phosphorus are not sigmoid in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi.  Findings of the present study were contrary to this.<P> Based on pot experiments and literature review, burr medic and barrel medic are not as efficient at absorbing P as is subterranean clover.  Yellow serradella is more efficient at absorbing P from soil than either subterranean clover or burr medic (Paynter, 1990).<P> Iron deficiency is often most pronounced on soils with high pH. On sites with calcareous soils and high pH, 'Mt.  Barker' and 'Woogenellup' have shown iron deficiency symptoms (chlorosis).  By contrast 'Koala' and 'Clare' have shown no chlorosis, and 'Larisa' and 'Trikkala' showed only slight chlorosis (Gildersleeve et al., 1988).<P> In Californian rangeland dynamics, high soil nitrogen leads to dominance by nonlegumes, whereas legumes dominate when phosphorus and sulfur are elevated (Shock et al., 1984).  Evers (1988) confirmed that grass and weeds can retard subclover stands if high rates of nitrogen are used.  When nitrogen fertilizer was applied to a subclover-ryegrass mixture there was no decrease in nodulation at up to 50 lbs/acre.  Subclover alone showed decreased nodulation at the lowest rate (25 lbs/acre).<P> Apply P (and K if required) fertilizer in the fall just before expected clover germination.  Avoid N fertilizer in the fall when attempting to establish or re-establish clover (Ocumpaugh, 1988).<P> Clover forage production averaged 37% less when 100 lbs N/acre were applied to bermuda grass and bahiagrass the previous summer. Subclover growth, reseeding, and persistence are improved if nitrogen fertilizer is not applied the previous summer (Evers and Smith, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Fifteen cultivars of subterranean clover and one of balansa clover were grown in conjunction with perennial ryegrass and evaluated for tolerance to four herbicides applied separately and in some two-way combinations: 2,4-DB, MCPA-Na salt, MCPA amine, and bromoxynil, 2,4-DB + bromoxynil, MCPA-Na salt + bromoxynil, MCPA amine + bromoxynil.  The subterranean clovers evaluated were 'Clare,' 'Nuba,' 'Larisa,' 'Meteora,' 'Trikkala,' 'Dalkeith,' 'Enfield,' 'Esperance,' 'Green Range,' 'Junee,' 'Karridale,' 'Mt. Barker,' 'Nungarin,' 'Seaton Park,' and 'Woogenellup.' The sole representative of <I>Trifolium balansae</I></B> was cv 'Paradana.' Based on visual assessment, 2,4-DB was the most damaging herbicide and bromoxynil the least.  'Trikkala' (<I>Trifolium subterraneum ssp. yanninicum</I></B>) showed particularly good tolerance of herbicides. Within  the subspecies <I>brachycalycinum</I></B>, 'Clare' showed much better tolerance than did 'Nuba' (Evans et al., 1989).<P> Griffin and Dabney (1990) reported that subterranean clover was controlled by paraquat at 1.1 kg ai/ha (80% control when applied in early April; 100% control in early May).  Glyphosate and SC-0224 applied in April gave 53% control.  HOE-39866 applied in April gave excellent control of subterranean clover.<P> Subterranean clover is tolerant of Paraquat, 2,4-DB, and Poast (Lanini, pers. comm.) and is more resistant to glyphosate than most other cover crops (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Ocumpaugh (1988) recommended avoiding both herbicides toxic to clover and "brush control" herbicides such as picloram, unless these can be applied as a spot treatment or with a carpet roller. Such herbicides have enough residual effect to prevent clover establishment for a year or more.  Subclover will tolerate low rates of 2,4-D, but weeds will not be controlled unless the herbicide is applied when the weeds are small.<P> On neutral and alkaline soils, competition by burclover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Burclover is very sensitive to 2,4-D herbicide and can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Bugg et al. (1991a) conducted a field trial in southern Georgia concerning 20 cover-cropping regimes and associated insects. Convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville]) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) first were found in substantial numbers on rye, then on crimson clover and lentil, later on subterranean clover (which harbored pea aphid [<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> {Harris}]), still later on narrow-leafed lupin, then hairy vetch, and lastly on mustard and collard.  Bigeyed bugs, mainly <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say), were abundant from late March through late April on 'Vantage' vetch, lentil, and in monocultures of hairy vetch and crimson clover.  Berseem and arrowleaf clovers, hairy vetch/ryegrass, and 'Mt. Baker' subterranean clover remained green later than did many other crops and exhibited exceptionally-high densities of bigeyed bugs on June 2nd. <I>Lygus</I></B> spp., which are important pests of field, row, and orchard crops, were exceptionally abundant on 'Cahaba White' and 'Vantage' vetches.  Both feature stipular extrafloral nectaries at which <I>Lygus</I></B> frequently fed.  <I>Lygus</I></B> were also abundant on hairy vetch (monoculture and biculture), and to a lesser extent on turnip and monocultural crimson clover.  <I>Lygus</I></B> were notably scarce on subterranean clover, which lacks floral and extrafloral nectar, and the developing seeds of which are below ground and inaccessible.<P> Field trials by Bugg et al. (1990b) in southern Georgia indicated that during April and early May, <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) (tarnished plant bug) attained relatively-high densities on the hybrid vetch (cv 'Cahaba White' or 'Vantage'), lower levels on crimson clover and lentil, and particularly-low densities on 'Mt.  Barker' subterranean clover.  Low densities were also obtained on 10 other varieties of subterranean clover.  Late-instar and adult tarnished plant bug lived longer when caged on crimson clover than on hybrid vetch, which in turn supported better survival than did subterranean clover.  When adult tarnished plant bug were caged on hybrid vetch or subterranean clover with or without floral and fruiting structures, there was no evidence that the presence of these structures prolonged tarnished plant bug survival on either crop.  In laboratory choice tests with flowering and fruiting sprigs of three cover crops, tarnished plant bug preferred crimson clover over hybrid vetch, which in turn was more attractive than subterranean clover.  When sprigs were presented after reproductive structures had been excised, there was no statistically-significant preference by tarnished plant bug. Subterranean clovers appear to provide both a less-attractive and less-favorable habitat for <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) than either crimson clover or the hybrid vetches. Preferred use of subterranean clovers in rotation or as interplants might reduce tarnished plant bug in agroecosystems.<P> In southern Georgia, Bugg et al.  (1991a) investigated the use of dying mulches" of cool-season cover crops to enhance biological control of insect pests on succeeding spring plantings of cantaloupe (<I>Cucumis melo</I></B> L. var.  <I>reticulatus</I></B> Seringe). Eight cover-crop regimes were tested in a replicated trial: (1) A hybrid vetch, <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.  X <I>V. cordata</I></B> Wulf (Fabaceae, cv 'Vantage'); (2) Common lentil, <I>Lens culinaris</I></B> L.  (Fabaceae, cv 'Chilean 78'); (3) Subterranean clover, <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L.  (Fabaceae, cv 'Mt.  Barker'); (4) Crimson clover, <I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L.  (Fabaceae, cv 'Dixie'); (5) Rye, <I>Secale cereale</I></B> L. (Poaceae, cv 'Wrens Abruzzi') ; (6) Mustard, <I>Brassica hirta</I></B> Moench (Brassicaceae, cv 'Florida Broadleaf'); (7) Polyculture of the six crops just mentioned; and (8) Control, which received no seeds, but was otherwise treated similarly to other regimes.  Significant differences due to cover crop were obtained for densities of the generalist predator <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) amid cover crops, their residues, or weeds; on or near cantaloupe plants; and on or near sentinel egg masses of fall armyworm, <I>Spodoptera furgiperda</I></B> (J.  E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) pinned to cantaloupe leaves.  No significant effect due to cover crop was found for proportions of of egg masses occupied or damaged by predators.  In all four cases, absolute responses were highest for the plots of subterranean clover.  Among those regimes attaining good stands of cover crops, numbers of <I>G. punctipes</I></B> per sentinel egg mass were significantly greater for the subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, polyculture, but not than 'Vantage' vetch.  Rye was particularly poor habitat for <I>G. punctipes</I></B>.<P> Subterranean clover can be subject to heavy damage by insects. (Bade et al., 1988) and is attacked by blue alfalfa aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B>) and by various mites (McGuire, 1985). Cv 'Green Range' shows some tolerance of blue-green aphids (<I>Acyrthosiphon kondoi</I></B> Shinji) (AHPRA, 1985).  Cv 'Junee' is moderately susceptible (Mackay and Barnard, 1981), and cv 'Karridale' is only moderately tolerant but shows above-average resistance to redlegged earth mites, <I>Halotydeus destructor</I></B> (Tuck) (AHPRA, 1985).<P> In greenhouse tests, 'Enfield' was tolerant to spotted alfalfa aphid, semi- tolerant to the blue green aphid and very susceptible to pea aphid (AHPRA, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described the species as a more or less softly pubescent annual legume, with stems slender and procumbent to decumbent.  Miller et al.  (1989) and Finch & Sharp (1983) termed it a prostrate plant that buries its seed pod after flowering. Mackay and Barnard, (1981) described it as semi-prostrate.<P> It has also been called indeterminate (Bugg et al., 1989), but indeterminacy is better expressed in later-maturing cultivars.<P> Different cultivars show differing habits and statures.  'Enfield' is prostrate (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Green Range': is moderately robust (AHPRA, 1985).  'Junee' is prostrate in the early stages, but it changes to semi-erect after flowering (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Karridale' grows vigorously, appearing semi-prostrate early but becoming erect after flowering (AHPRA, 1985).  'Meteora' shows an erect, tall growth habit (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>The subterranean clovers include numerous cultivars (Finch & Sharp, 1983) with varying flowering and maturation dates and low-temperature requirements for reproduction (McGuire, 1985). Cultivars also vary greatly as to soil pH and moisture optima and tolerances, heights, biomass production, proportion of hard seed, and concentrations of estrogenic compounds (R.L. Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Many varieties of subterranean clover were produced in Australia (McLeod, 1982; McGuire, 1985).  Collectively, strains are adapted over a wide range of rainfall zones and soils (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Subterrranean clover may grow to a height of 6 to 8 inches. (Graves et al., 1986; Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P> In southern Georgia, a study indicated that subterranean clover varieties attained maximum heights as noted (cm, Mean+/-SEM, where cultivar was replicated): 'Enfield': 23.63; 'Esperance': 15.00; 'Howard': 22.75; 'Junee': 18.25; 'Nangeela': 21.75; Talarook': 15.50; "Mississippi Ecotype": 16.00; 'Koala': 34.63+/-1.63; 'Larisa': 24.88+/-0.63; 'Meteora': 23.63+/-0.88; 'Trikkala': 29.75+/-1.25; 'Mt.  Barker': 23.88+/-1.25 (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In a replicated study (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May 2, 1991, heights for the various subterranean clovers were as follows (cm, Mean +/-S.E.M.): 'Koala': 45.72+/-2.93, 'Dalkeith': 31.75+/-1.27, 'Trikkala': 43.82+/-1.60, 'Mt. Barker': 36.83+/-2.64, and 'Seaton Park': 37.47+/-2.40 (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Subterranean clovers do not produce much biomass, according to Graves et al.  (1986) and (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P> Mean dry wt. of subclover in a three-year field trial in Georgia was 4.00 Mg/ha (Hargrove, 1986).<P> Dry matter yields (Mg/ha) obtained in individual studies of subterranean clover were given as: 3.8, 6.0, 4.0 (Smith et al., 1987).<P> In southern Georgia, a study during 1988-89 indicated that subterranean clover varieties drilled into prepared seedbeds attained the following estimated above-ground dry-weight phytomass values (Mg/ha, mean +/- SEM where replicated): 'Meteora': 5.934+/-0.631; 'Larisa': 6.955+/-2.250; 'Mt. Barker': 11.036+/-1.455; 'Esperance': 4.554; 'Nangeela': 5.590; 'Trikkala': 11.991+/-0.374; 'Junee': 4.948; 'Enfield': 5.171; 'Howard': 9.456; 'Koala': 10.619+/-.081; 'Talarook':7.435; Mississippi Ecoytpe 6.432 (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In prepared seedbeds in Texas, annual biomass yields (dry matter, kg/ha) for subterranean clovers were as follows: 'Mt. Barker': 1,205; 2,969; 3,393; 'Clare': 326; 2,856; 4,118; 'Meteora': 1,497; 2,894; 4,262; 'Karridale': 3,384; 3,280; 'Woogenellup': 2,113; 2,993; 3,567; and 'Koala': 3,799; 4,604 (Bade et al., 1988).<P> In a replicated trial in an organic vineyard in, Hopland, Mendocino County, California, Bugg et al.  (unpublished data) found that dry above-ground biomass measurements were as follows (Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.): 'Koala': 9.663+/-1.605; 'Dalkeith': 5.134+/-1.842; 'Trikkala': 8.281+/-1.371; 'Mt. Barker': 7.628+/-0.988; 'Seaton Park': 6.814+/-0.378 Mg/ha.  When cover crops and weeds were included, the corresponding figures were: 'Koala': 9.750+/-1.595; 'Dalkeith': 7.431+/-1.866; 'Trikkala': 9.890+/-1.427; 'Mt. Barker': 8.209+/-0.851; and 'Seaton Park': 7.765+/-0.487.<P> Subterranean clover on rangelands in Oregon yields 5,000 to 6,000 kg/ha of dry matter (McGuire, 1985).<P> In combination with 'Coastal bermudagrass (a warm-season grass) in Texas, annual dry matter biomass yields (kg/ha) for 'Mt. Barker' subterranean clover were as follows: 3,681; 2,430; and 1,636 kg/ha. In combination with common Bermuda grass (a warm-season grass) in Texas, annual dry matter biomass yields (kg/ha) for a mixture of subterranean clovers were as follows: 407; 937; and 1,349 kg/ha (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>The WR rhizobial strain (Nitragin Co.) (the same strain as for rose clover) is appropriate for subterranean clover (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981; Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> Information on rhizobial requirements is limited.  Nodulation and growth on a new site with strains WU95 and CC2480a was good.  TA1 was slightly inferior (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> In field tests rhizobial strains differed in ability to compete with ineffective native rhizobia and in ability to survive the long summer drought.  In composites, poor or moderately effective rhizobial strains reduced the effectiveness of the good strains. Subclover growth increased in field experiments as the amount of inoculum was increased, indicating that high rhizobial numbers were important.  Peat inoculum applied with 40% gum arabic solution as a sticker and a lime coating was much superior to peat inoculum applied as a water slurry.  Vacuum-inoculation treatment gave no better results than uninoculated seed.  The effectiveness of inoculation sticker materials fell generally in the following decreasing order: "PELGEL-PELINOC", gum arabic-lime, methyl-cellulose-lime, sugar lime (Jones et al., 1978).<P> Cultivars of subclover differed in responses to strains of rhizobia.  'Woogenellup' was more specific than was 'Mt.  Barker' (Jones et al., 1978).<P> Jones et al.  (1978) reported trials with subterranean clover indicating that that effective rhizobia could be impeded by ineffective native rhizobia.  To be effective, rhizobia must be able to survive the long summer drought.  Therefore, 2-year studies that include reseeding stands are needed.  Cultivar 'Woogonellup' performed best when inoculated with rhizobial strain X-47 and was more specific in rhizobial affinity than was 'Mt.  Barker'.  In 2nd-year stands, 'Woogonellup' did best with strain X16; 'Mt. Barker performed adequately with strains X16 and X20.  Peat-based inoculum was superior to other forms.  Effectiveness of glues in descending order was "PelGel-Pellinoc" > gum arabic-lime > methylcellulose-lime > sugar-lime.<P> Evans et al.  (1988) stated that nodulation of 'Woogenellup' subterranean clover is reduced when soil pH is below a threshold level of about 5.0.  Liming improves this situation.  Although rhizobia may ultimately attain the same densities in acid as in limed soils, their accumulation is not as rapid in the former during autumn and winter.<P> Bade et al.  (1988) wrote that on neutral and alkaline soils, competition by burclover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Burclover is very sensitive to 2,4-D herbicide and can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cost of subclover seed is about $1.25/lb, according to Munoz & Graves (1988).  Slayback (pers. comm.) stated that price varies among cultivars.  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail prices in dollars per lb as indicated for the following cultivars in 1993: 'Nungarin' $1.53, 'Dalkeith' $1.75, 'Trikkala' $1.53, 'Junee $1.87, 'Koala' $1.93, 'Clare' $1.80, and 'Karridale' $1.87.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover has a taproot with many fibrous supporting roots; the stems and runners of subterranean clover are prostrate and do not develop adventitious roots (McGuire, 1985).  According to Fred Thomas (pers. comm.), early taproot development by subterranean clover is not as rapid as that of burclover. Therefore, in mixed stands, burclover is favored by a germinating rain in early autumn followed by a drought, whereas continuous moisture from autumn on favors subterranean clover.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Murphy et al.  (1976) recounted that mixtures of several varieties are usually more productive than any single variety alone.  Recommendations (lbs/acre) depend on local conditions and seed availability.  <P>

 Murphy et al.(1976) mentioned several replacement options.  Cv 'Clare' can replace part of other midseason varieties ('Woogenellup', 'Howard', 'Seaton Park', or 'Dinninup') on heavy soils with pH of 7.5-9.0.  'Yarloop' subclover can replace midseason varieties on waterlogged soils.  Crimson clover can be substituted for part of the rose clover, especially in grainland rotation.<P> Hill et al.  (1991) found that when paired with either 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak' subterranean clovers in a 3-year field replacement-series study, cv 'Clare' (<I>Trifolium brachycalycinum</I></B>) dominated the mixed stands.  Soil pH was 5.4-5.5, mowing was once every 4 weeks.  Petiolar length of 'Clare' is much greater than the early-maturing 'Daliak,' and slightly greater than the mid-season maturing 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' also showed better seedling vigor and survival and greater seed production per plant, under stress.  Dry matter production by 'Clare' also is less dependent on plant density. There was evidence of overyielding by mixtures of 'Clare' and 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' seed reserves appear to be more greatly reduced over the summer months than were those of 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak.' <I>Trifolium brachycalycinum</I></B> cultivars such as 'Clare' are supposedly suited mainly to neutral to alkaline soils, and are believed less tolerant to close grazing and less able to bury their burrs than is <I>T. subterraneum</I></B>.<P> Williams (1963) sowed Crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L., strain S.  Australian commercial), rose clover (<I>T. hirtum</I></B> All., strain S.6), and subterranean clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I></B> L.  cv 'Bacchus') in pure plantings and in 1:1 mixtures of two species.  Competition for light was assessed in relation to leaf area and leaf position in the canopy.  Leaf area in 4-cm horizontal strata, leaf weight, shoot weight production, and light penetration through canopies were measured at intervals during the vegetative phase (i.e., through 99 days after sowing). Williams (1963) found that crimson and rose clovers held apparent initial advantages over subterranean clover, in terms of light-absorbing surface area of cotyledons and first unifoliate leaves, and because these leaves were elevated further from the soil surface.  However, this situation changed with time.  In paired sowings, crimson and subterranean clover became equally dominant over rose clover, while subterranean clover overtopped crimson despite the greater total leaf area of the latter.  The most productive mixture (cirmson clover + subterranean clover) was no more productive than the best species (crimson clover) in monoculture. Competition has other dimensions than those reported here, including the advantage conferred by hardseededness of rose clover, which enables it to dominate polyspecific stands following droughts that kill seedlings of the other two clovers.<P> Subterranean clover is susceptible to shading by associated grasses, and benefits from removal of most plant residues before autumn (McGuire, 1985).<P> Williams et al.  (1968) stated that subterranean clover has, on the average, larger seed than does crimson clover, and plot studies indicated that the former will tend to dominate in mixtures due to more rapid early growth and shading of the crimson clover.  When larger seeds of crimson clover were selected and interseeded with smaller seeds of subterranean clover, the pattern was reversed. Crimson clover was not eliminated from any of the mixtures evaluated.<P> Bade et al.  (1988) reported that on neutral and alkaline soils, competition by burclover and its rhizobia can interfere with establishing subterranean clover stands.  Burclover is very sensitive to 2,4-D herbicide, and can be removed with an application of 0.75 lb/a.<P> McGuire (1985) wrote that when a mixture of white clover and subterranean clover is sown, white clover completely dominates the moist sites, and subterranean clover dominates the dry sites.<P> Subterranean clovers can also be grown with grasses.  In California, McGowan and Williams (1971) found that a cereal companion crop (barley) can increase the forage produced in the first year of sowing while permitting good growth and seed production of subterranean clover.  This was determined on nine sites in the Sacramento Valley and adjacent foothills.  Where grain yields were 2,000 kg/ha or less and soil moisture was adequate in April (the last month of the rainy season), undersown clover produced 3000 to 5000 kg/ha of seed, over 100 seeds per plant, and grain yields were not reduced by the undersowing. Subterranean clover (cv 'Woogenellup') is apparently compatible in mixture with soft chess ('Blando' brome), at least with periodic mowing (Phillips et al., 1983).  Subterranean clover is sown along with perennial ryegrass on Oregon rangelands (McGuire, 1985).  Shock et al.  (1984) found that association with nonlegumes soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I></B> L.) or filaree (<I>Erodium</I></B> spp.) increased the percentage of N derived from fixation by subterranean clover.<P> Forcella and Gill (1986) found that tillage can be timed to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn.  Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P> Evers (1988) reported that benefits of subclover are maximized when it is grown with a warm season perennial grass such as bermudagrass, bahiagrass, or dallisgrass.  Planting in established sod is less expensive than on a prepared seedbed. However, stand establishment is more difficult due to competition. Avoiding the use of nitrogen fertilizer in late summer and in the late fall during establishment has improved stand and quantity of subclover. Subclover drilled into a bermudagrass sod produced 49% more forage than when the seed was broadcast.  Success with broadcast seed on a grass sod is improved if planting is delayed until November when temperatures are cooler.<P> In combination with 'Coastal' bermudagrass (a warm-season grass) in Texas, annual dry matter biomass yields (kg/ha) for 'Mt. Barker' subterranean clover were as follows: 3,681; 2,430; and 1,636 kg/ha. In combination with common Bermuda grass (a warm-season grass) in Texas, annual dry matter biomass yields (kg/ha) for a mixture of subterranean clovers were as follows: 407; 937; and 1,349 kg/ha (Bade et al., 1988).<P> Christensen (1971) proposed using winter cover crops in Californian vineyards, with the aim of producing a sod-like condition.  Cover crops would be low growing, require little or no mowing, and be self re-seeding.  Their functions would be to reduce tillage and dust, provide habitat for predators that attack spider mites, improve water penetration, and provide nitrogen. Annual grasses suggested include barley, 'Blando' brome, or rye. Subterranean clovers recommended include cv 'Geraldton', Dwalganup', 'Howard', and 'Mt. Barker'.  Rose clovers included cv 'Kondinin' and 'Hykon'.  Medics suggested were California bur clover, 'Cyprus' barrel medic, and 'Harbinger' barrel medic. Mixtures of subterranean clovers were suggested so that better adapted varieties will reseed.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Nematodes have been found on subclover roots in California and Australia, but their economic significance is unknown (Murphy et al., 1976).  Duke (1981) listed the following plant-parasitic nematodes as having been isolated from subclover: <I>Aphelenchoides pareitinus</I></B>, <I>Heliotylenchus dihystera</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne exigua</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B>, <I>M. hapla</I></B>, <I>M. javanica</I></B>, <I>Monohystera stagnalis</I></B>, <I>Pratylenchus zeae</I></B>, <I>P. pratensis</I></B>, and <I>Rotylenchus brevicaudatus</I></B>.  All twelve cultivars tested by Pung et al.  (1988) were good hosts for <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B>; subterranean clover also is susceptible to root knot nematode <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B>.<P> Kouame et al., (1989) reported that very limited genetic resistance is available to root-knot nematodes among subterranean clover lines.  Evaluation of 134 line of subterranean clovers showed that these have limited resistance to <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp., which collectively constitute the most important group of plant-parasitic nematodes.  This could indicate problems for succeeding vegetable crops.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover (Duke, 1981) and subclover (Duke, 1981; Finch & Sharp, 1983) the common names.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover tolerates close grazing, and its large seeds confer easy establishment and early fall production; it can also suppress weeds with its thick cover (Bade et al., 1988).  Finch & Sharp (1983) mentioned that weed control is usually required during establishment of subterranean clover because it is a poor competitor.  Therefore, competing weeds should be mowed to a height of 2-4 inches.  Mowing or grazing are important in weed control (Graves et al., 1986; Miller et al., 1989), with the preferred height being under 4 inches.<P> Evers and Smith (1988) reported that good stands of subclover quickly form a thick canopy that compete well with other plants. Thin subclover stands show weed problems.  Planting sites with low weed densities helps avoid problems.  Residual herbicides could be a problem.  Early land preparation permits weed seed germination and destruction before planting clover.  A spring mowing, after winter weeds flower but before seeds are produced, reduces subsequent weed densities.<P> Enache and Ilnicki (in press) conducted a study of subterranean clover (cv 'Nangeela') grown as a living mulch for sweet corn (<I>Zea mays</I></B> L., cv 'Midstates 747').  A field experiment, conducted over 3 years (1986-1988), involved two factors: (1) type of mulch including subterranean clover living mulch, dead mulch of cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B> L.), and no mulch; (2) type of tillage including conventional, minimum, and no tillage. Subterranean clover living mulch effectively controlled ivyleaf morningglory (<I>Ipomoea hederacea</I></B> [L.] Jacq.).  The living mulch did not suppress fall panicum (<I>Panicum dicotomiflorum</I></B> Michaux) in 1986 but did so during the subsequent two years.  Weed biomass was reduced by all living mulch combinations.  Corn silage and grain yields from the no-tillage + living mulch treatment were comparable to, or higher than, those obtained with the conventional tillage + no mulch treatment.<P> A field trial by Katz and Ilnicki (1989) assessed soybean (<I>Glycine max</I></B> [L.] Merr. cv 'Pella') production as affected by a subterranean clover intercrop.  Two factors were evaluated: (1) Cover crop: subterranean clover or fallow; and (2) Management of cover crop: double disking, seeding barley, glyphosate for control of subterranean clover and weeds, and an untreated check. Subterranean clover led to reduced yield by soybean but did not effect stand density.  Subterranean clover reduced weed biomass by as much as 90%.<P> Enache et al. (1989) evaluated subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L., cv 'Nangeela') as a living mulch for sweet corn (<I>Zea mays</I></B> saccharata L., cv 'Seneca', 'Paleface', 'Biqueen', and 'Crossword').  Mowing and three preemergence herbicides were considered for value in weed control: cyanazine alone, and cyanazine, atrazine, and metolachlor applied in combination.  Weeds at the site included yellow nutsedge (<I>Cyperus esculentus</I></B> L.), fall panicum (<I>Panicum dichotomiflorum</I></B> Michaux), large crabgrass (<I>Digitaria sanguinalis</I></B> L.), and barnyardgrass (<I>Echinochloa crus-galli</I></B> [L.] Beauv.).  Subterranean clover used as a living mulch provided excellent weed control.  Weed control and yields were best for 'Biqueen'.  Mowed clover outperformed unmowed clover in terms of weed control and yield. Cyanazine applied alone injured the corn crop slightly and reduced yields.  All other herbicide treatments gave better weed control and consistently high yields.  Yields from living mulch treatments were either equal to or slightly lower than those for herbicide-treated conventional tillage, but higher than those for untreated conventional tillage.<P> Enache and Ilnicki (1989) evaluated subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L., cv 'Nangeela') as a living mulch for corn.  Field experiments, conducted over 2 years (1986-1987), involved two factors: (1) type of mulch: subterranean clover living mulch, dead mulch of cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B> L.), and no mulch; (2) type of tillage: conventional, minimum, and no tillage. Weed control by subterranean clover living mulch was rated good to excellent in 1986 for ivyleaf morningglory (<I>Ipomoea hederacea</I></B> [L.] Jacq.), velvetleaf (<I>Abutilion theophrasti</I></B> Medicius), horseweed (<I>Conyza canadensis</I></B> L.), and jimsonweed (<I>Datura stramonium</I></B> L.).  During 1987, control was good to excellent for iveyleaf morningglory, common lambsquarters (<I>Chenopodium album</I></B> L.), redroot pigweed (<I>Amaranthus retroflexus</I></B> L.), and common ragweed (<I>Ambrosia artemisifolia</I></B> L.).  The living mulch did not suppress fall panicum (<I>Panicum dicotomiflorum</I></B> Michaux) in 1986, but did so during 1987.  Total weed biomass was greatly reduced in all living mulch combinations.  Conventional tillage + no mulch performed best in terms of corn grain yields and silage, but economic analysis showed better net performance by living mulch + no tillage.<P> Guerrero and Williams (1975) conducted growth chamber studies involving filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I></B>) and subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> cv 'Woogenellup') grown in sole and mixed cultures in a phosphorus-deficient range soil (from Butte County) and in sand with differing levels of supplemental nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.  Filaree dominated if phosphorus was limiting, whereas subterranean clover did so if nitrogen were left out of the fertilizer.  Subterranean clover has a higher requirement for phosphorus than does filaree, and also appears less capable of exploiting insoluble phosphatic sources.  Addition of superphosphate to rangeland soils is suggested as a means of promoting subterranean clover.<P> Moore et al., (1989) concluded that, based on pot experiments in Australia, subterranean clover can suppress the seedlings of the perennial weed St. John's Wort by overtopping the seedlings and shading them out.  This confirmed earlier (1942) findings that subterranean clover could suppress the weed if sown into native pastures, particularly if phosphate fertilizers had been applied. The importance of maintaining a closed canopy of subterranean clover during the early phase of weed seedling growth is emphasized.<P> 'Meteora' is highly competitive with grasses and other herbs and maintains a high clover percentage in hay cuts (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Cv 'Koala' appeared particularly good at suppressing weeds in a preliminary trial of 11 cultivars of subterranean clover in southern Georgia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Vegetational cover data were measured for cover crops in a replicated trial (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991. Vegetational cover data (Mean % +/- S.E.M.) were as follows: 'Koala': 94.50+/-3.33%; 'Dalkeith': 87.50+/-4.33%; 'Trikkala': 96.25+/-1.25%; 'Mt. Barker': 96.25+/-1.25%; 'Seaton Park': 92.50+/-2.50% (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> Weed above-ground biomass data (dry) were taken in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990; harvest was on May 15-16, 1991.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  Data were as follows (Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.): 'Koala': 0.086+/-0.086; 'Dalkeith': 2.297+/-0.036; 'Trikkala': 1.608+/-0.694; 'Mt.Barker': 0.581+/-0.269; 'Seaton Park': 0.951+/-0.391 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>In general, seed has intermediate longevity (McLeod, 1982), with hardseeded cultivars showing extended viability (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Christensen (1971) proposed that in Californian vineyards, French plowing would leave a narrow strip of cover crops in each alley and would permit use of early-maturing species like brome grass, bur clover, 'Geraldton' subterranean clover, and the rose clovers.  Mowing cover crops could reduce the threat of frost. Dates for plowing down cover crops depends on the maturation dates early to mid-June for subterranean clovers.<P> No-till management resulted in better reestablishment of subterranean clover stands than did spring tillage (Dabney et al., 1989)<P> Forcella and Gill (1986) reported that tillage can be timed to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn.  Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Subterranean clovers collectively have the greatest use of any annual clovers (McGuire, 1985).  Advantages to subterranean clover include its tolerance of close grazing, its ease of establishment and early fall production due to large seed size, and its suppression of weeds (Bade et al., 1988).  Duke (1981) noted that subterranean clover is useful for pasture when grown with companion grasses, and that it is also suitable for silage or hay; its decumbent habit and mat of creeping stems make it suitable for erosion control.  Miller et al. (1989) wrote that subterranean clover is the most productive legume for use in orchards and vineyards below 4,000 feet. Finch & Sharp (1983) recommended its use in orchards and vineyards below 3,000 feet.  Peaceful Valley (1988) cited it as useful for dryland and drip irrigated orchards, including uncultivated almonds, and vineyards, and described it as excellent for range land reseeding and hilly land.  Other applications include intercropping with grains on acidic soils (Peaceful Valley, 1988) and green manure (McLeod, 1982).<P> Glatzle (1989) described ley-farming systems (cereal grain production alternating with pasture) with annual, self-regenerating legumes as being increasingly used in areas with Mediterranean climate.  In particular, practices in southern and southwestern Australia involve the use of self-regenerating stands of annual medics (<I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B>, <I>M. truncatula</I></B>, <I>M. littoralis</I></B>, <I>M tornata</I></B>, <I>M scutellata</I></B>, and <I>M. rugosa</I></B>) and subterranean clovers (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L., ssp.  <I>subterraneum, brachycalycinum</I></B>, and <I>yanninicum</I></B>).  Advantages include production of high-quality forage, need to sow pasture but once, increased yield of cereal in response to nitrogen added by pasture legumes, soil protection and improvement, and stabilization of farmers' incomes.<P> Subterraneum clover is used in grass mixtures, particularly warm- season perennial grasses like bermudagrass, kleingrass, bahiagrass, and dallisgrass. Grasses are most productive when clover is not present.  During the period when both are growing, the pasture must be managed to favor the clover. Subclover matures about the time that summer grasses initiate active growth (Ocumpaugh, 1988).<P> Wick and Alleweldt (1983) found that when grown together in containers, subterranean clover cv 'Clare' caused a 20% reduction in growth by Riesling grape vines.  The mechanism for this inhibition was not known, and it occurred regardless of the level of nitrogen fertilization.  No such inhibitory effect was seen for subterranean clover cv 'Daliak' or for white clover.  The legumes supplied nitrogen to the vines when only low amounts of nitrogen were added, and there was higher use of water by vines with legumes.<P> When grown outside in a young vineyard in Germany, 'Daliak' showed more rapid early growth than white clover, but was damaged by frost and did not reseed (Wick and Alleweldt, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that subterranean clover seed can be harvested when the plants are dead and thoroughly dry.  Harvest by mowing close to the ground with a tractor-drawn power take-off lespedeza cutter bar, and windrowing.  For especially dense stands, it is important to have pea lifter guards that attach over the upper surface of the bars. Alternatively, if the plants are thoroughly dry, mow with a standard mower, then use a strong hay rake to pull up the runners and burs, and windrow.  Remaining heads can be vacuumed up.<P> McGuire (1985) reported that seed harvesting in Australia typically involves suction combines, after the soil surface is disturbed enough to allow the buried seed to be picked up and separated from the earth.  Seed yields can be as high as 2 Mg/ha, but 500-1,000 kg/ha is more typical.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover interferes little with workers because of its rather low stature (Duke, 1981; Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover shows moderate shade tolerance (Brinton, 1989).<P> Early- or mid-season-maturing cultivars of subterranean clover may be needed where orchard shade is dense.  On the other hand, based on observations in Contra Costa County apple orchards, moderate shade may improve growth and reproduction of later-maturing varieties by reducing evapotranspiration and resultant water stress (Bugg, 1990).  In dense shade of a mature walnut orchard Russell Lester's (Solano Co.), subterranean clovers, remained green until June 17, when 'Lana' vetch had already turned brown due to lack of irrigation (Bugg, pers. comm., 1993).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover can deplete soil moisture if not grazed heavily during a dry spring (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), subclover tolerates mean annual temperatures of 5.9-21.3 C, with a mean of 34 cases of 14.4 C. Subterranean clovers include a large number of varieties representing wide ranges of maturation dates and of low-temperature requirements for reproduction (McGuire, 1985). The species is well adapted to Mediterranean climate of cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988). Cool, moist, mild winters are essential for persistence (Hofstetter, 1988). There are both warm and cold boundaries to subterranean clover production. Flowering by subclovers is induced by low temperatures (vernalization).  Late-maturing cultivars are prevented from flowering by lack of cold; early-maturing cvv may be required in warm areas.  By contrast, protracted cold weather can delay flowering and seed set (McGuire, 1985). Once established, seedlings can survive temperatures as low as 10 F (McLeod, 1982).  In the Willamette Valley of Oregon, -14 degrees Centigrade accompanied by dry wind led to complete loss of pastures of 'Nageela', 'Mt. Barker', and 'Tallarook'.  In other areas, subterranean clover stands (rosette stage, mid-season and late cultivars) have recovered after temperatures as low as -20 degrees Centigrade. 'Clare' stands were lost in Mississippi after a low temperature of -15 C; other strains survived (McGuire, 1985).  Cv 'Yarloop' is subject to frost injury, according to Murphy et al.  (1976).<P> Temperature effect on vegetative growth were studied at three diurnal temperature regimes.  Subclover showed a linear increase in relative growth rate with temperature up to 15 to 25 C (Guerrero and Williams, 1975).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>In general, subterranean clover matures during May (Finch & Sharp, 1983), but there are large number of varieties representing a wide range of maturation dates (McGuire, 1985). Cultivars are grouped according to the length of time required to reach maturity or seed set, as early, early mid-season, mid-season, and late-season (Murphy et al., 1976).  The earliest and latest strains may differ by as much as 60 days (McLeod, 1982).<P> McLeod (1982) listed the following as early maturing: 'Geraldton,' 'Dwalganup,' 'Daliak.' Mid-season-maturing cultivars are 'Dinninup,' 'Woogenellup,' and 'Mt.  Baker,' with 'Tallarook' listed as late maturing and requiring five months to mature. 'Yarloop' was stated to require ample water, and 'Clare' to tolerate high pH.<P> Early-maturing, relatively-hardseeded Australian varieties include 'Nungarin,' 'Northam,' 'Dalkeith' (Miller et al., 1989).<P> According to Miller et al.  (1989), early- to mid-early-season maturing varieties include 'Nungarin,' 'Northam,' 'Geraldton,' 'Daliak,' 'Dalkeith'. Early-mid-season to mid-season varieties include 'Seaton Peak,' 'Trikkala,' 'Enfield,' and 'Esperance'. Mid-season varieties include 'Clare,' 'Woogenellup,' 'Howard,' and 'Mt.  Barker'.  Late mid-season cultivars include 'Larisa,' 'Nangella,' and 'Meteora.' Late varieties include 'Tallarook.'<P> McLeod (1982) listed 'Geraldton,' 'Dwalganup,' and 'Daliak' as early varieties, 'Dinninup,' 'Woogenellup,' and 'Mt.  Baker' as mid-season cultivars, and 'Tallarook' as late.<P> Low rainfall, high evaporation, shallow soils with southern exposure, or high elevations can lead to short growing seasons, favoring early strains like 'Geraldton,' 'Dwalganup,' or 'Daliak.' Where growing seasons are longer, mid- season strains like 'Dinninup,' 'Woogenellup,' or 'Mt.  Barker,' would be suitable. The late strain 'Tallarook' requires at least a five months (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Early-maturing varieties like 'Geraldton,' 'Northam,' and 'Nungarin' are recommended for areas with short growing season (e.g., San Diego County) (Graves et al., 1986). 'Enfield' matures a little earlier than 'Woogenellup' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981), whereas 'Green Range' matures in early mid season, about the same time as cv 'Woogenellup' (AHPRA, 1985). 'Junee' maturation is a week or more earlier than 'Woogenellup,' or about the same as cv 'Esperance' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981). 'Karridale' matures in mid-season, about the same time as cv 'Mt. Barker' and 6-9 days after cvv 'Green Range' and 'Woogenellup' (AHPRA, 1985).  'Meteora' shows late mid-season maturity (7-10 days later than cv 'Mt. Barker') (Mackay and Barnard, 1981). 'Trikkala' matures early; the trait is derived from a simply inherited Neuchatel gene which may produce earlier than normal flowering with a very early seasonal break (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Because of the varying tolerances of the three species of subterranean clover, soil conditions do not usually restrict production.  Temperature and rainfall, however, do (McGuire, 1985). Duke (1981) reported that subterranean clover tolerates mean annual precipitation of 3.8-16.3 dm, with the mean of 34 cases bing 9.0 (35.42 inches).  McGuire (1985) reported that high summer rainfall can prompt premature germination of sub clover seed and decrease its persistence.<P> Subterranean clover has been said to require 10 inches or more of rain (Murphy et al., 1976; Peaceful Valley, 1988), 12 inches of irrigation or rainfall (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and 20 inches of annual rainfall (McLeod, 1982).<P> Minimum rainfall requirements (in inches) were given by Murphy et al. (1976).  Seasonal distribution is important as well as total rainfall.  In general, later-maturing cultivars rquire more and later rain than do early varieties.  Minimum rainfall values indicate that the clover should be expected to reseed in an area of the state with the long-term annual rainfall indicated:<P>

 'Enfield' grows well in a range of environments from 450 mm annual rainfall to 900 mm annual
rainfall (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).
</PRE>
Cv 'Junee' is adapted to areas where cvv 'Woogenellup' and 'Esperance' are grown, where it may be more persistent than 'Woogenellup' and possibly 'Green Range,' especially where summer rainfall is heavy and rainfall variability is high, or where cropping is relatively frequent.  Because of its large proportion of hard seed, it may be able to extend into some areas of shorter or less reliable growing season where cv 'Seaton Park' is now grown (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Karridale' has tolerated high-rainfall areas of southern mainland Australia, giving good winter and very good spring production.  It has been seen as a direct replacement for cv 'Mt. Barker,' and perhaps 'Woogenellup' in the wet part of that cultivar's range (AHPRA, 1985).<P> Cv 'Meteora' tolerates waterlogging; its growth in flooded conditions is 93% of unflooded controls and similar to cv 'Yarloop' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981), which also tolerates high soil water (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> The subterranean clover varieties 'Nungarin,' 'Seaton Park,' and 'Woogenellup' were evaluated under various watering and defoliation regimes. Development of hard (impermeable) seed in 'Nungarin' and 'Seaton Park' was reduced by continuous watering. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yield in all three varieties tested.  Defoliation prolonged flowering. On the other hand, defoliation before flowering is known to increase seed yield (Archer, 1990).<P> Seed of cv 'Seaton Park' exhibits embyo dormancy, which prevents germination despite permeable seedcoat and imbibition of water. This appears to have some value in protecting seed from microbial attack as well as out-of-season germination (Archer, 1990).<P> Earlier maturing, shorter-statured subclover causes less moisture depletion for associated warm-season grass than later maturing, taller clovers (e.g., 'Yuchi' arrowleaf, 'Bigbee' berseem) (Bade et al., 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover is susceptible to shading by associated grasses, and it benefits from removal of most plant residues before autumn (McGuire, 1985). Subclover can produce seed even under continuous grazing (Bade et al., 1988). Several authors emphasized subclover's tolerance of mowing or grazing, and recommended mowing at 2-4 inch or 3-4 inch height during establishment and periodically thereafter, in order to reduce weeds (Finch & Sharp, 1983; Evers and Smith, 1988; Graves et al., 1986; Munoz & Graves, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988; Miller et al., 1989).  Miller et al. (1989) prescribed frequent mowing at 2-4 inches height to allow subclover to compete with weeds and to have a good seed set.<P> Evers and Smith (1988) noted that the low growth of subclover enables it to tolerate mowing.  If associated weeds show upright growth, mowing to 3- to 4- inch height will favor subclover. Spring mowing after winter weeds begin flowering but before seeds are produced will reduce weed densities the next year.<P> McGuire (1985) wrote that subterranean clover reseeds best when the canopy is opened up by grazing (or presumably mowing). Defoliation actually increases seed production.<P> Ocumpaugh (1988) wrote that while managing mixed stands, these should be grazed short (or, presumably in orchards or vineyards, mowed) by the time subterranean clover seedlings are germinating. Continuous grazing can begin after subclover seedlings have 4 to 6 trifoliate leaves.  Continue grazing until cool temperatures limit grass growth.  If reseeding is desired, do not overgraze during April and early May (in Texas) when seed is developing, especially if rainfall is below normal.<P> Archer (1990) evaluated the subterranean clover varieties 'Nungarin,' 'Seaton Park,' and 'Woogenellup' under various watering and defoliation regimes. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yield in all three varieties tested. Defoliation prolonged flowering.  By contrast, defoliation before flowering is known to increase seed yield.<P> Motazedian and Sharrow (1986) varied mowing height and frequency in mixed stands of subterranean clover and perennial ryegrass. In stands dominated by perennial ryegrass, greater stubble heights led to greater productivity; the opposite was true for stands dominated by subterranean clover.  The greatest interval between defoliations (49 days) led to the greatest productivity of the stands.<P> Phillips et al.  (1983) concluded that subterranean clover (cv 'Woogenellup') is apparently compatible in mixture with soft chess ('Blando' brome), at least with periodic mowing.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that subterranean clover is assigned to the Mediterranean and Australian Centers of Diversity and ranges from the Cool Temperate Steppe top Wet through Subtropical Dry to Moist Forest Life Zones, and is adapted to areas with more than 400 mm of annual rainfall and below 1,000 m in elevation. Munz (1973) did not mention the species as naturalized in California, but it is widespread in hills of the North Coast counties, and is common in Mendocino County grazing lands (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Nearly all varieties of subterranean clover were first developed in Australia (McGuire, 1985).<P> Geographic suitabilities in California have been variously described.  Graves et al.  (1986) asserted suitability at elevations below 3500 feet, whereas Peaceful Valley (1988) stated that the species is suited for areas with 10 inches or more of rain, below 3000 ft., and McLeod (1982) stipulated 20 inches of annual rainfall and below 3,300 ft.<P> In western San Diego County below 3500' elevation, Murphy et al., (1976) suggested 'Geraldton,' 'Nungarin' and 'Northam.' With limited irrigation from September through June and at elevations below 4,000, 'Seaton Park,' 'Trikkala,' 'Enfield', and 'Meteora' are suitable.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Subclover seedlings should have 3 to 8 nodules when they reach the three-leaf stage in presence of proper rhizobia and are more vigorous and have more leaves and nodules than crimson and arrowleaf clovers at 3 and 7 weeks after planting (Evers, 1988).<P> During establishment, the force produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the weight of overlying soil and surface crusts. Williams (1956) used glass tubes containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass to estimate the force produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean clover, and alfalfa. Mean forces exerted (in g, +/- SEM) were estimated as follows. Alfalfa: 15.2 +/- 0.5 g; crimson clover: 23.8 +/- 0.2; rose clover 24.1 +/- 0.5; subterranean clover 60.0 + 2.9.  The force exerted by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight, but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting that other factors may operate, as well.<P> As noted by McGuire (1985), taxonomic distinction of subclovers is clearest at flowering.  Nonetheless, seedlings do exhibit some morphological differences; for example, 'Junee' seedlings are prostrate, relatively small and fine, with unifoliate leaf moderately hairy and with a small central crescent spot and narrow white arms curving down to the leaf lower margin (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Karridale' seedlings are erect, with unifoliate leaf moderately hairy, with a small and inconstant crescent spot in the center (AHPRA.  1985).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover tolerates close grazing, has large seeds that make establishment easier and enable early fall production, and is weed suppressive (Bade et al., 1988).  Nonetheless, Finch & Sharp (1983) noted that weed control is usually required in the establishment phase, because young subterranean clover plants are poor competitors.  Mow competing weeds to a height of 2-4 inches during establishment .<P> Ocumpaugh (1988) wrote that while managing mixed stands, these should be grazed short (or, presumably in orchards or vineyards, mowed) by the time subterranean clover seedlings are germinating. Continuous grazing can begin after subclover seedlings have 4 to 6 trifoliate leaves.  Continue grazing until cool temperatures limit grass growth.  If reseeding is desired, do not overgraze during April and early May (in Texas) when seed is developing, especially if rainfall is below normal.<P> As reported by Williams (1956), during establishment, the force produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the weight of overlying soil and surface crusts.  Using glass tubes containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass, the force produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean clover, and alfalfa was estimated.  Mean forces exerted (in g, +/- SEM) were estimated as follows.  Alfalfa: 15.2 +/- 0.5 g; crimson clover: 23.8 +/- 0.2; rose clover 24.1 +/- 0.5; subterranean clover: 60.0 +/- 2.9. The force exerted by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting that other factors may operate, as well.<P> Tillage can be timed to determine floristic composition of swards, as noted by Forcella and Gill (1986).  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn.  Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter. Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the following fungi as having been isolated from subterranean clover: <I>Cercospora medicaginsis</I></B>, <I>C. zebrina</I></B>, <I>Erysiphe communis</I></B>, <I>E.  polygoni</I></B>, <I>Kabatiella caulivora</I></B>, <I>Pellicularia filamentosa</I></B>, <I>Physoderma  trifolii</I></B>,  <I>Pleospora herbaum</I></B>, <I>Pseudopeziza trifolii</I></B>, <I>Pseodoplea trifolii</I></B>, <I>Rhizoctonia solani</I></B>, <I>Sclerotinia homeocarpa</I></B>, <I>S. trifoliorum</I></B>, <I>Sclerotium bataticola</I></B>, <I>Uromyces trifolii</I></B>.  Duke (1981) further mentioned that stem rot is the most serious disease, with powdery mildew and leaf rust less important.<P> Seed of cv 'Seaton Park' exhibits embyo dormancy, which prevents germination despite permeable seedcoat and imbibition of water. This appears to have some value in protecting seed from microbial attack as well as out-of-season germination (Archer, 1990).<P> Clover scorch, caused by the fungus <I>Kabatiella caulivora</I></B>, and root rots, caused by <I>Pythium</I></B> and/or <I>Fusarium</I></B> species, are the primary subclover disease problems in Australia (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988).<P>

 'Enfield' was suggested for areas where 'Woogenellup' suffers severe damage from clover scorch (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> In Western Australia, 'Green Range' has shown good winter and spring production and good persistence.  It should be a suitable scorch-resistant replacement for cv 'Woogenellup' over much of that cultivar's range in Western Australia, excepting perhaps the wetter fringe and coastal areas where cv. Karridale may be better suited (AHPRA, 1985).<P> 'Meteora's' resistance to clover scorch, together with its tall habit and high spring yield, makes this cultivar well suited to high rainfall areas, particularly those where cattle production and fodder conservation are part of the farming system (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Powdery mildew (<I>Erysiphe polyoni</I></B>) is quite common as a very thin, white, powdery growth on leaves of subclover in coastal areas in late spring (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Subterranean clover is subject to damage by root rot by the fungi <I>Pythium, Fusarium</I></B>, and <I>Rhizoctonia</I></B>, and to the viral diseases clover stunt, bean yellow mosaic, and red leaf (McGuire, 1985).<P> Mackay and Barnard (1981) wote that 'Enfield' is more tolerant to clover scorch than 'Woogenellup' but is slightly less tolerant than 'Daliak' and 'Esperance.' It shows symptoms of the disease but there are fewer lesions per petiole than with 'Woogenellup' and the sward suffer less damage<P> Cv 'Esperance' tolerates root rot (<I>Pythium spp.</I></B>) better than do cvv 'Seaton Park,' 'Woogenellup' and 'Mt.  Barker.' 'Esperance' is an alternative to clover scorch-resistant cultivars 'Seaton Park,' 'Dinninup,' and 'Woogenellup' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> According to AHPRA (1985), cv 'Green Range' resists clover scorch, <I>Kabatiella caulivora</I></B> and may resist or escape from subterranean clover mosaic virus.  'Green Range' is, however, highly susceptible to rust, <I>Uromyces trifolii</I></B>.

Cv 'Junee' is not tolerant of root-rot where the main pathogen is <I>Phytophthora</I></B>.

However, this will probably not be a significant problem in the areas for which it is likely to be recommended.<P> 'Karridale' resists clover scorch, <I>Katabiella caulivora</I></B>, well.  It shows above-average resistance to the complex of clover root rot organisms, <I>Pythium, Rhizoctonia</I></B> and <I>Fusarium</I></B>, prevalent in Western Australia. Also, it is slightly inferior to that of cvv.  'Daliak,' 'Dinninup,' and 'Junee,' slightly better than that of cv.  'Green Range,' and much better than that of cvv. 'Woogenellup' and 'Mt.  Barker.' Data from Tasmania suggest moderate resistance to subterranean clover red leaf virus (AHPRA, 1985).<P> Cv 'Meteora' is the most resistant (superior to 'Trikkala' and 'Larisa') of all the <I>yanninicum</I></B> cultivars to clover scorch, and it shows resistance as a seedling.  It is at least equally tolerant to root rots in the field in Western Australia as are 'Trikkala' and 'Larisa,' and is better than 'Yarloop' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Generalizations on N content of subclover are as follows: up to 100 or more lbs/acre/year (Haby, 1988), 50-200 lb of N per acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988); 207 kg/ha (FAO, 1984); and 114 kg/ha mean N content of three year field trial in Georgia (Hargrove, 1986). In unirrigated pasture, subterranean clover adds about 45 lb/a of nitrogen (Holland et al., 1969).  A review article by Smith et al. (1987) reported an aboveground nitrogen content (kg/ha) of 114, proportion of nitrogen estimated obtained from fixation as 0.67, and the estimated N fertilizer equvalence under no-tillage regimes were given (kg/ha) as 12-103 (when followed by sorghum).<P> Subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L., cv 'Woogenellup') was used as a cover crop preceding rice (<I>Oryza sativa</I></B> L., cv 'Labelle') under 2 clover regimes (clover vs. fallow), 2 tillage regimes (rototilling vs. no tillage), and 4 levels of nitrogen fertilizer addition (as urea): 0, 56, 112, and 168 kg/ha.  Under the no-tillage regime, clover was suppressed by herbicide.  The subterranean clover contained from 70-110 kg N/ha prior to rice planting, and increased rice yields by about 10% across both tillage and all nitrogen regimes (Dabney et al., 1989).<P> Subterranean clover did not reduce the amount of nitrogen required to generate maximum rice yields (Dabney et al., 1989).<P> In southern Georgia, a study during 1988-89 indicated that in monocultural plots, subterranean clover varieties attained estimated above-ground nitrogen contents as follows (kg/ha): 'Meteora': 129.656 +/-6.886; 'Larisa': 147.132+/-55.387; 'Mt. Barker': 251.335+/-10.357; 'Esperance': 82.206; 'Nangeela': 121.021; 'Trikkala': 224.024+/-9.691; 'Junee': 102.681; 'Enfield': 132.110;  'Howard':  201.891;  'Koala': 202.439+/-14.125; 'Talarook': 168.409; Mississippi Ecotype: 166.266 (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Association with nonlegumes soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I></B> L.) or filaree (<I>Erodium</I></B> spp.) increased the percentage of N derived from fixation by subterranean clover (Shock et al., 1984).<P> Soil nitrogen and organic matter levels showed significant improvement after five years of subclover covercropping at Ramona, San Diego County (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover has the advantage of producing inaccessible (below-ground) seed, which ensures regeneration of the stands (McGuire, 1985). Duke (1981) described the seed as large, broadly ellipsoid, and purplish black, with 143,325 seeds/kg.  McGuire (1985) described the seed as black or purplish black, but white in the case of <I>Trifolium yanninicum</I></B> (e.g., 'Yarloop' [Murphy et al., 1976]).  'Meteora' seed is ovoid, cream to amber, and relatively large (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Trikkala' has large cream seeds (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Subclover has an establishment advantage over the other clover species because of its large seed (Evers, 1988).<P> Hard seed will not germinate at planting but will at some later date (Evers., 1988); this is apparently a survival mechanism in areas with erratic weather. Relative hard seededness varies among subclover cultivars, as recounted by Mackay and Barnard (1981) hardseededness ratings, on an increasing scale from 1 to 10 were:<P>

 'Junee' hard-seededness is high for its maturity, approaching that of cv. 'Dinninup' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Karridale': Seeds are medium sized and black (AHPRA, 1985).<P> 'Karridale' hardseededness is moderately low, similar to or slightly higher than that of cv 'Woogenellup' and higher than that of cv 'Mt.  Barker' (AHPRA, 1985).<P> 'Green Range' hard-seededness in Western Australia has been moderately high, equal to or a little higher than that of cvv. Seaton Park and Esperance and clearly higher than that of cv. Woogenellup.  In New South Wales tests, hard-seededness has only been similar to that of cv.  Woogenellup.  Burr burial approximates that of cv.  Woogenellup.  (AHPRA, 1985.)<P> The subterranean clover varieties 'Nungarin', 'Seaton Park', and 'Woogenellup' were evaluated under various watering and defoliation regimes. Development of hard (impermeable) seed in 'Nungarin' and 'Seaton Park' was reduced by continuous watering. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yield in all three varieties tested.  Defoliation prolonged flowering. On the other hand, defoliation before flowering is known to increase seed yield (Archer, 1990).<P> Seed of cv 'Seaton Park' exhibits embyo dormancy, which prevents germination despite permeable seedcoat and imbibition of water.

 Subterranean clover seed contains 30-40% protein (McGuire, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover has the advantage of of inaccessible (below-ground) seed, which ensures regeneration of the stands (McGuire, 1985).  Subterranean clover is susceptible to shading by associated grasses, and benefits from removal of most plant residues before autumn (McGuire, 1985).  To maintain subclover stands, mow periodically during winter and early spring (Graves et al., 1986).  McGuire (1985) wrote that subterranean clover reseeds best when the canopy is opened up by grazing (or presumably mowing).  Defoliation actually increases seed production.<P> Ocumpaugh (1988) wrote that while managing mixed stands, these should be grazed short (or, presumably in orchards or vineyards, mowed) by the time subterranean clover seedlings are germinating. Continuous grazing can begin after subclover seedlings have 4 to 6 trifoliate leaves.  Continue grazing until cool temperatures limit grass growth.  If reseeding is desired, do not overgraze during April and early May (in Texas) when seed is developing, especially if rainfall is below normal.<P> Dabney et al.  (1989) found that no-till management resulted in better reestablishment of subterranean clover stands than did spring tillage.<P> Bugg et al.  (unpublished data) found that under no-till management in an organic vineyard in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, subclovers were seeded in replicated plots in October 1990 and evaluated for reestablishment in the spring of 1992. Cvv 'Koala,' 'Mt.  Barker,' and 'Trikkala.'showed good re-establishment in the second year, but 'Dalkeith' and 'Seaton Park' did not.  This may have been related to the hardseededness and embryo dormancy discussed by Archer (1990).<P> Forcella and Gill (1986) reported that tillage can be timed to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn.  Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P> Graves et al.  (1987) conducted a 6-year study in southern and central Californian grasslands under medium to heavy grazing. These scientists found that several Spanish subterranean clovers with hardseededness showed better persistence and vegetational coverage than did the more commonly-available Australian varieties 'Geraldton', 'Nungarin', and 'Daliak'.  Particularly promising were the Spanish strains 312-A, 92, 59, and 1142.  All the Spanish strains flowered later than 'Nungarin', which is of concern because early maturation helps ensure reproduction in years with no late rains.  Strain 312-A showed the latest flowering, 6 weeks after 'Nungarin', but also the best persistence.<P> In a follow-up study, Graves et al.  (1991) reported that hardseeded Spanish subterranean clovers show as good or better persistence on southern and central Californian foothills and coastal areas than does the most persistent Australian cultivar, 'Geraldton', and show lower concentrations of estrogenic compounds.<P> Archer (1990) evaluated the subterranean clover varieties 'Nungarin', 'Seaton Park', and 'Woogenellup' under various watering and defoliation regimes. Development of hard (impermeable) seed in 'Nungarin' and 'Seaton Park' was reduced by continuous watering. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yield in all three varieties tested.  Defoliation prolonged flowering. On the other hand, defoliation before flowering is known to increase seed yield.  Seed of cv 'Seaton Park' exhibits embyo dormancy, which prevents germination despite permeable seedcoat and imbibition of water.  This appears to have some value in protecting seed from microbial attack as well as out-of-season germination.<P> Richardson et al.  (1988) maintained that to ensure proper nodulation of subterranean clover throughout the rooting profile, lime should be incorporated, rather than merely placed on the soil surface.  Plants compensate for low pH by nodulating more in the less-acidic portions of the soil profile.  Inoculation and calcium coating of seeds did not alleviate poor nodulation in the acidic zones.  Nodulation of subterranean clover is reduced at solutions of pH lower than 5.0, and eliminated below 4.5.  Low numbers of rhizobia were present.  Nodulation is also sensitive to Al concentrations of 10 micromoles or greater.  These restrictions can be somewhat reduced by the addition of Ca and P.<P> Hill et al.  (1991) found that when paired with either 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak' subterranean clovers in a 3-year field replacement-series study, the cultivar 'Clare' (<I>Trifolium brachycalycinum</I></B>) dominated the mixed stands. Soil pH was 5.4-5.5; mowing was once every 4 weeks.  Petiolar length of 'Clare' is much greater than the early-maturing 'Daliak,' and slightly greater than the mid-season maturing 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' also showed better seedling vigor and survival and greater seed production per plant under stress.  Dry matter production by 'Clare' is less dependent on plant density. There was evidence of overyielding by mixtures of 'Clare' and 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' seed reserves appear to be more greatly reduced over the summer months than were those of 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak.' Cultivars of <I>Trifolium brachycalycinum</I></B> (e.g., 'Clare') supposedly suited mainly to neutral to alkaline soils and is believed less tolerant to close grazing and less able to bury its burrs than is <I>T. subterraneum</I></B> (e.g., 'Seaton Park,' 'Daliak').<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>As related by Murphy et al.  (1976), subclover cultivars vary in their concentrations of pigments that can have estrogenic effects on animals.  In nearly pure stands in Australia, estrogen levels of some subclover varieties have reduced lambing percentages.  This has not occurred in California because (1) subclover usually is not over 50 or 60 per cent of the stand even in the best pastures, and (2) subclover varieties high in estrogen ('Yarloop,' 'Dinninup,' 'Tallarook') have not been widely used or have usually been mixed with low-estrogen varieties.  Ratings for the cultivars follow:<P> 'Bacchus March': Low;<P> 'Clare': Low;<P> 'Daliak': Low;<P> 'Dinninup': High;<P> 'Dwalganup': High;<P> 'Geraldton': High;<P> 'Howard': High;<P> 'Mt.  Barker': Low;<P> 'Nangeela': Low;<P> 'Seaton Park': Low;<P> 'Tallarook': High;<P> 'Yarloop': High;<P> 'Woogenellup': Low.<P> 'Trikkala' contains only low concentrations (0.07-0.15%, dry weight) of plant oestrogen formononetin (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> In Werribee, Victoria, Australia, 'Enfield' contained 0.06 to 0.16 % of dry weight of formononetin, or about the same as 'Bacchus Marsh.' However, in Shenton Park, West Australia, from 1977 to 1981, 'Enfield' averaged 0.18 percent formononetin (range 0.07 to 0.31), whereas 'Bachus Marsh' averaged 0.03 percent (range 0.01 to 0.06) (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Formononetin content of cv 'Green Range' is very low, less than 0.10 percent (AHPRA, 1985).  Formononetin content of 'Junee' is low, about 0.10 percent (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).  'Karridale' Formononetin content is very low, less than 0.10 per cent (AHPRA, 1985).  'Meteora' contains from 0.20 to 0.35% dry weight of formononetin in the green leaves, which is above the maximum of 0.20% recommended for safety from oestrogenic effects in sheep, but it probably will not cause problems in mixed pastures in the high rainfall areas where the cultivar will be employed (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> Subterranean clover seed contains 30-40% protein (McGuire, 1985).<P> There have never been any observed cases of bloat by sheep or cattle grazing subclover, even in the purest of stands, confirmed by Monte Bell, Farm Advisor Emeritus, Glenn Co., CA.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) and McGuire (1985) both term subterranean clover a winter annual.  The species is self-fertile and cleistogamous (McGuire, 1985), and the flowers do not attract insect visitors (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Cocks (1990) reported that for various medics, up to 95% of fully-opened flowers abort, failing to produce mature pods.  By contrast, for subterranean clover, the range is from 23-63%.  Abortion may be a means of ensuring that seed are sufficiently large to produce viable seedlings.<P> After flowering, peduncles reflex and drive the seed heads underground (Duke, 1981).  As remarked by McGuire (1985), this provides the advantage of inaccessible (below-ground) seed, which ensures regeneration of the stands.<P> The subterranean clover varieties 'Nungarin', 'Seaton Park', and 'Woogenellup' were evaluated under various watering and defoliation regimes. Development of hard (impermeable) seed in 'Nungarin' and 'Seaton Park' was reduced by continuous watering. Repeated defoliation during flowering reduced seed yield in all three varieties tested.  Defoliation prolonged flowering. On the other hand, defoliation before flowering is known to increase seed yield (Archer, 1990).<P> Seed of cv 'Seaton Park' exhibits embyo dormancy, which prevents germination despite permeable seedcoat and imbibition of water. This appears to have some value in protecting seed from microbial attack as well as out-of-season germination (Archer, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Subterranean clover will self-seed readily (Miller, 1988; Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Subterranean clover does best at reseeding when the canopy is opened up by grazing (or presumably mowing). Defoliation actually increases seed production (McGuire, 1985). However, per McLeod's account (1982), grazing should be curtailed at flowering to allow reproduction.<P> Seed matures in the burr at or below the soil surface which allows seed production under moderately intensive grazing (Smith and Roquette, Jr., 1988). Evers and Smith (1988) confirmed that subclover can produce seed under close grazing, unlike most other annual clovers.  Moderate grazing to a 2- to 3-inch height increases seed production.  In Oregon studies, seed production is greatest when subclover is grazed until early burr formation. Moisture stress during flowering and seed maturation reduced yields.  Subterranean clover can produce in excess of 500 lbs of seed/acre in Oregon and produce from 200 to 400 lbs/acre in Texas.<P> Duke (1981) described seed harvest as entailing close mowing with a lespedeza cutter bar.  The residue is then windrowed.  Pea lifter guards attached above the bar are useful when the clover growth is especially heavy.  Alternatively, the clover can be mowed closely but above the seed heads with a standard mower. Then a strong hay rake can be used to pull up and windrow the runners and heads. Clover plants must be completely dry for this to be successful; remaining seed heads can be collected by vacuum.  Threshing can be done using stationary or combine threshers.<P> According to McGuire (1985), in Australia, burrs were long harvested using rakes, sweepers, and sheepskin rollers.  More recently, Australians have harvested using suction combines, after the soil surface is disturbed enough to allow the buried seed to be picked up and separated from the earth.  Seed yields can be as high as 2 Mg/ha, but 500-1,000 kg/ha is more typical.<P> For various medics, up to 95% of fully-opened flowers abort, failing to produce mature pods.  By contrast, for subterranean clover, the range is from 23-63%.  Abortion may be a means of ensuring that seed are sufficiently large to produce viable seedlings (Cocks, 1990).<P> Cv 'Enfield' produced more burrs per unit area and more seeds per burr than 'Woogenellup.' Seeds are small, and their density can be almost twice that of 'Woogenellup.' Most of the seed is formed above ground, as with 'Woogenellup' and 'Trikkala' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Esperance' shows high seed yields, and in studies conducted in Denmark with mild clover scorch infections in all treatments, 'Esperence' yields greatly exceeded those of 'Woogenellup' and 'Seaton Park' (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P> 'Geraldton' is an abundant seed producer (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> When rainfall is high (850 mm or greater), 'Meteora' seed yields have been satisfactory (400 kg/ha.  or greater), but this late variety produces an unusually high proportion of residual hard seeds (60% or more), and this may lead to low plant density in second-year stands if summers are cool (Mackay and Barnard, 1981).<P>

Cover crops have various effects, both beneficial and deleterious,
on orchard pest problems. Ideally, cover crops might be selected
or managed so as to: 1) not harbor important pests; 2) divert
generalist pests; 3) confuse specialist pests visually or olfactorally
and thus reduce their colonization of orchard trees; 4) alter
host-plant nutrition and thereby reduce pest success; 5) reduce
dust and thereby reduce spider mite outbreaks; 6) change the microclimate
and thereby reduce pest success; and 7) increase natural enemy
abundance or efficiency, thereby increasing biological control
of arthropod pests. This review article (65 references) examines
various studies of cover crops for tree nuts, pome fruits, stone
fruits, and citrus, with examples from the United States and Canada.
Only the Californian cases are detailed in this summary.<BR>

<H3>Almond</H3>

<P>
Two ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are particularly damaging
to almonds in central California: pavement ant <I>(Tetramorium
caespitum </I>[L.]) and southern fire ant <I>(Solenopsis xyloni
</I>McCook). These feed on nutmeats after the nuts have fallen
to the ground, and in a study by Barnett et al. (1989) were especially
damaging amid cover crops of soft chess <I>(Bromus mollis </I>L.,
cv 'Blando', Poaceae), strawberry clover <I>(Trifolium fragiferum
</I>L., cv 'Sauna', Fabaceae), and resident weedy vegetation,
as compared with residual herbicide. However, the same study showed
that cover crops of soft chess, strawberry clover or resident
vegetation accelerate the decomposition of unharvested almonds,
which otherwise represent an overwintering niche for navel orangeworm
<I>(Amyelois transitella </I>Walker, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae).
Breakdown prompted by moisture in cover crops and by flail mowing
greatly decreased the spring emergence of the moths. Thus, cover
cropping may enhance the control of one pest while exacerbating
others. This example illustrates the trade-offs implicit in different
management options. An ongoing comparison of organic and conventional
almond orchards by Lonnie Hendricks (1991) confirms that cover
crops can be an important tool in managing arthropod pests and
their natural enemies.<BR>

<H3>Walnut</H3>

<P>
Sluss (1967) found that convergent lady beetle <I>(Hippodamia
convergens </I>Guerin-Meneville) and <I>Olla abdominalis </I>(Say)
(now termed <I>0. v-nigrum </I>[Mulsant]) were the two most abundant
Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) attacking walnut aphid <I>(Chromaphis
juglandicola </I>[Kaltenbach], Homoptera: Aphididae) in Persian
walnut orchards of northern California. Sluss believed that ground
cover (of unspecified composition) can assist biological control
by convergent lady beetle because it harbors aphids (which serve
as alternate prey) from late February through
<P>
April or May. If ground cover is disked or chopped too early,
i.e., before walnut aphid is available as food, beetles will disperse
from the orchards. Such disengagement of the predators may lead
to subsequent eruptions of the aphid. Chopping of understory cover
killed many lady beetles, but some (including pupae) survived.
<I>Olla v-nigrum, </I>a principally arboreal lady beetle, tolerated
lower threshold densities of walnut aphid than did convergent
lady beetle (Sluss, 1967), and remained in trees during the late
spring and early summer, when the latter species dispersed to
other habitats.<BR>

<H3>Apple</H3>

<P>
In an unreplicated trial in northern California, Altieri and Schmidt
(1985, 1986) found that over a two-year period, codling moth infested
36.1 percent of the apples in an organic apple orchard with a
cover crop of bell beans <I>(Vicia faba </I>L.), whereas a nearby
clean-cultivated organic orchard suffered a 45 percent fruit loss
from this pest. Bell bean has extrafloral nectaries that attract
beneficial insects.<BR>

<H3>Cherry</H3>

<P>
In California, mountain leafhopper <I>(Colladonus montanus </I>[Van
Duzee], Homoptera: Cicadellidae) transmits a myco-plasma-like
organism that causes buckskin disease (X-disease) of cherry. This
leafhopper reproduces on cool-season <I>Medicago </I>spp. and
<I>Trifolium </I>spp. (Fabaceae), which may harbor the pathogen
(Purcell et al., 1987). Thus, there is circumstantial evidence
that cover crops of these groups should be used only with care
in cherry orchards. There are, however, no field studies showing
increased damage to cherry trees with undersown leguminous covercrops
(A. H. Purcell, pers. comm.). Apparently, the legume must survive
at least a full year to be an effective reservoir of the pathogen,
an atypical scenario for annual clovers and cool-season medics.
<BR>

<H3>Citrus and Avocado</H3>

<P>
Various grasses produce windblown pollen, used as an alternate
food by the predatory mite <I>Euseius tularensis </I>Congdon (Acari:
Phytoseiidae) (Kennett et al., 1979). This species and others
in the genus attack several pests of Californian citrus and avocado,
including avocado brown mite <I>(Oligonychus punicae </I>[Hirst],
Acari: Tetranychidae), citrus thrips <I>(Scirtothrips citri </I>Moulton,
Thysanoptera: Thripidae), citrus red mite <I>(Panonychus citri
</I>[McGregor], Acari: Tetranychidae), and scale crawlers (Homoptera:
Diaspididae) (Congdon and McMurtry, 1985). This mite can subsist
and reproduce on diets of various pollens (Zhimo and McMurtry,
1990). Deposition of windblown pollen during late winter and early
spring has been shown to be particularly important in hastening
the seasonal buildup of populations of these mites (Kennett et
al., 1979). In California, pollens from wind-pollinated tree species
(e.g., valley oak, <I>Quercus lobata </I>Nee', Fagaceae) are available
as early as March (Munz, 1973), whereas annual and perennial grasses
produce pollen mainly during April and May. Pollens are attractive
foods (Zhimo and McMurtry, 1990), and, if excessively abundant,
might be expected to divert the predators from the target pests.
Of the grass pollens thus far tested, none is a sufficient diet
for E. <I>tularensis </I>to sustain peak reproductive rates for
more than one generation. The thick exine coats of grass pollens
may render them less suitable as foods than other pollens (e.g.,
apple pollen) (Ouyang et al., 1992).<BR>

<H3>Management Techniques</H3>

<P>
In California, legal and market pressures and the development
of pesticide-resistant pests are motivating farmers to explore
cover cropping as at least a partial alternative to insecticides
and acaricides. Californian orchardists are exploring the use
of cover crops to provide key resources for predators and parasites
of orchard pests, and to arrest generalist pests, such as <I>Lygus
</I>spp. and flower thrips <I>(Frankliniella </I>spp.).<BR>

<P>
The options being explored include the use of: 1) resident vegetation
that harbors abundant beneficial arthropods; 2) alternate strip
management of cover crops, including, planting, mowing, and tillage
schemes designed to ensure temporal continuity of habitat for
both beneficial and pest arthropods; 3) commercial &quot;insectary
mixes&quot; of plants that are attractive to beneficial arthropods;
4) mowing and deposition of clippings as mulch to harbor generalist
predators. The last-named option is poorly understood in orchard
systems.<BR>

<H3>Strip Management</H3>

<P>
The understory vegetation in an orchard need not be managed uniformly.
Different zones maybe treated differently; we term this &quot;strip
management,&quot; because the different treatments are usually
applied linearly, and the different understory zones appear as
bands or strips running through an orchard. Strip management of
cover crops may entail: 1) sowing cover crops of different floristic
composition in different strips; 2) mowing strips at different
times; 3) tilling strips at different times; and 4) combinations
of 1,2, and 3. Sowing of different mixes leads to stands with
differing statures and phenologies, affording diverse resources
to pest and beneficial arthropods. A complex of stands having
differing floristic compositions could remain attractive to arthropods
for longer periods of time. Paradoxically, mowing can be used
either to kill or to rejuvenate a cover crop. Close mowing of
annual cover crops in full flower may kill the cover crop. Plant
species having indeterminate growth habits can be mowed relatively
high and before peak blossoming to extend attractiveness to both
beneficial and pest arthropods. High mowing preserves vegetative
and flower buds and permits regrowth of many species. By contrast,
tillage usually destroys cover crops.<BR>

<P>
Strip management can permit a grower to attain multiple goals
and balance competing aims, such as reducing competition from
the cover crop or liberating nutrients for the trees, while maintaining
habitat or allowing cover crops to reseed. Byway of illustration,
a walnut orchardist in northern California (R. Lester, Winters,
California) mows or tills strips of woollypod vetch <I>(Vicia
villosa </I>Roth ssp. <I>dasycarpa </I>Ten., cv 'Lana') and common
vetch <I>(Vicia sativa </I>L.), while leaving alternating remnant
strips to reseed the entire alley. After seed of vetches has matured
in May, flowering will resume if soil moisture is sufficient.
Thus, arthropod habitat can be retained through time.<BR>

<P>
A prune grower (T. Turkovich, Winters, California) sowed alternating
alleys to different mixtures. One set of alleys received a mixture
of woollypod vetch, common vetch, and oat <I>(Avena sativa </I>L.).
The other set of alleys was seeded to a mixture of crimson clover
<I>(Trifolium incarnatum </I>L.), rose clover <I>(Trifolium hirtum
</I>All.), subterranean clovers <I>(Trifolium subterraneum </I>L.),
barrel medic <I>(Medicago truncatula </I>Gaertn., cv 'Jemmalong'),
rattail fescue <I>(Vulpia myuros </I>L., cv 'Zorro'), and soft
chess <I>(Bromus mollis </I>L., cv 'Blando'). At two-week intervals
beginning in late June, every third alley is mowed high. Thus,
maturation of seed is permitted, cover crop regrowth (1)y vetches
only) is staggered, and resident warm-season vegetation gradually
supplants the cool-season annual complexes. Beneficial insects,
such as lady beetles, ants, and parasitic Hymenoptera persist
in the understory under this regime (R.L. Bugg, pers. obs.). Outbreaks
of two-spotted spider mite <I>(Tetranychus urticae </I>Koch, Acari:
Tetranychidae) have been avoided since 1991, when this scheme
was adopted. Prior to this, in the spring of 1990, cover crops
were mowed closely throughout the orchard, and a spider mite outbreak
ensued, necessitating an application of acaricide.<BR>

<H3>Insectary Mixes</H3>

<P>
Proprietary mixes of reputed &quot;insectary crops&quot; are now
commercially available from several sources. Several of the plants
in these mixes are known to attract beneficial arthropods of interest
to orchardists; others have not been assessed formally. Few have
been evaluated in critical experiments on orchard biological control.
The authors suggested that most of the plants employed attract
wide ranges of entomophagous arthropods, and that increasing numbers
of farmers are using insectary cover crops.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
Various cover crops harbor distinctive complexes of beneficial
and pest arthropods, and diverse trophic relationships have been
well documented in the literature. More study is required to determine:
1) whether cover cropping modifies orchard microclimate and target-crop
nutritional status, thereby influencing pest dynamics; and 2)
whether and how cover crop species composition, spatial interspersion
of species, and management (irrigation, mowing, and tillage) affect
build-up and movement of arthropods, and resultant pest damage
to the target crop. Formal replicated trials are essential to
evaluate these issues in the context of overall orchard management.

Adapted from UC SAREP Progress Report 1993-1995. UC Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Program, Davis, CA. 1996<BR>

<P>
<I>Editor's note: This research summary is based in part on a
series of articles featured in California Agriculture, Volume
48, Number 5, 1994, University of California, Division of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, Oakland, CA. The project is supported primarily
by the USDA's Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
(SARE) program and UC SAREP. Additional funds have also come from
the California Department of Food and Agriculture's Fertilizer
Research and Education Program and the H.J. Heinz Foundation.</I>
<P>
This review summarizes some of the latest information coming out
of a long-term research project at the University of California,
Davis. The project, now entering its ninth year of operation,
has been set up to describe and quantify the environmental, agronomic
and economic consequences of the transition from conventional
farming systems to systems that are less dependent on synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides. The focus is on cropping systems typical
of the southern Sacramento Valley in California. The research
team is multidisciplinary, and participating farmers and UC Cooperative
Extension farm advisors play a key role in guiding the management
decisions applied to the various production systems. By broadening
and integrating the scope of investigation, researchers have been
able to critically evaluate the success of different farming practices
and their effects on the environment, as well as the special requirements
for adapting alternative practices to farms in other locations.
<H3>Rotations and Experimental Design</H3>

<P>
The project was initiated in 1988, and is located on 28 acres
at the UC Davis Agronomy Farm. The main experiment occupies about
20 acres and compares four cropping systems: 1) a conventional
two-year rotation; 2) a conventional four-year rotation; 3) a
low-input four-year rotation; and 4) an organic four-year rotation.
The four systems are arranged in a split-plot design with four
replicates of each system. All the cropping systems include processing
tomatoes, a high-value commodity grown on approximately 310,000
acres in California (1990 data). Other cash crops grown include
wheat, safflower, field corn, and beans. In addition, winter-spring
cover crops are grown in the low-input and organic systems. The
specific rotations used in the different management systems are
shown in Table 1. Each replicate of the four systems started the
rotation in 1989 with a different entry point in the sequence
of crops.
<H3>Observations and Results</H3>

<P>
Researchers have been collecting data on: crop growth, yield and
quality; soil biology; soil fertility; soil organic matter levels;
soil water infiltration rates; weeds, pest and beneficial insect
populations and disease levels; and economic performance. Some
of the key findings and questions for future research are summarized
below.
<P>
<B>Crop growth and yield.</B> Soil fertility and weed management
have been identified as the most important factors limiting yields
in the organic and low-input systems. Project managers have altered
production practices to address these constraints. Organic and
low-input tomatoes, for example, are now transplanted instead
of direct seeded. This practice leaves more time for cover crop
growth, gives tomatoes a head start in competing against weeds
and allows for the use of efficient mechanical cultivation techniques.
Manure fertilizers and foliar sprays have also improved yields
in the organic systems. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to
obtain the high quality transplants necessary for optimal growth
and yield. In the 1994 growing season, for example, researchers
found that transplants in the organic and low-input systems were
infected with a virus. Symptoms became apparent four to six weeks
after transplanting, and yields in the organic and low-input systems
were lower than in the conventional systems.
<P>
<B>Soil biology and fertility.</B> Nitrogen availability appears
to be an important factor determining tomato yields during the
transition to organic production. Prior to 1992, tomato plants
in the organic system were stunted and yellow early in the season,
did not compete well with weeds, and had yields lower than tomatoes
grown under conventional methods. These results were despite the
fact that soil nitrate levels in the organic tomatoes in 1990
and 1991 were actually higher than or equivalent to levels in
the conventional system. The reason for this phenomenon is probably
related to the importance of microbial activity in an organic
system. Unlike the conventional system where plants obtain nutrients
from highly soluble chemical sources, the organic and low-input
systems rely on microorganisms to make nutrients available for
plant uptake. Through the first four years of the rotation, it
has been determined that the low-input and organic systems derived
85 percent of their nitrogen from the vetch cover crop that was
incorporated into the soil and broken down by microbes.<BR>

To measure the importance of soil microbial activity, researchers
looked closely at changes in microbial biomass carbon over the
growing season. Microbial biomass carbon is an estimate of both
the size of the total microbial community and the mass of potential
plant nutrients contained within the cells of the microorganisms.
This variable was measured in tomato plots four times between
March and September in both 1990 and 1992. Levels of microbial
biomass carbon fluctuated similarly in all systems over the growing
season. In 1990 the only significant differences among the four
farming systems occurred following the early April incorporation
of the cover crop, at which time the microbial biomass carbon
was higher in the organic and low-input systems. In 1992 microbial
biomass carbon was higher in the organic and low-input systems
throughout the growing season.
<P>
Related studies have shown some interesting differences in nematode
populations among the four farming systems. Nematodes can be classified
by what they feed on: bacteria, fungi, plants, or other nematodes.
In the two conventional systems, the total numbers of all nematodes
in the soil (to 30 cm depth) did not change significantly between
1988 and 1992. In contrast, during the same period, there were
significant decreases in the total number of nematodes in the
low-input and organic systems. Bacterial feeding nematodes are
of particular interest because of their role in mineralizing nitrogen.
Thirteen of these species have been identified in this research
site. The proportion of all nematodes that are bacterial feeders
declined over the four years in the two conventional systems,
increased in the low-input system and declined in the organic
system. The decline in the organic system is surprising given
the high levels of microbial biomass measured in those plots.
Researchers suggest that the late sampling date for nematodes
may have been responsible for this discrepancy.

<B>Insects, Weeds and Diseases.</B> The shift from conventional
to low-input or organic pest control did not result in large increases
in relative abundance of most pest species over the period of
this study. However, there were some significant short-term problems
in individual farming systems. Significantly greater damage occurred
in organic and low-input plots due to tomato fruitworm in 1989
and stink bugs in 1992, while insecticides prevented damage to
conventional plots. Similarly, the cover crop residue appeared
to increase damage by seed corn maggot to safflower and corn in
two consecutive years. Verticillium increased in soils on the
conventional two-year plots, probably because of the increased
frequency of tomato plantings in this system. The presence of
the disease organism, however, does not seem to have affected
yields in those plots. Bacterial spot of processing tomato was
severe in the spring of 1993, due to rain and a hailstorm. Aerial
treatments were not practical for the small plots in this study,
but by the time the fields had dried sufficiently for ground application,
the weather was hot and dry, stopping the epidemic. Rust occurred
every year on all safflower plots. However, it was not observed
to cause yield loss. Corn smut was observed in all plots, but
the level of its incidence remained below the treatment threshold.
<P>
Weeds were a problem in all systems, but the different control
methods employed in each system favored the growth of several
key species. In the low-input and organic systems, barnyardgrass
has become a significant problem. In the conventional systems,
field bindweed and nightshade have been more problematic. The
shift to these weed species has resulted in modifications to the
control strategies, including herbicide changes or increased cultivation
frequency, but there has been little or no change in total weed
cover. The vagaries of the weather presented an added challenge
in low-input and organic systems. For example, the wet spring
in 1993 prevented timely cultivation and resulted in increased
weed competition in the organic corn where herbicides were not
used.
<P>
Economics. Results to date suggest that similar crop yields may
be obtained when &quot;best farmer&quot; management practices
are used in each of the different systems. Similar yields, however,
do not necessarily translate into similar profits. The yields
and organic price premiums of tomatoes, and year-to-year variation
in production costs for each system were the most important factors
determining relative whole-farm profit (Figure 1). During the
1991 growing season, for example, gross returns, per acre operating
costs, and net returns above total costs were all highest in the
conventional two-year rotation (all crops combined). The 1992
season, by contrast, showed that the organic systems had the highest
figures in each of these same categories. Reduced whole-farm profits
per acre in the 1993 and 1994 seasons can be attributed to problems
with tomato transplants as described earlier.
<P>
Results of this study support what other studies have found: The
transition period (as evidenced by the performance of the low-input
system) carries significant risk. There are no price premiums
for &quot;transitional commodities,&quot; costs of production
may be high, growers are generally on the steep part of the learning
curve, and the new production system can be ecologically unstable
for a time.
<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
From the standpoint of crop performance and yield, it appears
that a rotation of processing tomatoes, safflower, field corn
and wheat or winter legume, followed by double-cropped dry beans,
is a good crop rotation on which to make systems comparisons.
The use of nitrogen-fixing winter cover crops for green manure
and as seed crops has merit, but also resulted in crop management
challenges that required &quot;best farmer&quot; experience and
flexibility to work within the constraints imposed by time and
weather. The late winter, early spring management of cover crops,
including residue management, seedbed preparation, supplemental
manuring and the retention of sufficient soil moisture to germinate
tomatoes, corn and safflower has become a central research theme
for continuing studies in the large companion plots adjacent to
the main experiment. The interdisciplinary group is focusing on
several key issues as the project continues its second rotation
cycle. These include identifying the best cover crops for each
system/season combination and observing phenomena that have an
impact on soil fertility and plant nutrition, particularly the
season-long monitoring of cover crop nitrogen, crop growth and
yield. The long-term implications of weed control, as well as
the related demand for creative management and appropriate equipment,
are critical.
<P>
Conclusions about the preferable crop with which to enter the
rotation are still premature. The attractive premiums offered
for organically grown tomatoes, and regulations that specify a
minimum of three years without pesticides prior to certification,
suggest that field corn would be the best starting point of the
rotation, but pest control (and especially weed management) implications
of this choice must be considered. Choices will also depend on
the grower's economic situation and a consideration of the wide
range of costs and returns for the five cash crops in the rotation.
The challenges of managing winter cover and grain legume cash
crops without herbicides (organic), or with short-lived, post-emergence
herbicides (low-input), are at least partially offset by the opportunities
to plant or replant catch crops, such as spring barley after lupine
and pink beans after safflower in this study.

<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation is offering funds for
organic farming methods research, dissemination of research results
to organic farmers, and growers interested in making the transition
to organic production systems, and education of the public about
organic farming issues. Projects should involve farmers in both
design and execution, and take place on working farms whenever
possible and appropriate. Proposals of $3,000-$5,000 are encouraged.
Most projects will be less than $10,000. Matching funds from other
sources and/or in-kind contributions from cooperators are encouraged
but not required. Proposals are considered twice a year. The next
round of proposals must be received by July 31,1994. To receive
copies of grant application procedures and the &quot;OFRF Research
and Education Priorities&quot; which describes target areas. write

<H3>'Train the Trainers' Grants<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Two Calls for Proposals aimed at educational institutions, nonprofit
groups and farmers are expected to be released soon from the USDA-sponsored
Western Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
(SARE) program. Individuals, groups and educators are being sought
to help the Cooperative Extension Service train its agents in
sustainable agriculture. The 1990 Farm Bill mandated that Extension
Service and other USDA agency personnel increase their understanding
and proficiency in sustainable agriculture; in 1993, for the first
time, Congress approved funding for this provision. The $2.96
million allocated will establish training programs in each of
the four USDA SARE regions. In the Western region, two CFPs will
be released shortly: one for a regional coordinator of an envisioned
educational network/consortium, and another for potential training
projects. Development and oversight of the educational training
&quot;network,&quot; including the selection of the coordinator,
will be handled by the current Western SARE administrative council
and staff. Interested individuals and groups should contact the
Western Region SARE office in Oakland at (510) 987-9862 to get
on the mailing list for the expected CFPs. <BR>

<DD>Seeds germinate epigeally (on the soil surface).  First leaves above cotyledons are simple and opposite; subsequent trifoliate leaves are alternate (Duke, 1981).  Seedlings have large leaves and quickly provide a canopy (Miller et al., 1989).<P>

<DD>Seed is abundant (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed 39 types of plant-parasitic nematodes that can infest cowpea.  Cv 'Iron' reduced soybean nematodes in a greenhouse experiment (Rodriguez-Kabana et al., 1988).  In a greenhouse pot survey of various warm-season legumes, cowpea was particularly effective in reducing rootknot nematodes (<I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B> and <I>M.  incognita</I></B>) and soybean cyst nematode (<I>Heterodera glycines</I></B> race 4) (Rodriguez-Kabana, 1988).<P> Rhoades (1983) found that sting nematode was moderately abundant following cover cropping with cowpea ('California Blackeye No. 5'). In two out of three years, yield of cabbage was not thereafter reduced below that obtained using the nematicide fenamiphos. Rootknot nematode, <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B>, failed to develop high densities on any of the cover crops, but was particularly abundant on vegetables following sesbania and cowpea.<P> McKenry (pers. comm.) noted that 'Blackeye 5' was resistant to <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B> and that 'Magnolia' was resistant to <I>M. incognita</I></B> and <I>M.  javonica</I></B>.<P> All cultivars host <I>Protylenchus scribneri</I></B>, but this is not a problem for trees and vines (UC 4045, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Cowpea was better than rice, maize, or pigeon pea for reducing soil loss from 2 percent slopes (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Common names include cowpea (Duke, 1981; Miller, 1988; Yost and Evans, 1988), blackeye bean (Miller, 1988), blackeye pea (Miller et al., 1989), blackeyed pea (Duke, 1981), crowder pea (Duke, 1981), and southern pea (Duke, 1981).<P>

<DD><I>Vigna unguiculata</I></B> (L.) Walpers ssp. <I>unguiculata</I></B> (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Cowpea is stated as tolerant of moderate shade (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988) but subject to mildew in heavy shade (McLeod, 1982).<P> In Costa Rica, Bazill (1987) reported that tropical legumes showing good shade tolerance in the understory of <I>Pinus caribaea</I></B> var <I>hondurensis</I></B> were <I>Centrosema brasilianum</I></B> (L.)

Urb., <I>Canavaglia ensiformis</I></B> (L.) DC, <I>Lablab purpureus</I></B> (L.) Sweet, and <I>Vigna unguiculata</I></B> (L. Walp.).  On the other hand, performing poorly were <I>Indigofera hirsuta</I></B> L., <I>Cajanus cajan</I></B> (L.) Millsp., and <I>Stizolobium</I></B> sp.  No quantitative data were given in support of these conclusions.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Seeds can be eaten fresh or dried for storage; leaves can be eaten as a vegetable, or used for forage or silage; and plants can be incorporated as green manure.  Indeterminate cvs are best for subsistence farming, whereas erect, determinate forms are more suitable for commercial farming in monocultural systems (Duke, 1981; see McLeod, 1982).<P> Cowpea is a heat-adapted legume that will make maximum growth during short summer periods before late-summer or fall-planted crops (Miller, 1988).  It is also suitable for summer legume cover in orchards and vineyards or undersown with corn (Peaceful Valley, 1988).  To prepare poor soil before sowing a crimson clover crop, turn under two successive cowpea crops (McLeod, 1982).<P> Cultivars with spreading habit and luxuriant growth have been widely used as green manures.  Cowpea is a promising multipurpose legume in cropping systems (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P> Cowpea is useful for suppressing weeds; a thick stand will smother bermudagrass (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P> Cowpea can follow crops such as early sweet corn and early processing tomatoes, and precede fall-planted crops such as vegetable brassicas and cereal grains (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Cowpea is subject to mildew in heavy shade (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Cowpea is an annual herb, erect or suberect and stems usually procumbent (Duke, 1981).  In a solid stand, plants form a viny canopy 2' high (Miller, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Mean heights (+/- S.E.M.) obtained in replicated (r=5) monocultural plots in a mature pecan orchard in Tifton, Georgia, September 1, 1988, were for the following varieties, in cm (inches in parentheses): 'Calhoun': 48.40 +/- 4.57 (19.10 +/- 1.80); 'Chinese Red': 52.85 +/- 3.09 (20.81 +/- 1.22); 'Iron-Clay': 60.70 +/- 2.08(23.90 +/- 0.82); and 'Red Ripper': 47.95 +/- 0.80 (18.88 +/- 0.31) (P=0.0051, Fisher's Protected Least Significant Difference = 6.797 cm or 2.676 inches) (Bugg, unpublished data). These measurements show varietal differences in height but relate well to the 2 feet (60.96 cm) given by several authors (Miller, 1988; Peaceful Valley, 1988; Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Cowpea or varieties thereof are said to tolerate weeds (Duke, 1981).  The more vigorous varieties of cowpea can compete with grass weeds; for example, where bermudagrass does not produce seed, it can be controlled by first plowing it under, then growing a thickly sown and strong growing crop such as cowpeas (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Likewise, the dense canopy will shade out any in-row weeds when cowpea is sown agronomically (Miller et al., 1989).<P> In a study by Bugg and Dutcher (1989), "combine" or "reseeding" cowpea sown in early July in a mature pecan orchard (which included bahia and bermuda grasses in the understory) apparently conferred more rapid vegetational cover and better reduction of weed cover than did other warm-season legumes (lespedeza, American jointvetch, sesbania, or alyceclover).  No inferential statistics on legume or weed cover were presented in this replicated study, but means were plotted through time.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Cowpea tolerates annual mean temperatures of from 12.5-27.8 degrees C, with the mean of 54 cases being 22.1 (Duke, 1981); the species is cold sensitive and killed by frost (Duke, 1981; Miller, 1989).  Cowpea is more sensitive to frost than is soybean (McLeod, 1982).  The most productive heat-adapted legume (Miller et al., 1988, 1989), cowpea is adapted to almost the same hot, moist climatic conditions as corn although it requires more heat (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Cowpea tolerates from 2.8 to 41.0 dm of precipitation (11-161.42 inches), with the mean of 54 cases being 14.2 (55.91 inches); cowpea is usually grown under rainfed rather than irrigated conditions (Duke, 1981).  Cowpea is regarded as fairly drought resistant (Peaceful Valley, 1988), slightly more so than soybean (McLeod, 1982), with a taproot that can explore deep soil profiles for moisture (Miller, 1988).  However, most of the moisture used is obtained from the surface foot of soil (McLeod, 1982).  A cover crop can be obtained in 60-90 days with very little irrigation (Miller, 1988).  Cowpea is less tolerant of waterlogging than is soybean (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) mentioned that early-maturing varieties produce mature seed in 90 days; late varieties may require 240 days.  Pods ripen unevenly, with green and ripe pods occurring at the same time; harvest of seed usually occurs when 1/2 to 2/3 of seed are ripe.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), the taproot is stout with laterals near the surface; nodules are large.  The root system is more extensive than those of soybean or moth bean (McLeod, 1982), and it can explore deep soil profiles for moisture (Miller, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Cowpea tolerates soil pH of from 4.3-7.9, with the mean of 46 cases being 6.2; cowpea or varieties thereof are said to be tolerant of low pH and high pH but in general are less tolerant of alkaline conditions (Duke, 1981).  It is said to thrive in low-fertility soil if pH is between 5.5 and 6.5 (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988)<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Cowpea is chiefly a summer annual (McLeod, 1982; Miller, 1988; Miller et al., 1989) that grows rapidly during short 60 to 90 day summer growing periods (Miller et al., 1989).  Some varieties are indeterminate, and where not frost killed may behave as weak perennials (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed is relatively inexpensive (Miller et al., 1989).  Quotes included $1.25/lb or $41.00/50# bag raw seed (Peaceful Valley, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sow after the last threat of frost (Duke, 1981), or when soil is thoroughly warmed and the weather settled (McLeod, 1982).  Mid or late summer sowings are often used for green manure (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) mentioned that cowpea can be grown in polycultures with cassava, corn, sorghum, sudangrass, johnsongrass, millets, peanuts, or soybeans.<P> De Queiroz and Galwey (1987) tested five sorghum (S1006, 2219 B, CSH 5, CSH 6, and Ethiopian landrace E 35-1) and 2 cowpea varieties (the semi-erect C 152 and the spreading, later-maturing GFC 4) planted as sole crops and in sorghum- cowpea bicultures during the dry season.  There was no significant effect of cowpea variety on sorghum yield, nor of sorghum variety on cowpea.  This will probably not be the case for rainy-season plantings, in which sorghum tends to shade the intercrop more completely.  For dry-season plantings, the authors suggest that a single cowpea variety might be used to evaluate sorghum performance in biculture.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Stinkbugs (Pentatomidae) and leaffooted bug (Coreidae) can build up on cowpea; cowpea should not be used as cover crop in pecan orchards because these insects can disperse from the cover crop and damage the nuts (Dutcher and Todd, 1983).  McLeod (1982) mentioned that a so-called squash bug attacks both the cowpeas and the producing pecans, so cowpeas cannot be used as green manure after pecan trees begin producing nuts.  It is more likely that stink bugs were again the culprits (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In southern Georgia, extrafloral nectaries of cowpea attracted 26 types of wasps, including 6 types of Vespidae, 4 Pompilidae, 10 Sphecidae, 3 Tiphiidae, and one each of Chrysididae, Scoliidae, and Ichneumonidae (Bugg, unpublished data).  In California, various predatory and parasitic wasps are often seen at the nectaries, as are predatory lady beetles, <I>Collops vittatus</I></B> (striped flower beetle), various bigyed bugs (<I>Geocoris</I></B> spp.), and the pest, 11-spotted cucumber beetle (<I>Diabrotica undecimpunctata</I></B>) (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In India, Natarajan and Sheshadri (1988) assessed cotton (cv MCU 5 VT) for effect of intercropping on densities of aphid (<I>Aphis gossypii</I></B> Glover), leafhopper (<I>Amrasca devastans</I></B> Distant), bollworms (<I>Earias insulana</I></B> Boisduval and <I>E. vittella</I></B> [Fabricius]), entomophagous lady beetles (Coccinellidae) (<I>Melanochilus sexmaculatus</I></B> Fabricius and <I>Coccinella</I></B> sp.), and braconid wasps (<I>Rogas aligarhensis</I></B> Qadri and <I>Agathis fabiae</I></B> Nixon) that attack bollworms.  Cotton was grown in a replicated trial under four intercropping regimes: (1) cotton and cowpea (cv Co.Vu.623); (2) cotton and soybean (cv Co.1); (3) cotton and country onion; and (4) cotton alone.  The second factor was insecticidal application, assigned by a split-plot approach.  No effects were observed on aphid and leafhopper populations, nor on bollworms.  The latter occurred at generally low densities.  Parasitism of bollworms by the braconids was higher in the cotton + soybean and the cotton + cowpea treatments.  The cotton + cowpea system showed elevated densities of the coccinellids.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Based on yields of pods and seeds, cowpea (cv 'California Buckeye No.  5') was most sensitive to salinity during the vegetative stage and became less so through the flowering and pod-filling stages.  Seed yields were depressed 50% at osmotic potentials of -0.45, -0.76, and -0.88 MPa for vegetative, flowering, and pod-filling stages respectively (Mass and Poss, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>In Davis, Yolo County, California, Klein (1990) obtained the following above-ground biomass yields (dry matter in kg/ha, mean +/- SEM): 'California Blackeye #46,' 4,461.4+/-375.2; 'California Blackeye #3,' 4,777.6+/-324.1; 'Chinese Red,' 3,828.8+185.4; 'Spotted Purple Hull,' 3,912.0+/-420.2.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that cowpea does well on many types of soil from highly-acid to neutral but is less tolerant of alkaline conditions.  Although adapted to a wide range of soil types, including low-fertility soils, best growth occurs on sandy loams, and for optimum growth, good drainage, aeration and water supply are important (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988).  Miller et al. (1989) stated that best growth is made on deep well-drained acid to neutral soils.  Cowpea is sensitive to excess amounts of boron (Agbenin, Lombin, and Owonubi, 1990).  This species is thought to be better than clover or alfalfa on thin soils or soils low in lime and those too poor and acid for clover (McLeod, 1982).  For grain production, a poor soil is actually better because a poor soil produces little vegetation and ample seed, whereas a rich soil leads to abundant vegetative growth and little seed (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>There are great differences among cultivars in environmental tolerances, and some 7,000 cv accessions were housed at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, as of 1975 (Duke, 1981).  Forty-six commercial varieties were listed in the 1990-91 (41st) Edition of the Southern Seedsmen's Association (S.S.A.) Directory and Buyers' Guide (Bugg., pers. comm.).<P> The cowpea variety Ife BPC had yields equal to those of two other varieties tested (Ife Brown and AFB 1757) but contributed a net positive of 30.3 kg N/ha to the soil (from N contained in vegetative structures) whereas other varieties showed a net deficit.  Although there was evidence that uninoculated cowpea was heavily nodulated, inoculated Ife BPC had better N content in vegetative structures (Awonaike et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>The appropriate rhizobial inoculant type is "EL" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez.  1980; Nitragin Company, Inc., No Date; Duke, 1981).  EL type rhizobia can persist for several years in the soil, so the first crop of cowpeas in an area may require inoculation, but subsequent crops may not (see McLeod, 1982).<P> The cowpea variety Ife BPC had yields equal to those of two other varieties tested ((Ife Brown and AFB 1757) but contributed a net positive of 30.3 kg N/ha to the soil (from N contained in vegetative structures) whereas other varieties showed a net deficit.  Although there was evidence that uninoculated cowpea was heavily nodulated, inoculated Ife BPC had greater N content in vegetative structures (Awonaike et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that cowpea above-ground N content ranges globally from 73-354 kg/ha, with a mean of 198 kg/ha.  Peaceful Valley (1988) estimated only as much as 80 lb/acre.  In Davis, California, Klein (1990) found the following nitrogen contents (in kg N/ha, mean +/- SEM): 'California Blackeye # 46, 151.4+/-13.0; 'California Blackeye #3, 152.8+/-3.8; 'Chinese Red,' 142.5+/- 13.7; 'Spotted Purple Hull,' 146.2+/-13.1 kg/ha nitrogen (Mean+/-SEM).<P> At plowdown, available N from cover crops can be estimated by multiplying harvested fresh weight of cover crop from a sixteen square feet (4 x 4 ft.) sample plot by 12 (to estimate lbs of N/acre) (Miller et al.  1989).<P> The cowpea variety Ife BPC had yields equal to those of two other varieties tested ((Ife Brown and AFB 1757) but contributed a net positive of 30.3 kg N/ha to the soil (from N contained in vegetative structures), whereas other varieties showed a net deficit.  Although there was evidence that uninoculated cowpea was heavily nodulated, inoculated Ife BPC had better N content in vegetative structures (Awonaike et al., 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>As green manure, cowpea is sometimes rolled down before being turned under (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds 2-12 mm long, globular to reniform, smooth or wrinkled, red, black, brown, green buff, or white as dominant color; full colored, spotted, marbled, speckled, eyed, or blotched; (5-30 g/100 seeds) (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No specific information available on tolerance to herbicides. According to Duke's (1981) review, in cowpea culture, amines of 2,4-D and MCPA are used as preemergence sprays; trifluralin before sowing also gives good weed control.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that cowpea is a short-day plant, and listed flowering as occurring in early summer, but flowering occurs at greatly varying times for different varieties (Bugg, pers. comm.). In southern Georgia, Bugg (unpublished data) sowed several cultivars of cowpea on June 7 and 8 in a pecan orchard, and weekly inspection indicated that the varieties 'Calhoun,' 'Chinese Red,' and 'Red Ripper' all were vegetative on August 11 but attained flower by August 18; cv 'Iron Clay' flowered later. In Massachusetts, cv 'Mississippi Silver' sown on May 7 reached peak flowering on August 7 (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).  In southern Georgia, "combine" or "reseeding" cowpea sown on July 3-4 began flowering in early August (Bugg and Dutcher, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Seed after frost danger is past, plant in rows or broadcast; germination is epigeal (Duke, 1981), i.e., occurs on the soil surface.  The species is said to tolerate aluminum, drought, high and low pH, heat, laterite, nematodes, poor soil, shade, slope, virus, weeds, and wilt (Duke, 1981).  For a 60-day green manure crop in the California Central Valley, seed into moisture and apply one irrigation thereafter (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>For a 60-day green manure crop in the California Central Valley, seed into moisture and apply one irrigation thereafter (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.).  Cowpea tolerates moderate shade, but not waterlogging (Duke, 1981).  Cowpea should not be used as a cover crop in flood-irrigated orchards (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>No specific information is available.  Viny varieties like 'Chinese Red' or 'Red Ripper' are probably not so easily mowed as erect cultivars like "combine" or "reseeding" cowpea (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Ordinary mowers may be used to harvest cowpea (Duke, 1981)<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>When harvested for seed, cut crop when 1/2-2/3 of seed are ripe. Self-rake reapers or special harvesters may be used.  For hay, cut when most pods are fully formed and the first have ripened. Ordinary mowers may be used with cowpea (Duke, 1981)<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Seeded cowpeas may be incorporated using disk harrow or cultipacker (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Self-rake reapers or special harvesters may be used.  For hay, cut when most pods are fully formed and the first have ripened (Duke, 1981). Ordinary mowers may be used with cowpea (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Cowpea requires less water than sesbania (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Cowpea may be used as pasture for hogs or used in mixture with corn or sorghum for silage (Duke, 1981)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Mark Van Horn (pers. comm.) reported that red-seeded cowpea varieties appear less palatable to ground squirrels do the pale California blackeye cultivars.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>The species has been cultured from ancient times in Africa and Asia and is now widespread throughout the tropics and subtropics. It originated near Ethiopia and subsequently was developed mainly in the farms of the African Savannah.  It is assigned to the African and Hindustani Centers of Diversity and is adapted to the Warm Temperate Thorn to Moist through Tropical Thorn to Wet Forest Life Zones (Duke, 1981).  Cowpea cannot be grown for grain as far north as soybean because cowpea is more sensitive to frost (McLeod, 1982). The species was at one time used extensively as a green manure in northern Queensland, Australia; it has also been used in the southern United States, Nigeria, Rhodesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and elsewhere (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Cowpea or varieties thereof are said to be tolerant of aluminum, high pH, low pH, laterite, and poor soil.  Although cowpea does well on poor soil, it often responds favorably to added P, and it responds slightly to K up to an application rate of 45 kg/ha (Duke, 1981).  Cowpea has a low lime requirement (McLeod, 1982) but appears particularly intolerant of excess amounts of boron (Agbenin, Lombin, and Owonubi, 1990).<P> There was a non-significant increase in cowpea grain yield up to a nitrogen application rate of 30 kg/ha (Agbenin, Lombin, and Owonubi, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>In the U.S., seed production averages 1,000-1,500 kg/ha, but in California, up to 3,000 kg/ha; seed may be harvested when 1/2 to 2/3 of seed are ripe, using a special harvester, a self-rake reaper, or an ordinary mowing machine (Duke, 1981).  In poor soil, plants produce little vegetation and ample seed, whereas a rich soil produces abundant vegetation and little seed (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Recommended seeding rates include: 10-40 kg/ha if sown in rows or 90 kg/ha if broadcast (Duke, 1981); 90 lb/acre if broadcast (McLeod, 1982; Peaceful Valley, 1988); 30 lb/acre (Miller, 1988); and 30 to 50 lbs/acre (Miller et al. 1989).<P> A recommended spacing for a grain crop is 3 feet between rows, with 2-3 inches between plants, at a rate of 30-40 lb/acre (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Seeding depth should be 1/2-1 inch, or deeper in sandy soil (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Cowpea seed can remain viable in storage for several years, according to Duke (1981), but McLeod (1982) wrote that it remains viable for a relatively short time.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reports that cowpea is an annual herb, erect or suberect and spreading, reaching 80 cm or more in height.  Foliage is glabrous.  Taproot is stout with laterals near surface; nodules are large.<P>

Article written for Sustainable Agriculture Technical Reviews.
1995
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Managing cover crops in orchards or vineyards depends in part
on understanding their basic biology. This article, presented
in two parts, reviews several aspects of cover crop biology. Part
I (see <I>Sustainable Agriculture</I>, Vol. 7, No. 4, p. 15) dealt
with seeds, seedlings, root-zone biology, nutrient uptake, and
the fate of cover crop-derived nitrogen. Part II presented here
concerns plant community dynamics and allelopathy. Most of the
plant species discussed may be used as cover crops or as forage
crops in rangeland settings. The issues raised have general applicability
to a number of farming systems in California.
<H3>Yields and Competition in Multispecies Stands</H3>

<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Sb 1Stone Serif Semibold">Cover Crops and Trees
or Vines<BR>
</FONT></B>Wick and Alleweldt (1983) showed that, when grown together
in containers, subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterranean</I>
cv 'Clare') caused a 20 percent reduction in growth of Riesling
grape vines. The mechanism for this inhibition was not known,
and it occurred regardless of the level of nitrogen fertilization.
No such inhibitory effect was seen for subterranean clover cv
'Daliak' or for white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I>). The legumes
supplied nitrogen to the vines when only low amounts of nitrogen
were added, and there was higher use of water by vines with legumes.
When grown in a young vineyard, 'Daliak' showed more rapid early
growth than white clover, but was damaged by frost and did not
reseed. 
<P>
In Arkansas, Stasiak (1990) planted peach trees of two scion and
two rootstock types into either bare ground or preestablished
stands of subterranean clover in the tree rows. With both bare
and clover plots, permanent drive middles were maintained in a
sod of mixed tall fescue and bermudagrass. Comparison indicated
that tree rows with preexisting subterranean clover led to reduced
peach tree vigor (shoot growth, trunk cross-sectional area, foliar
nitrogen content) during the first year of growth. By the second
year, this tendency was eliminated. Stasiak suggested planting
subterranean clover in August following the first season of peach
tree growth, rather than planting peach trees into preestablished
subterranean clover.
<P>
Orchardgrass (<I>Dactylis glomerata</I>, cv 'Berber'), a vigorous
perennial bunchgrass, when grown as a cover crop reduced vine
growth by 58 percent and yield by 53 percent of Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes in Santa Barbara County of California, although the site
featured highly fertile soil (Wolpert et al. 1993). This effect
was due at least in part to increased water stress of the vines.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Multiple Legumes<BR>
</B>Williams et al. (1968) showed that subterranean clover has,
on the average, larger seed than does crimson clover (<I>Trifolium
incarnatum</I>), and plot studies indicated that the former will
tend to dominate in mixtures due to more rapid early growth and
shading of the crimson clover. When larger seeds of crimson clover
were selected and interseeded with smaller seeds of subterranean
clover, the pattern was reversed. Crimson clover was not eliminated
from any of the mixtures evaluated.
<P>
Hill and Gleeson (1991) found that when paired with either 'Seaton
Park' or 'Daliak' subterranean clovers (both <I>Trifolium subterraneum</I>
ssp. subterranean) in a three-year field study, the cultivar 'Clare'
(<I>Trifolium subterranean</I> ssp. brachycalycinum) dominated
the mixed stands. Soil pH was about 5.5, mowing was once every
four weeks. Petiole length of 'Clare' is much greater than the
early-maturing 'Daliak,' and slightly greater than the mid-season
maturing 'Seaton Park.' 'Clare' also showed better seedling vigor
and survival and greater seed production per plant under stress.
Dry matter production by 'Clare' also is less dependent on plant
density. There was evidence of overyielding by mixtures of 'Clare'
and 'Seaton Park.' (Overyielding refers to the situation where
the yield of the polyculture exceeds the yield of its highest
yielding component grown in monoculture.) 'Clare' seed reserves
appeared to be more greatly reduced over the summer months than
those of 'Seaton Park' or 'Daliak'. <I>T. s.</I> ssp. brachycalycinum
is supposedly adapted to neutral to alkaline soils, and is believed
less tolerant to close grazing and less able to bury its burs
than is <I>T. subterraneum</I>.
<P>
Williams (1963) sowed crimson clover (strain S. Australian commercial),
rose clover (<I>Trifolium hirtum</I>, strain S.6), and subterranean
clover (cv 'Bacchus') in pure plantings and in three 1:1 mixtures
of two species each. Competition for light was assessed in relation
to leaf area and leaf position in the canopy. Leaf area in 4-cm
horizontal strata, leaf weight, shoot weight production, and light
penetration through canopies were measured at intervals during
the vegetative phase (i.e., through 99 days after sowing). Crimson
and rose clovers held apparent initial advantages over subterranean
clover, in terms of light-absorbing surface area of cotyledons
and first unifoliate leaves, and because these leaves were elevated
further from the soil surface. However, this situation changed
with time. In paired sowings, crimson and subterranean clover
became equally dominant over rose clover, while subterranean clover
overtopped crimson clover despite the greater total leaf area
of the latter. The most productive mixture (crimson clover + subterranean
clover) was no more productive than the best species in monoculture
(crimson clover). As noted by Williams (1963a), competition has
other dimensions than those reported here, including the advantage
conferred by hardseededness of rose clover, which enables it to
dominate multispecies stands following droughts that kill clover
seedlings.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes and Non-Leguminous Forbs<BR>
</B>Guerrero and Williams (1975) conducted several growth chamber
studies. In one study, Filaree (<I>Erodium botrys</I>) and subterranean
clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I> ssp. subterranean cv 'Woogenellup')
were grown in sole and mixed cultures in a phosphorus-deficient
range soil (from Butte County) and in sand with differing levels
of supplemental nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Filaree dominated
if phosphorus was limiting, whereas subterranean clover dominated
if nitrogen was left out of the fertilizer. Subterranean clover
has a higher requirement for phosphorus than does filaree, and
also appears less capable of exploiting insoluble phosphate sources.
For this reason, addition of superphosphate to rangeland soils
was suggested by the authors as a means of promoting subterranean
clover.
<P>
Moore et al. (1989) found in pot experiments in Australia that
subterranean clover can suppress the seedlings of the perennial
weed St. John's Wort (<I>Hypericum perforatum</I>) by overtopping
the seedlings and shading them out. This study confirmed earlier
findings that subterranean clover could suppress the weed if sown
into native pastures, particularly if phosphate fertilizers had
been applied. The importance of maintaining a closed canopy of
subterranean clover during the early phase of weed seedling growth
is emphasized.
<P>
<B>Legumes and Grasses<BR>
</B>Motazedian and Sharrow (1986) conducted a field study of stands
of subterranean clover and perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I>),
in which mowing height and frequency were varied. In stands dominated
by perennial ryegrass, greater stubble heights led to greater
productivity; the opposite was true for stands dominated by subterranean
clover. The greatest interval between defoliations (49 days) led
to the greatest productivity of the stands.
<P>
In the southwest portion of Western Australia, Cotterill (1990)
used unirrigated 35 x 35 cm plots to evaluate competition between
cool-season annual grasses and either 'Serena' bur medic or 'Seaton
Park' subterranean clover in a ley farming system (wheat-pasture
rotation). He found that dry matter production by the legumes
was depressed linearly with increasing seeding rates for various
cool-season annual grasses, including ripgut brome (<I>Bromus
diandrus</I>), wild barley (<I>Hordeum leporinum</I>), a ryegrass
(<I>Lolium rigidum</I>), and rattail fescue (<I>Vulpia myuros</I>).
Additionally, second-year legume biomass production was not significantly
depressed by grasses seeded the first year, as long as grass seeding
rates were less than 40 percent of the full rates. Full seeding
rates for grasses were over eight million seeds per hectare, while
those for the legumes were about two million seeds per hectare.
When seeded without grasses, the subterranean clover produced
the equivalent of 3.1 metric tons of biomass per hectare and the
bur medic about 1.5 metric tons per hectare. Pooled across all
levels of grasses, the corresponding results for subterranean
clover and bur medic were nearly identical at about 1 metric ton
per hectare.
<P>
In Austria, Danso et al. (1991) conducted a two-year trial in
a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (<I>Trifolium pratense</I>
cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I> cv
'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I> cv 'Tacuabe').
White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the
first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated. In the first
year, both legumes contributed about equally to the approximately
130 kg of nitrogen per hectare fixed in the sward. In the second
year, white clover only contributed five percent of the 46 kg
of nitrogen per hectare fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures
containing the two legumes have an advantage because the early
production by white clover is complemented by later production
and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil. Stands with multiple
legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legumes, Non-Leguminous Forbs, and a Grass<BR>
</B>Mohler and Liebman (1987) reported that high-density plantings
of barley were better at suppressing weeds than were intercropped
barley and field pea (<I>Pisum arvense</I>). Weed suppression
appeared to be a result of competition for soil moisture. Weed
populations were not reduced, but weed biomass was lower.
<P>
Liebman and Robichaux (1990) found that intercropped barley and
field pea  were no better at suppressing weed mustards (<I>Brassica
kaber</I>) and white mustard (<I>B. hirta</I>) than was a dense
monoculture of barley. The main mechanisms of weed suppression
were shading (especially by the pea) and competition for nitrogen
(especially by the barley). A long-vined variety of field pea
('Century') was better than a short-vined variety ('Alaska') at
suppressing mustard growth by shading. 'Century' also showed a
greater yield.<BR>

<P>
<B>Legume, Grass, and Various Herbs<BR>
</B>A four-year study in Maryland by Teasdale et al. (1991) suggested
that, under no-till management, hairy vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I>)
was particularly effective at reducing the densities of the following
weeds: goosegrass (<I>Eleusine indica</I>), stinkgrass (<I>Eragrostis
cilianensis</I>), and carpetweed (<I>Mollugo verticillata</I>).
Under conventional tillage, hairy vetch appeared during one year
to increase the densities of large crabgrass (<I>Digitaria sanguinalis</I>)
above those observed without a cover crop or with cereal rye (<I>Secale
cereale</I> cv 'Abruzzi'). In some years, cereal rye grown as
a no-till cover crop significantly reduced the densities of the
goosegrass and carpetweed. In one year, cereal rye managed with
tillage led to increased densities of common lambsquarters (<I>Chenopodium
album</I>).
<P>
Teasdale and Mohler (1993) in Maryland and New York State tested
the effects of mulching on light transmittance, soil temperature,
and soil moisture. The mulch in this study was the clipped residue
of herbicide-killed hairy vetch or cereal rye (cv 'Aroostook').
Data for light transmittance and soil temperature suggest that
cereal rye and hairy vetch residues have similar initial properties,
but that there is more rapid and thorough decomposition of hairy
vetch residue. Therefore, cereal rye provides a longer-lasting
mulch that blocks light and reduces soil temperature longer.
<P>
In a study encompassing two growing seasons at Beltsville, Maryland,
Teasdale and Daughtry (1993) showed that living hairy vetch was
more effective than standing, paraquat-killed vetch at suppressing
weed germination and growth. During droughty periods in both growing
seasons, soil moisture was significantly greater in the surface
2.5 cm of soil under living or dead hairy vetch, as contrasted
with bare soil. In one year of this study (1990), living vetch
led to significantly lower soil moisture than did killed vetch.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Grass and a Non-Leguminous Forbs<BR>
</B>Soft chess (<I>Bromus mollis</I>) suppresses broadleaf filaree
(<I>Erodium botrys</I>) by shading more effectively under conditions
of adequate sulfur (McCown and Williams 1968). When sulfur is
limited, broadleaf filaree accesses it sooner because of more
rapid extension of its young roots.<BR>

<P>
<B>Allelopathy</B>
<P>
Bialy et al. (1990) found that black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I>)
and brown mustard (<I>Brassica juncea</I>) show allelopathic inhibition
of other plants. Compounds involved probably include various isothiocyanates,
which suppressed wheat germination and growth.
<P>
Cereal rye produces several compounds that inhibit crops and weeds.
The most active compounds are two hydroxamic acids and their breakdown
products (Chase et al. 1991). Wocjcik-Wojtkowiak et al. (1990)
reported that residues of tillering plants and rye crop residues
contain much lower amounts of allelopathic compounds (various
phenolic acids) than do seedlings.
<P>
Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches)
contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into
soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound
(Schenk and Werner 1991). This chemical can cause reduced growth
in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce. Pea was only slightly
affected.

<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) regarded white clover as among the most nutritious and widely-used forage legumes, with a value difficult to estimate because of its tendency to volunteer; about half the irrigated or humid pasture in the U.S. contains some white clover.  It is usually grown in mixes with grasses, it makes excellent feed, pasture, hay, and silage for livestock and poultry.  Once established it serves excellently as a cover crop and in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion.  The latter point was confirmed by Miller (1984).<P> White clover is widely used as an irrigated pasture plant in California (Finch & Sharp, 1983) and is best adapted to rotational pasture management.  As a cover crop, it is suitable in orchards where a perennial ground cover can be maintained (Miller, 1988) and in vineyards of the same description (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Duke (1981), white clover usually behaves as a perennial, but it performs as an annual in warm climates and a biennial in cold.  The primary axis seldom lasts more than 2 years, but plants persist by forming new growth centers through rooted stolons and their apical meristems.  The plants are shallow rooted and spread by stolons that root at the nodes.  The species acts as a winter annual under adverse conditions, as in the southern United States.<P> The species is low growing with prostrate stems (McLeod, 1982).<P> White clover grows rapidly, and is a long-lived, true clover, spreading by creeping stems called stolons.  These elongate rapidly and root at the joints if soil is moist.  Thus, sparse stands may thicken by the end of the first year (Miller et al., 1951).<P> As related by Turkington (1989), <I>Trifolium repens</I></B> can reproduce either vegetatively or by seed.  In a permanent pasture, the species may display phenotypic plasticity allowing a clone to respond to local conditions (fine-grained environmental variability), and genotypic variability allowing different genets to respond differentially to coarse-grained environmental variability.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Height has been variously reported as 8-10 inches on good sites (Finch & Sharp, 1983) or 5-30 cm (Munz, 1973).  Mixed stands of strawberry and white clovers attained height of 33.02 +/- 3.28 cm (mean +/- SEM) (Bugg, R.L., pers. comm.) in early May, following October seeding in Mendocino County, California.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>White clover shows strong seedling vigor (Finch & Sharp, 1983). Seedlings are epigeal, and germination occurs at the soil surface (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Proposed seeding rates are variable: 0.45-5 kg/ha (Duke, 1981); 4 kg/ha (Gibson and Cope, 1985); 5 lb/acre (Finch & Sharp, 1983; Miller, 1988); 4 to 6 lb/acre (Hofstetter, 1988); 4 lbs/acre by ground or aerial application; or 5 or 6 lbs/acre (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Trifolium repens</I></B> L. (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>White clover and Ladino clover (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>White clover cultivars are classified arbitrarily by size of the plants, as small, intermediate, and large.  Small varieties frequently include the words "Wild White" in their names.  Most common are the intermediate-sized white clovers, which behave as annuals when stressed.  Large type white clovers do well where climatic and soil conditions are optimal but do not have as wide environmental tolerances as the smaller types (Carlson et al., 1985).  Of the three types, small is considered a weedy type (Miller, 1984).<P> Ladino clover is a variety of white clover (McLeod, 1982); intermediate types of white clover are more tolerant of heat than are ladino-type white clovers (Miller, 1984).  There are Canadian varieties of white clover that tolerate soil pH as low as 4.5. (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Seed may be harvested by three methods: (1) direct combining, (2) combining from the windrow, or (3) stationary thresher (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Miller et al. (1951) recommended harvesting for seed when 90-95% of the visible heads are brown and the flower stems (seed stalks) have started to dry.  In the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, this would be in July and August.  Withhold irrigation for 4 to 10 days prior to harvest.  According to Duke (1981), seed should be harvested when most seed heads are light brown, about 25-30 days after peak blossoming.  Mow and cure in swaths or in small windrows and retrieve using combines with pickup attachments.  Each handling causes some shattering, so minimize the number of operation. Complete drying of seeds may require artificial means or spreading and turning the covered seed.<P> White clover revives quickly after mowing because stems are not cut.  Four or five cuttings per year, at 35-40 day intervals, can be harvested in some areas (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that white clover or varieties thereof tolerate aluminum, drought, heavy soil, high ph, low pH, poor soil, and salt.  The species does better on clay or loam soils than on sandy soils.  White clover grows best on well-drained loam or clay soils of high fertility (Carlson et al., 1985).  McLeod (1982) advised that heavy, moist, well-drained, highly fertile soils are best and stated that with abundant rainfall, white clover will grow on sandier soil, but not reliably.<P> Ladino clover does well on soils with a high water table or with poor drainage (Miller, 1984), but it is not suited to dry, swampy, high-alkaline, or highly-saline sites (Gibson and Cope, 1985). White clover can grow on clays to silty loams if water is available all year (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> When grown for seed production, heavier clay or loam soils are best.  White clover does well on shallow soil underlain by a tight clay layer or a hardpan, even if this is 18 inches or slightly less of the surface.  On deep, open, friable, fertile soils, seed production seldom is good because plants do not produce abundant seed heads.  Luxuriant vegetative growth, sparse production of seed heads, and excessive water losses combine to reduce seed production (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Duke (1981), white clover usually behaves as a perennial, but it performs as an annual in warm climates and a biennial in cold.  Stolons glabrous, solid, creeping, 1-4 dm long, leaves long-petioled; leaflets cuneate-obovate to broadly oblong, emarginate to obtuse, 1-3 cm long, 0.75-2.5 cm broad, solid dull green or occasionally marked with a white "V" and sometimes with dark red flecks, denticulate; stipules pale except for the conspicuous nerves, abruptly narrowed to a point; peduncles scapiform, usually very elongate; heads subglobose in fruit, rather loose, 1.5-2.0 cm in diameter; flowers 20-40 (100); bracts membranous, at first equaling the pedicels but much exceeded by them as the latter elongate; pedicels often sparsely puberulent, elongating and recurving in age, the inner longer than the outer; flowers 6-10 mm long, fragrant; calyx-teeth unequal, the upper slightly shorter than the tube, the lower two-thirds its length; corolla white or rose tinged, becoming brown, 8 mm long, twice the length of the calyx; pods sessile, linear, exserted, usually 3- to 4-seeded, with 75-100 seeds per head.<P> As a perennial legume, this species spreads by stolons (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> Leaves, stems, and flower heads of Ladino clover generally are from two to four times as large as common white clover.  In shape, color and markings, the leaves and flower heads look like common white clover (Miller et al., 1951).<P> White clover can develop a taproot 1 m deep, but it dies at the end of the first year, and secondary roots developing from the stolon become the main root system.  The roots of white clover are mainly shallow (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Drilling is the preferred method, but broadcasting will suffice (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Miller et al. (1951) advised that, in preparing to seed white clover for seed production, it is desirable to have a fine, firm seedbed with a firm, moist bottom covered by two to three inches of moist, soil free of fine tilth.  Cultipack the soil before seeding.  Loose, cloddy seedbeds filled with air pockets may lead to patchy, poor stands.  Before planting, an irrigation settles and fills, revealing irregularities that can be corrected and provides moisture for germinating seed.  After the irrigation, level the field if irregular settling has occurred, then harrow and seed.<P> In establishing clover simultaneously with grass, drill grass seed in rows 40 to 50 cm apart, then broadcast white clover seed and cover them using a cultipacker (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> If establishing white clover amid preexisting warm-season grass sod, the clover should be seeded (possibly along with a cool-season grass such as ryegrass) in the fall when the grass is dormant.  Mow or graze the grass closely, broadcast the inoculated clover seed, and use a roller to press it into the soil.  If establishing the white clover during the spring, grass competition should be reduced by mowing or grazing closely, or by damaging strips of the grass by ploughing or banding herbicide (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> The herbicides propyzamide and carbetamide can be useful in suppressing incumbent grasses during the establishment phase of slot-seeded white clover (Standell, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed availability for white clover is good (Slayback, pers. comm.).  The Southern Seedsmen's Association 41st Edition 1990-91 Directory and Buyers' Guide lists 25 suppliers of white clover seed.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>White clover is relatively shallow rooted, with most roots in the top 20 cm of soil, although some roots extend to a depth of 1 m or more; clones expand through the adventitious rooting of stolons (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  Miller (1984) confirmed that the roots of white clover are mainly shallow; it can develop a taproot 1 m deep, but it dies at the end of the first year, and secondary roots developing from the stolon become the main root system.<P> Miller et al.  (1951) wrote that white clover plants have most roots in the upper 18 to 24 inches of soil.  Therefore, Ladino clover does well on soils too shallow for deep-rooted crops like alfalfa, sugar beets, or tree crops.  On deep, open soils, roots extend to four or five feet.<P> White clover taproot can extend to a depth of 1-3 ft (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed 41 species of nematodes as having been isolated from white clover, including several species each of <I>Meloidogyne</I></B>, <I>Heterodera</I></B>, and <I>Pratylenchus</I></B>.<P> In England, the nematode <I>Tylenchorynchus dubius</I></B> is known to damage white clover (Clements and Boag, 1990).<P> In the Southeast, the root-knot nematodes, <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp. damage white clover roots.  Host plant resistance, crop rotation, soil fertility, and proper cutting schedules can aid in control of these pests (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>White clover requires rhizobial inoculant type "B" (Nitragin Co.) (Burton and Martinez, 1980).<P> In reestablishing stands in warm regions, white clover seed should always be inoculated before sowing.  In cool regions, rhizobia from the preexisting white clover crop will survive in the soil (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), white clover probably originated in the eastern Mediterranean region of Asia Minor, and was spread to other continents by colonists; it ranges from the Boreal Moist to Wet through Subtropical Dry to Rain Forest Life Zones.  Munz (1973) listed it as naturalized to wet places in California, especially in the mountains and in northern parts of the state. Based on the account by Duke (1981), the species grows in a wide range of habitats, including dry meadows, mudflats, rarely on saline meadows, wood margins, open woods, banks of rivers and brooks, plains, semi-desert regions, and mountains up to the subalpine meadows.  It is a frequent weed on roadsides and in barrens. Miller et al.  (1951) noted that seed production is largely confined to irrigated areas in California, Oregon, and Idaho, where weather is favorable.  Seed can probably be produced in most of California at elevations under 3,000 feet, except where summer heat is excessive. High winds at harvest (July, August, and September) can be a problem.  Excessively fog or rain and snow at harvest may disrupt harvest and reduce seed quality.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Depending on local conditions, seeding should be done between September 15 and November 15.  Planting in the early fall insures larger and more productive Ladino plants in the first crop year.<P> Spring seedings are preferable if fields are foul with winter weeds, although the chances of obtaining a satisfactory seed crop are fewer.  In areas subject to severe winter frosts, planting should be completed early enough in the fall to insure seedling establishment before the first hard freeze (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>White clover seed is produced mainly in irrigated areas of the West (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  Duke (1981) summarized seed yields as being 30-200 kg/ha in humid climates and 150-600 kg/ha in th West.  First-season seed yields of 100-350 lbs/acre may result from early fall planting (Miller et al., 1951). Bees are important in pollination and seed production, and should be protected (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Animal manures, unless known to be weed-seed free, should not be used on seed fields (Miller et al., 1951).<P> For seed formation, Ladino clover flowers must be cross-pollinated.  1 to 1.5 beehives per acre is sufficient for complete pollination.  Bees should be moved in when blossoming starts, usually 2 to 3 weeks after the spring grazing or cutting is finished.  In California, bees are usually moved in about May 10, and are retained through the blooming period, i.e., until late August or September (Miller et al., 1951).<P> The average production of Ladino clover seed in California is about 100 lbs/acre.  Seed yields vary tremendously depending upon management and age of stand.  Early fall-planted, well-managed stands may produce 100 to 300 lbs or more of seed per acre the first season.  Some spring-planted stands do not produce any seed at all the first year.  Second-year stands give peak seed production, and may yield 250 to 5000 lbs per acre.  After the third year, seed yields usually decline rapidly, and there is seldom production after the fifth year.  Weeds such as ryegrass cause declining seed yields from the third year on (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Ladino is slow to establish.  Keep surface soil moist during germination. Early fall and late spring seedings require frequent light irrigations timed to keep the surface soil moist, preventing crusting and enabling emergence. Fall seeding is favored because rains may help establishment.  Do not allow the soil surface to remain dry more than two days until clover plants have at least four true leaves (Miller et al., 1951).<P> As noted by Gibson and Cope (1985), white clover clones expand through the adventitious rooting of stolons; nonetheless, establishment is crucial.  A good initial stand of white clover outperforms poor stands even after 3 years.<P> The herbicides propyzamide and carbetamide can be useful in suppressing incumbent grasses during the establishment phase of slot-seeded white clover (Standell, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Mowing in early May of the first season can reduce weed problems; stands should be mowed before the weeds produce seed. Annual weeds such as ryegrass, burclover, canarygrass, etc., may preclude a satisfactory stand of white clover.  Spring sowing of clover can circumvent this problem because the winter-germinated weeds can be destroyed during spring seedbed preparations (Miller et al., 1951).<P> For seed production, grazing or mowing by May 15 can reduce weeds. Grazed fields should be mowed thereafter to control weeds and equalize the stand (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Hartl, W.  (19??) reported replicated pot and field trials in which wheat was grown with undersown white clover, black medic, <I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> L., Persian clover, <I>Trifolium resupinatum</I></B> L., and various associated weeds.  In both pot and field trials, biomass of weeds alive at the time of harvest was reduced substantially (50% or more reduction).  The field trials showed reduction of wheat yield, as well, for black medic and Persian clover, but a non-significantly-increased yield when white clover, <I>Trifolium repens</I></B>, was used.<P> Bugg et al., (unpublished data) conducted a replicated study of various cover crops (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  Weed above-ground biomass data (dry) were taken in a replicated Cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990; harvest was on May 15-16, 1991.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass.  In plots sown to a mixture of white and strawberry clovers, weed biomass was 2.829+/-0.659 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.). This was 57.5% of the value obtained in weedy control plots.  Vegetational cover afforded by the clover mix was 77.50+/-3.23 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>Some Sacramento Valley seed producers used night lights to protect white clover stands against ducks in the winter. Airplanes were used to herd the ducks from their fields during the daytime. Otherwise, fields may be almost denuded in a few hours (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Munz (1973) listed the flowering period in California as April through December.  According to Duke (1981), flowering can be nearly year round in some areas and is from spring to fall in the North.  White clover shows a series of flowering periods or seed sets, which mature successively.  Blooming periods may be 12 to 20 days apart and often overlap.  Maximum bloom usually occurs 4 to 6 weeks after the last spring grazing or cutting (Miller et al., 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>In the first year, white clover mean phosphorus content is 5 lb/a, and potassium content, 35 lb/a (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>In California, white clover is often included in mixtures with strawberry clover because the former is shade tolerant and the latter tolerates heat. Thus, in an orchard understory with dappled shade and sun, the two species complement one another (Bugg, pers. comm.).  White clover is shade tolerant and does well in mature, irrigated, swampy pecan orchards in southern Georgia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds ovoid-truncate, ca 1.5 mm long and wide, surface smooth, usually entirely yellowish, sometimes reddish; 1,764,000 seeds per kg (Duke, 1981). White clover seed are small (1,764,000/kg, 77 kg/hl) (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Based on the account by Duke (1981), white clover usually behaves as a perennial but performs as an annual in warm climates and a biennial in cold. Stands regenerate themselves by reseeding and by vegetative (clonal) growth; both processes operate in the same stands (Gibson and Cope, 1985). Perenniation is by continual reestablishment of seedlings or rooting of new stolons (Miller, 1984).  Flowering and fruiting can occur nearly year-round in some areas, and spring to fall in the North (Duke, 1981).  White clover flowers develop once days lengthen to 14 hours and 15 minutes. (Miller, 1984).  Flowers are insect pollinated, and abundant bees are essential to cross pollination and high seed production (Duek, 1981).  White clover seedlings are epigeal; germination occurs at the soil surface (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>White clover behaves as a perennial by continual reestablishment of seedlings or rooting of new stolons (Miller, 1984).  White clover stands regenerate themselves by reseeding and by vegetative (clonal) growth; both processes operate in the same stands (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  White clover clones expand through the adventitious rooting of stolons; nonetheless, establishment is crucial, and a good initial stand of white clover outperforms poor stands even after 3 years (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> Young or thin stands can thicken rapidly.  When foliage is removed by grazing or clipping, recovery occurs in from 21 to 28 days (Miller et al., 1951).<P> White clover performs best under regimes of heavy grazing or mowing (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  Heavy accumulation of vegetation is deleterious to white clover because light is reduced, soil moisture may be depleted, and the microclimate predisposes for disease and insect problems.  Under such a regime, white clover is prone to have very succulent growth, and is unlikely to survive the microclimatic change that would result from sudden heavy mowing or grazing.<P> In managing mixed stands, grass height must be controlled to allow white clover to do well (Carlson et al., 1985).<P> In mixtures of white clover and bermuda grass or another warm- season grass, nitrogen should be applied in the late spring or summer, if the desire is to encourage the grass.  If the desire is to encourage cool-season grasses, the nitrogen should be applied in the fall or early spring (Miller, 1984).<P> Mixtures of grasses and white clover are difficult to maintain because grasses may shade the clover and because the clover requires high soil moisture levels.  If soil nitrogen is high, grasses will tend to predominate, whereas the clover will dominate if nitrogen is low (Miller, 1984).<P> In Austria, Danso et al.  (1991) conducted a 2-year trial in a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B> cv 'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I></B> cv 'Tacuabe').  White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated.  In the first year, both legumes contribute about equally to the approximately 130 kg N/ha fixed in the sward.  In the second year, white clover only contributed 5% of the 46 kg N/ha fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures including the two legumes have an advantage because the early production by white clover is complemented by later production and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil.  Stands with multiple legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990) reported that in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favored the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass.<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990) asserted that Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes. In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P> As related by Turkington (1989), <I>Trifolium repens</I></B> can reproduce either vegetatively or by seed.  In a permanent pasture, the species may display phenotypic plasticity allowing a clone to respond to local conditions (fine-grained environmental variability), and genotypic variability allowing different genes to respond differentially to coarse-grained environmental variability.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) ascribed salt tolerance to white clover or cultivars thereof, but the species is not suited to highly-saline sites, according to Gibson and Cope (1985).  This confirms the finding by Miller et al.  (1951), who wrote that the species does not do well on very saline soils.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>White clover seed should be sown at or near the soil surface, or at a depth of no more than 4 mm (Duke, 1981) or 5 mm (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>White clover performs best under regimes of heavy grazing or mowing (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  In tolerating close grazing (and, presumably, mowing) ladino white clover is exceeded only by birdsfoot trefoil and subterranean clover (Miller, 1984).  Heavy accumulation of vegetation is deleterious to white clover because light is reduced, soil moisture may be depleted, and the microclimate predisposes for disease and insect problems.  Under such a regime, white clover is prone to have very succulent growth, and is unlikely to survive the microclimatic change that would result from sudden heavy mowing or grazing (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> In managing mixed stands of white clover and grasses, grass height must be controlled to allow white clover to do well (Carlson et al., 1985).  Frequent mowing will encourage the clover (Miller, 1984), which revives quickly when cut for hay, because stems are not cut (McLeod, 1982).  Four or five cuttings per year, at 35-40 day intervals, can be harvested in some areas (McLeod, 1982).<P> Miller et al.  (1951) advised that first-year stands should not be grazed, except near the end of the season; otherwise, severe injury to the stand can result.  By contrast, spring grazing or mowing until mid-May is typical, helps in weed control weeds and promotes more uniform flowering and seed production (Miller et al., 1951).<P> According to Miller (1984), white clover is subject to root damage by the fungi <I>Sclerotium rolfsii</I></B> and <I>Sclerotinia trifoliorum</I></B>.  Root and stolon damage is caused by the fungi <I>Rhizoctonia</I></B>,  <I>Fusarium</I></B>, <I>Leptodiscus</I></B>, <I>Curvularia</I></B>, and <I>Colletotrichum</I></B>.  In the Southeast, the root-knot nematodes, <I>Meloidogyne</I></B> spp., damage white clover roots.  Host plant resistance, crop rotation, soil fertility, and proper cutting schedules can aid in control of these pests.<P> As noted by Kanyama-Phiri et al., (1990), in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass.  Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes. In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Gibson and Cope (1985) noted that heavy accumulation of vegetation is deleterious to white clover because light is reduced, soil moisture may be depleted, and the microclimate predisposes for disease and insect problems. Under such a regime, white clover is prone to have very succulent growth and is unlikely to survive the microclimatic change that would result from sudden heavy mowing or grazing.<P> Avoid insecticides other than sulfur if bees are working seed-producing stands of white clover (Miller et al., 1951).  Duke (1981) wrote that many arthropods attack white clover, including grasshoppers, clover leaf weevil (<I>Hypera punctata</I></B>), potato leafhopper (<I>Empoasca fabae</I></B>), meadow spittlebug (<I>Philaenis spumarius</I></B>), garden fleahopper (<I>Halticus bractatus</I></B>), spider mites, clover root curculio (<I>Sitona hispidula</I></B>), green june beetle (<I>Cotinus nitida</I></B>), lesser clover leaf weevil (Hypera nigrirostris), clover head weevil (<I>Hypera meles</I></B>), clover seed weevil (<I>Microtrogus picirostris</I></B>).  white clover flower midge (<I>Dasineura gentneri</I></B>), lygus bugs, clover aphid (<I>Nearctaphis bakeri</I></B>), green cloverworm (<I>Plathypena scabra</I></B>), cutworms, lesser cornstalk borer (<I>Elasmopalpus lignocellus</I></B>), alfalfa weevil (<I>Hypera postica</I></B>), blister beetles (<I>Epicauta</I></B> spp.), and the fall armyworm (<I>Spodoptera frugiperda</I></B>).<P> Potato leafhopper (<I>Empoasca fabae</I></B>) is the most important insect pest of white clover.  Other pests include meadow spittlebug, clover leaf weevil, alfalfa weevil, lygus bugs, clover seed weevil, and clover seed midge.  Crop resistance, weed control, and crop rotation may be important in controlling some insect pests (Miller, 1984).<P> Miller et al.  (1951) wrote that four species of spider mite (called red spiders) can cause damage, beginning in early May. These include Atlantic mite, brown almond mite, Pacific mite, and the two-spotted mite. These mites are usually found on the undersides of the leaves, and infested leaves become cupped, yellowish and spotted.  Heavily infested fields may appear dried-out and reddish-brown.  Lygus bugs may build up rapidly in seed fields in late May, June, and July.  These damage the flower parts and developing seed.  Various grasshopper species may move into Ladino fields in great numbers.  Infestations may originate in high, dry checks and borders, and fence rows within fields. Adjacent dry fields may be breeding grounds. Yellow-striped armyworm may damage seed fields,and in some cases may strip a field in 3 or 4 days.<P> Flexner et al.  (1990) related their studies in southern Oregonian pear orchards.  Certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems.  Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, white clover appeared particularly prone to outbreaks of the mite.  Use of herbicides led to increased movement by mites into trees.<P> Haley and Hogue (1990) assessed the influence of type of ground cover on apple aphid, <I>Aphis pomi</I></B> DeGeer (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its predators in a young apple orchard.  Four ground cover regimes were compared: (1) fall cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>), herbicided in spring and summer; (2) a mixture of white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I></B>) and grass; (3) herbicided tree-row strips and grassed-in alleys; and (4) woven black-plastic strips in the tree row and grassed alleys.  The trial was initiated at the beginning of the second year of the orchard.  Few aphidophagous insects of interest (e.g., the predatory mirids <I>Deraeocoris brevis</I></B> and <I>Campylomma verbasci</I></B>, the predatory midge <I>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</I></B>, lady beetles, hover flies, or lacewings) were found in the ground covers.  In the first year of the study, leaf nitrogen and aphid and predator densities were lower on trees with the white clover-grass mixture.  These differences did not occur the second year.  Terminal growth was particularly depressed for apple trees with understories of white clover and grass.<P> White clover is used as a nectar source by <I>Scolia</I></B> sp. (Scoliidae) and <I>Prionyx</I></B> sp.  (Sphecidae) wasps in pecan orchards of southern Georgia (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Sixty-two species of fungi have been recorded as attacking white clover, as is the bacterium <I>Pseudomonas syringae</I></B> and 14 types of virus (Duke, 1981).  Miller (1984) wrote that white clover is subject to root damage by the fungi <I>Sclerotium rolfsii</I></B> and <I>Sclerotinia trifoliorum</I></B>.  Root and stolon damage is caused by the fungi <I>Rhizoctonia</I></B>, <I>Fusarium</I></B>, <I>Leptodiscus</I></B>, <I>Curvularia</I></B>, and <I>Colletotrichum</I></B>. Host plant resistance, crop rotation, soil fertility, and proper cutting schedules can aid in control of these pests.<P> White clover can be attacked by several foliar and root diseases, as well as clover mosaic virus.  The latter cause more problems where white clover persists as a perennial and regenerates vegetatively than were it reseeds as an annual (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> Heavy accumulation of vegetation is deleterious to white clover because light is reduced, soil moisture may be depleted, and the microclimate predisposes for disease and insect problems.  Under such a regime, white clover is prone to have very succulent growth and is unlikely to survive the microclimatic change that would result from sudden heavy mowing or grazing (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> As of 1951, no serious diseases of economic importance had affected the Ladino crop in California (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Interspecific hybrids between <I>Trifolium repens</I></B> and <I>T. ambiguum</I></B> show resistance to peanut stunt mosaic, clover yellow vein virus, and alfalfa mosaic virus.  These resistances could prove valuable if they can be incorporated into adapted white clover varieties (Pederson and McLaughlin, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>White Clover grows best under cool, moist conditons (Carlson, et al., 1985) and is less drought tolerant than trefoil (Finch & Sharp, 1983).<P> Miller et al.  (1951) wrote that seed production usually necessitates irrigation about every 7 to 10 days during summer. With frequent irrigations, to produce good seed on open soils may require from 2 to 3 times that needed on heavier type soils.  On heavy clay soils the irrigation interval may range from ten to twenty-one days.<P> Miller et al.  (1951) recommended the strip-check system of land preparation and irrigation.  A modified version of the contour check system of irrigation, was also successful for irrigated pastures but was rarely used for Ladino seed production. Immediate and complete drainage following the irrigation is essential to avoid seed damage through germination and drowning of plants. Sprinklers may be used where land cannot be leveled. Clover-seed fields require frequent irrigation, so land preparation should be calculated to minimize labor costs.<P> Madson (1951) suggested that white clover should be irrigated when leaves begin to cup together.  This may occur in sandy or hard spots at first.  Field condition in general should be considered. Do not withhold irrigation until the entire field is wilting.<P> Irrigation should replenish the soil moisture to the depth of the white clover roots.  Examine the soil to ascertain the depth of soil and the root zone.  From 1 to 3 inches of water per irrigation will usually suffice. Larger applications will be wasteful and perhaps harmful.  Ponding in hot weather can drown plants (Miller et al., 1951).<P> It is customary to withhold water for 4 to 10 days before a field is cut for seed.  Miller et al.  (1951), however, advised not intentionally drying up a field which has a good developing seed crop, because this would reduce seed yield, cause much seed to shrivel, and reduce germination.  Whereas Ladino clover requires frequent irrigation, its annual requirement usually does not exceed that of alfalfa.  In most of California, Ladino requires from 3 to 5 acre-feet of water per acre annually.  In the interior valleys on open, permeable soils 6 to 9 acre-feet year may be needed.<P> If water is withheld before harvest, irrigate immediately afterward, to minimize drought damage.  This can also increase fall pasturage.  Irrigations should be given frequently in the fall until the seasonal rains begin (Miller et al., 1951).<P> White clover can grow on clays to silty loams if water is available all year (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  Ladino clover does well on soils with a high water table or with poor drainage (Miller, 1984), but it is not suited to dry, swampy, high-alkaline, or highly-saline sites (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> Mixtures of grasses and white clover are difficult to maintain because grasses may shade the clover and because the clover requires high soil moisture levels.  If soil nitrogen is high, grasses will tend to predominate, whereas the clover will dominate if nitrogen is low (Miller, 1984).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that white clover tolerates soil pH of 4.5-8.2, with the mean of 89 cases being 6.3, and stated that the species or cultivars thereof show tolerance to both high and low pH.  The species is said not to grow well in alkaline soil, and the best pH range is 6.0 to 6.5 (McLeod, 1982), 6 to 7 (Carlson et al., 1985), or 6.5 to 7.0 (Hofstetter, 1988), with the optimal pH for white clover said to be 6.5 (Duke, 1981; Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P> Some Canadian varieties of white clover can tolerate soil pH as low as 4.5 (Miller, 1984), but acid soil should be limed to a pH of 6.0-6.5 before seeding white clover (Carlson et al., 1985).<P> White clover is not suited to dry, swampy, high-alkaline, or highly-saline sites (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) related that white clover tolerates mean annual temperatures of 4.3-21.8 C, with the mean of 101 cases being 11.6.<P> White clover grows best under cool, moist conditions (Carlson, et al., 1985) and is about as hardy as Red Clover or Alfalfa (McLeod, 1982).  Hofstetter (1988) termed it extremely winter-hardy.<P> Miller et al.  (1951) advised that in districts subject to severe frosts, clover-seed fields should enter winter with at least 6 to 8 inches of growth.  Such growth protects the stand against excessive frost damage.  With mild climates, the grazing can continue into winter without serious damage ensuing.<P> Heritability of frost tolerance in white clover is high (0.75-0.93), suggesting that incorporation of frost tolerance into agronomically-suitable, but frost-sensitive cultivars could be successful (Caradus, et al., 1990).<P> As heat tolerance is concerned, intermediate types of white clover are more resistant than ladino types (Miller, 1984).  Hot dry periods during the summer reduce growth of white clover, but plants will usually survive (McLeod, 1982)<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>White clover is very good for soil conservation (Miller, 1984) because stolons provide ground cover that stabilizes soil (Gibson and Cope, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Duke reported that the cultivar 'Regal Ladino' was selected for tolerance to the herbicides 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, and 2,4,5-T.  The herbicide 2,4-DB does not injure grass or white clover (Miller, 1984).  Also, the herbicides propyzamide and carbetamide can be useful in suppressing incumbent grasses during the establishment phase of slot-seeded white clover (Standell, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>White clover is usually grown in mixtures with grasses (Duke, 1981); the latter can be either temperate or tropical grasses (Bowdler and Pigott, 1990). Examples include Bermudagrass, bromegrass, dallisgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, orchardgrass, tall fescue, or timothy (Gibson and Cope, 1985).  In mixtures with grasses, frequent mowing will encourage the white clover (Miller, 1984).<P> Companion or nurse crops of barley or oat are not recommended for fall seedings, but may be used for spring-sown Ladino on tight soils which seal or cake.  Nurse plants lead to better spring-sown stands by shading and reducing surface moisture loss. Therefore, white clover seedlings are better able to establish. Mow the nurse crop promptly once the clover has established, to reduce competition (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Gibson and Cope (1985) recommended that if establishing clover simultaneously with grass, one should drill grass seed in rows 40 to 50 cm apart, then broadcast white clover seed and cover them using a cultipacker. In establishing white clover amid preexisting warm-season grass sod, the clover should be seeded (possibly along with a cool-season grass such as ryegrass) in the fall when the grass is dormant.  Mow or graze the grass closely, broadcast the inoculated clover seed, and use a roller to press it into the soil. If establishing the white clover during the spring, grass competition should be reduced by mowing or grazing closely, or by damaging strips of the grass by ploughing or banding herbicide.<P> The herbicides propyzamide and carbetamide can be useful in suppressing incumbent grasses during the establishment phase of slot-seeded white clover (Standell, 1990).  By contrast, the herbicide 2,4-DB does not injure grass or white clover (Miller, 1984).<P> In mixtures of white clover and bermuda grass or another warm-season grass, Gibson and Cope (1985) advised that nitrogen should be applied in the late spring or summer, if the desire is to encourage the grass.  If the desire is to encourage cool-season grasses, the nitrogen should be applied in the fall or early spring.<P> Mixtures of grasses and white clover are difficult to maintain because grasses may shade the clover and because the clover requires high soil moisture levels.  If soil nitrogen is high, grasses will tend to predominate, whereas the clover will dominate if nitrogen is low (Miller, 1984).  White clover is a poor competitor with grass for soil P (Mackay et al., 1990).<P> Woledge (1988.) wrote that mixtures of perennial ryegrass (<I>Lolium perenne</I></B> L.) and white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I></B> L.) yield less than heavily fertilized monocultures of the former. Addition of small amounts of nitrogen in the spring leads to reduction of the proportions of clover in the stand.  The present study indicated that the relative growth rate of clover is as great as that of the grass when nitrogen is added, and greater when nitrogen is not added.  There was no evidence that fertilized grass overtopped clover.  Clover showed a smaller ratio of leaf area to total above-ground dry weight, but had a higher proportion of its lamina in the upper, well-lit strata.<P> In Austria, Danso et al.  (1991) conducted a 2-year trial in a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B> cv 'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I></B> cv 'Tacuabe').  White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated.  In the first year, both legumes contributed about equally to the approximately 130 kg N/ha fixed in the sward.  In the second year, white clover only contributed 5% of the 46 kg N/ha fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures including the two legumes have an advantage because the early production by white clover is complemented by later production and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil.  Stands with multiple legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al.  (1990) wrote that in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, close mowing alternating with 30-31 day regrowth periods apparently favors the two clovers and the perennial ryegrass.  The clovers were most productive with 60 kg/ha of N added. Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes. In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November. By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P> Turkington (1989) reported that <I>Trifolium repens</I></B> in the same 1-ha old field will diverge genetically through time depending on the grass species with which it is associated. Reciprocal transplant experiments have demonstrated differential success of <I>T. repens</I></B> from areas dominated by the grasses <I>Lolium perenne</I></B> or <I>Agrostis capillaris</I></B> to areas dominated by the original grass or other perennial grasses.  The results suggested that, even within a field, white clover clones are genetically adapted to perform better amid stands of particular grasses.<P> In replicated pot and field trials, Hartl, W. (19??) grew wheat with undersown white clover, black medic, <I>Medicago lupulina</I></B> L., Persian clover, <I>Trifolium resupinatum</I></B> L., and various associated weeds.  In both pot and field trials, biomass of weeds alive at the time of harvest was reduced substantially (50% or more reduction).  The field trials showed reduction of wheat yield, as well, for black medic and Persian clover, but a non-significantly-increased yield when white clover, <I>Trifolium repens</I></B>, was used.<P> Studies by McNeill and Wood (1990) in an environmental chamber with an atmosphere enriched by 15N indicated that white clover did not rapidly transfer nitrogen to associated ryegrass.  The plants were mycorrhizal.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>White clover may require the equivalent of 300-600 kg/ha of 20% superphosphate and 60-250 kg/ha of muriate of potash (Duke, 1981). It is a poor competitor with grass for soil P (Mackay et al., 1990).  112 white clover cultivars and 7 breeding lines from 25 countries were evaluated for response to added P.  Cultivars that responded to low levels of added P were all from countries with cold winters.  119 cultivars and lines of white clover were originally evaluated for response to P addition.  Based on principal components analysis, these were assigned to 8 groups. 26 of the varieties were selected to represent the 8 groups.  The varieties that absorbed the most P also accumulated the most N (Mackay et al., 1990). Caradus et al.  (1990) wrote that in New Zealand, the large-leaved white clover cultivar 'Grasslands Kopu' showed better growth response to P and higher yields than did 'Barbian', 'Grasslands Tahora', or 'Grasslands Huia.' Maximum yield of 'Grasslands Kopu' was also attained at a lower level of added P.<P> White clover responds well to addition of gypsum or flowers of sulfur as sulfur sources.  It showed a 63% increase in dry matter production following application to a 2-year-old stand (Bowdler and Pigott, 1990).<P> Mixtures of grasses and white clover are difficult to maintain because grasses may shade the clover and because the clover requires high soil moisture levels.  If soil nitrogen is high, grasses will tend to predominate, whereas the clover will dominate if nitrogen is low (Miller, 1984).<P> Kanyama-Phiri et al., (1990) wrote that in strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, the clovers were most productive with 60 kg/ha of N added. Strawberry clover and ladino clover are similar in morphology and growth habit but differ in response to different nutrient and grazing regimes. In strawberry clover - white clover - perennial ryegrass - orchardgrass mixtures, with no added nitrogen, ladino clover peaked in dry matter production in October, then fell off during November. Strawberry clover peaked in November.  By contrast, when nitrogen was added (60, 120, and 180 kg/ha of N added), these situations were reversed.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>White clover may yield as much as 225 kg/ha of nitrogen per year, or up to double this in New Zealand, where a 10-month growing season prevails (Miller, 1984).<P> In Austria, Danso et al.  (1991) conducted a 2-year trial in a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B> cv 'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I></B> cv 'Tacuabe').  White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated.  In the first year, both legumes contributed about equally to the approximately 130 kg N/ha fixed in the sward.  In the second year, white clover only contributed 5% of the 46 kg N/ha fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures including the two legumes have an advantage because the early production by white clover is complemented by later production and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil.  Stands with multiple legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<P> First-year white clover mean nitrogen content is 81 lb/a, according to Brinton (1989).  Nitrogen content of white clover averages 3.8%.  A good stand should provide 100 lb of N per acre when plowed at bud stage (Hofstetter, 1988).<P> Haley and Hogue (1990) assessed influence of type of ground cover on apple aphid, <I>Aphis pomi</I></B> DeGeer (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its predators in a young apple orchard.  Four ground cover regimes were compared: (1) fall cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I></B>), herbicided in spring and summer; (2) a mixture of white clover (<I>Trifolium repens</I></B>) and grass; (3) herbicided tree-row strips and grassed-in alleys; and (4) woven black-plastic strips in the tree row and grassed alleys.  The trial was initiated at the beginning of the second year of the orchard.  Few aphidophagous insects of interest (e.g., the predatory mirids <I>Deraeocoris brevis</I></B> and <I>Campylomma verbasci</I></B>, the predatory midge <I>Aphidoletes aphidimyza</I></B>, lady beetles, hover flies, or lacewings), were found in the ground covers.  In the first year of the study, leaf nitrogen and aphid and predator densities were lower on trees with the white clover-grass mixture.  These differences did not occur the second year. Terminal growth was particularly depressed for apple trees with understories of white clover and grass.<P> McNeill and Wood (1990) conducting studies in an environmental chamber with an atmosphere enriched by 15N indicated that white clover did not rapidly transfer nitrogen to associated ryegrass. The plants were mycorrhizal.<P> Mackay et al.  (1990) evaluated 119 cultivars and lines of white clover for response to P addition.  Based on principal components analysis, these were assigned to 8 groups.  26 of the varieties were selected to represent the 8 groups.  The varieties that absorbed the most P also accumulated the most N.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>In Austria, Danso et al.  (1991) conducted a 2-year trial in a triple-species mixed sward of white clover (cv 'Zapican'), birdsfoot trefoil (<I>Lotus corniculatus</I></B> cv 'Gabriel') and fescue (<I>Festuca arundinacea</I></B> cv 'Tacuabe').  White clover showed good production for the first harvest of the first year; thereafter, birdsfoot trefoil dominated.  In the first year, both legumes contributed about equally to the approximately 130 kg N/ha fixed in the sward.  In the second year, white clover only contributed 5% of the 46 kg N/ha fixed in the last two harvests. Mixtures including the two legumes have an advantage because the early production by white clover is complemented by later production and better persistence by birdsfoot trefoil.  Stands with multiple legumes often show better livestock weight gains.<P> White clover is very palatable to livestock.  In mixture with grasses and other legumes, it provides highly productive, nutritive pasture and is the basic legume in California's irrigated pasture (Miller et al., 1951).<P> Miller et al.  (1951) wrote that cut Ladino clover dries slowly; it is usually ensiled rather than cured for hay.  70 to 80 lbs of cane molasses can be added per ton of green clippings going into the silo; this improves silage quality and feeding value.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>The mean proportion of dry weight of white clover comprised by N is 0.038 (Hostetter, 1988); 225 kg N/ha added annually to pastures in the U.S. (Miller, 1984).  Based on these assumptions, an annual biomass production of 5.921 Mg/ha can be projected (Bugg, pers. comm.).  In New Zealand, with a 10-month growing period, the N figure can supposedly be doubled (Miller, 1984), and thus, presumably, so can the biomass figure.  By contrast, if we assume the mean crude protein content of 22% given by Duke (1981) and 6.25% of the protein being N, the projection is 16.36 Mg/ha, which seems inordinately high (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Dry matter yield of white clover should equal or exceed that of red clover (1,500 to 2,000 lb/acre) (Hofstetter, 1988). In mid-May, a first-year stand of a fall-sown mixed stand of strawberry and white clover yielded an above-ground dry biomass of 3.941+/-0.872 Mg/ha (Mean +/- S.E.M.) in an organic vineyard in Mendocino County, California.  This figure is significantly less than that of the standing biomass for various winter-annual vetches, clovers, and medics sown in the same trial.  With weeds including, the corresponding figure is 6.771+/-1.242 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> White clover responds well to addition of gypsum or flowers of sulfur as sulfur sources.  It showed a 63% increase in dry matter production following application to a 2-year-old stand (Bowdler and Pigott, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Dutch white clover cost $2.80 per lb, New Zealand white clover $2.80, and ladino clover $3.33 retail in 1993 (Fred Thomas, pers comm.).<P>

<H3>USDA Sustainable Systems Research</H3>

<P>
The USDA National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program
(NRICGP) is supporting a new competitive awards program for agricultural
systems research in fiscal year 1994. It is seeking innovative
systems research that integrates knowledge of individual system
elements into a larger framework for use in analyzing or developing
improved agricultural practices.  The proposed research should
fit in either of two categories: 1) identification and adoption
of integrated, resource efficient, and economical agricultural
systems that maintain productivity and profitability, and safeguard
the environment and human health; or 2) identification of agricultural
systems and policies that strengthen and revitalize rural communities
and regions. To receive a copy of the 1994 Request for Proposals
for the National Research Initiative call (202) 401-5022. Ask
for parts 1 and 2 of the program description. The proposal deadline
for ag systems grants is February 22, 1994.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Fertilizer Research Awards</H3>

<P>
 A Request for Proposal will be out January 30 from the California
Department of Food and Agriculture's Fertilizer Research and Education
Program. Funding will be available for projects directed toward
the environmentally safe and agronomically sound use and handling
of fertilizer materials. Proposals will be due April 30, 1994.
For details and to be put on the proposal request mailing list,
contact <B>Jacques</B> <B>Franco</B> or <B>Gwen Cristoni</B> at
CDFA, (916) 654-0574. <BR>

<H3>Organic Research Grants</H3>

<P>
The Organic Farming Research Foundation is offering funds for
organic farming methods research, dissemination of research results
to organic farmers and growers interested in making the transition
to organic production systems, and education of the public about
organic farming issues. Projects should involve farmers in both
design and execution, and take place on working farms whenever
possible and appropriate. Proposals of $3,000-$5,000 are encouraged.
Most projects will be less than $10,000. Matching funds from other
sources and/or in-kind contributions from cooperators are encouraged
but not required. Proposals are considered twice a year. Proposals
must be received by January 31, 1994. To receive copies of grant
application procedures and the &quot;OFRF Research and Education
Priorities which describes target areas, write Grants Program,

Blossoms attract honeybees, tachinid flies, large predatory wasps, but not small wasps (e.g., Aphytis  sp. wasps, a parasite of San Jose scale)<LI>
Rarely used as a cover crop in California, except in insectary mixes</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed both white and yellow sweetclovers as annual and biennial herbs.  McLeod (1982) wrote that both species are summer growing, biennial legumes but that there are annual varieties of <I>Melilotus alba</I></B>.  The latter point was confirmed by both Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) and Madson (1951) who both cited cv 'Hubam' as an example of the annual form of the white species.  'Hubam' is usually seeded in the spring and tilled under in the fall (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>All <I>Melilotus</I></B> species contain a vanilla-smelling substance, coumarin, which embitters the older stems and leaves (McLeod, 1982).  According to Duke (1981), coumarin is an anticoagulant.  The following points are also based on accounts in Duke (1981):  Yellow sweetclover seeds are poisonous to horses. 'Polara' and 'Denta' are low-coumarin varieties of white sweetclover; there are also low-coumarin forms of yellow sweetclover.  Once plants have reached 20-25 in height, heavy grazing is essential to maintain palatability. Moldy hay of yellow sweetclover may poison cattle through a chemical bishyroxycoumarin.<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>According to the description by Duke (1981), white sweetclover is an annual or biennial, erect or decumbent herb, stem 1 m or more tall, stipules entire; leaves trifoliate, leaflets lanceolate or oblanceolate to narrowly oblong, rarely ovate, 1-2.5 cm long; rachis of larger leaves, excluding terminal petiolule, often prolonged more than 4 mm beyond lateral leaflets; racemes numerous, 5-20 cm long, on peduncles up to 4 cm longl; pedicels 1-2 mm long; calyx about 2 mm long; corolla white, 4-6 mm long; style 1.7-2.3 mm long; pod with weak irregular network of veins.<P> Duke (1981) described yellow sweetclover as a biennial or annual herb with strong taproot; stems erect or ascending, 0.3-2.8 m tall, often tinged with red; leaves trifoliate, the leaflets of the lower and middle leaves broadly oval, lanceolate to rhomboid-ovate, 1-5 cm long, rounded at tip, those of upper leaves oblong-lanceolate, rounded or truncate at tip, irregularly dentate or entire; stipules entire, 8-12 mm long, lanceolate or subulate; racemes lax, 30-80 flowered, 4-15 cm long; pedicels 2-2.5 mm long; clayx 2-3 mm long, teeth as long as tube or shorter; corolla yellow, 4.5-7 mm long, standard and wings more or less equal to or up to 1 mm longer than keel; style 1.7-2.3 mm long, often persisting; ovules 4-6, rarely 3 or 8; pods ca, 3.4 mm long, 2-2.5 mm broad , 1.5 mm thick, compressed with strong rugose transverse veins or wrinkled gray to straw-colored, rarely black, obtuse at tip.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that white sweetclover could be used as forage, hay, and ensilage, and for pasture and soil imporvement. It is also used as a green manure and cover crop and is a top honey plant.  Cortical fiber can be used for paper manufacture, and seed oil is used in paint and varnish.  Seed meal is detoxified and used as a protein supplement in cattle feed. Yellow sweetclover is used for forage, hay, pasture, and soil improvement and erosion prevention.  As an herb, it is used to flavor cheeses and tobacco snuff, and seeds used as a substiture for Tonka beans.  It is also a honey plant, and Kalmuks use the roots for food.<P> McLeod (1982) wrote that sweetclover can be used as hay, pasture, and green manure.  Sweetclovers are recommended for renovation of very poor, thin soils.  They fit well in a rotation with a cereal and corn.  The sweetclover is sown with the cereal, wheat, oat or barley, for example.  Even flax can be used in this manner.  They act as nurse crops for the sweetclover.<P> Madson (1951) remarked that sweetclovers are little used as winter cover crops because growth occurs too late in the spring for them to fit into the usual cover crop program.  Where they fit a short rotation program, they are excellent for opening up heavy soils.<P> Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) stated that white sweetclover is grown for nitrogen fixation, organic matter, and soil life enhancement.<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers can be difficult to incorporate, and regrowth can be a problem (Schonbeck, 1988).  White sweetclover may be turned under at any time, according to Duke (1981).  However, McLeod (1982) advised cultivating in the early spring, rather than the fall, because biennial forms will resume growing the second year if turned under in the fall, but not in the spring.  Duke (1981) recommended that yellow sweetclover is best incorporated during the second spring, after the stand is more that 15 cm tall.<P> Mouldboard plough, rotavator, tandem disc, offset disc, and heavy duty cultivator were evaluated as tools for incorporating yellow sweetclover prior to spring wheat planting.  There were no significant differences due to implement for amount of soil nitrogen in the 0-60 cm profile (Foster, 1990).<P> Foster (1990) also evaluated three dates of incorporation for incorporating yellow sweetclover prior to spring wheat planting: June 15, July 1, and July 15.  June 15 incorporation gave the best result in terms of the amount of soil nitrogen in the 0-60 cm profile (59, 66, and 70 kg/ha in the three years of the study), and for grain yield of the wheat.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>White sweetclover is native to Europe and western and central Asia, south to India; it is assigned to the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Centers of Diversity, and is native to the Boreal Moist to Wet through Subtropical Dry to Moist Forest Life Zones, and persists up to an altitude of 2,000 m (Duke, 1981).  As noted by Munz (1973), in California, the species is abundantly naturalized in waste places, especially in damp zones in southern California. It occurs from British Columbia to the East Coast of the United States.<P> Based on Duke's (1981) account, yellow sweetclover is assigned to the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean Centers of Diversity, and is native from Europe to central temperate Asia and western China, south to North Africa, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and has been introduced to various temperate reions, including North and South America.  It is cultivated in India.  It ranges form the Boreal Moist through Warm Temperate Thorn to Moist Forest Life Zones, and persists up to an altitude of 4,000 m.  In California, Munz (1973) noted that yellow sweetclover is less commonly naturalized than white sweetclover or sourclover. According to McLeod (1982), sweetclovers will grow almost anywhere, given sufficient and suitably-distributed rainfall. They grow in southern Canada and throughout the United States, thriving in both semiarid and humid regions.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) detailed the soil tolerances of the two main sweetclovers. White sweetclover tolerates heavy clays to light sands and does especially well on calcareous soils; it is said to tolerate alkali, limestone, high pH, mine sites, poor soil, slope, and waterlogging.  Yellow sweetclover tolerates clays to light sands but does best on fertile, well-limed and -drained soils with good organic matter content.  Yellow sweetclover has been said to tolerate alkali, high pH, limstone, slope, and both heavy and poor soils.<P> McLeod (1982) confirmed that sweetclovers tolerate cemented clays and gravels to poor sand and stated that the the deep roots open the subsoil.  He also mentioned that the white species prefers clay loams and that the yellow does best on loam soils.<P> Madson (1951) stated that sweetclover tolerates loam to heavy soil types.<P> Schonbeck (1988) wrote that yellow sweetclover does well on soils that will not support true clovers (<I>Trifolium</I></B> spp.).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>White sweetclover tolerates pH of from 4.8-8.2, with the mean of 50 cases being 6.7, whereas the corresponding figures for yellow sweetclover tolerates pH of from 4.8-8.2, with the mean of 43 cases being 6.6.  Both species are regarded as tolerant of alkali, high pH, and limestone (Duke, 1981).<P> Sweetclovers are intolerant of acid soils (Duke, 1981; Brinton, 1989). According to Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983), white sweetclover requires soil pH of at least 6.8.  and best growth occurs on neutral or alkaline soil with abundant lime.  If soil pH is less than 6, soil should be limed well in advance of seeding (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers have deep taproots and might be expected to mine nutrients from deeper soil strata (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> McLeod (1982) ascribed to sweetclovers the ability to convert the insoluble nutrients phosphorus and potassium from forms unavailable to other plants.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers may be sown during the fall or spring (McLeod, 1982); Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) of Maine wrote that biennial forms of both the white and yellow species can be sown in spring or late summer.  Unscarified seed of both species germinates better when sown in the fall; white sweetclover also does better with fall sowing (McLeod, 1982).  Madson (1951) suggested sowing from October to November.  The annual form of white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') did well in Massachusetts when sown in early May (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rate is 10 to 15 lbs/acre of scarified or 25 lbs/acre of unscarified seed (McLeod, 1982).  Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) suggested that white sweetclover be seeded at 15 lbs/acre. Madson (1951) recommended that cv 'Hubam' be seeded at 20 to 30 lbs/acre. Duke (1981) wrote that both white and yellow sweetclovers should be seeded at 11-17 or for the white species up to 25 kg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>White sweetclover is small seeded and rather slow to establish, and problems with weeds should be expected (Bugg, pers. comm.). This was confirmed by McLeod (1982) who commented that the plants grow slowly at first.  A small-grain companion crop can reduce weed problems for either the white or yellow species (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers should be sown at a depth of 1/2 inch (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>Seed remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>White sweetclover shows erect or decumbent growth; yellow sweeclover stems are erect or ascending.  Both are listed as annual or biennial herbs (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed cost of sweetclovers is low (Madson, 1951).   Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) in 1993 listed the market retail prices as $2.50/lb for 'Hubam' annual white sweet clover and $0.80/lb for yellow sweetclover.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers are considered resistant to cold (Madson, 1951).<P> Duke, (1981) detailed the thermal tolerances for the sweetclovers. White sweetclover tolerates an annual mean temperature range of 5.7-24.3 C, with the mean of 54 cases being 12.7; the corresponding figures for yellow white sweetclover are 4.9-21.8 C, with the mean of 47 cases being 10.9 C .  White and yellow sweetclovers tolerate high and low temperatures and are seldom winter-killed.  Both species are said to be tolerant of both heat and frost. There are intervarietal differences in winterhardiness for white sweetclover, with 'Arctic' and 'Polara' both tolerant of Canadian conditions. For yellow sweetclover, cv 'Madrid' was noted as relatively resistant to fall freezes.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>White sweetclover occurs in both annual and biennial forms. 'Hubam,' 'Emerald,' 'Floranna,' and 'Israel' are cultivars of the annual form of white sweetclover (Madson, 1951).  'Denta' is a late-maturing, low-coumarin variety. 'Arctic,' an early-maturing winter-hardy variety (presumably biennial) and the low-coumarin cv 'Polara' are both adapted to Canada.  The low-coumarin gene was transferred from <I>Melilotus dentata</I></B> (Waldst.  and Kit.) Pers. to <I>M.  alba</I></B> and then to <I>M.  officinalis</I></B> (Duke, 1981).<P> According to Duke (1981), yellow sweetclover comprises 3 subspecies and about 16 ecotypes and forms.  Recommended cultivars include 'Albotrea.' 'Common Yellow,' 'Erector,' 'Madrid,' 'Switzer,' and 'Goldtop.'<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>As related by Duke (1981), for the biennial forms of the white species, hay yields the first year range from 2.2-3.5 Mg/ha, and in the second year 2.2-8.1 Mg/ha.  In India, the annual form ('Hubam') can yield 9-10.5 Mg/ha in three cuttings.  For yellow sweetclover, yields of cv 'Madrid' can be 4.2-4.5 Mg/ha in the first year, and 5.5-8.5 Mg/ha in the second.<P> Above-ground biomass yields for yellow sweetclover at 15 July (following establishment by overseeding into standing wheat during late April or early May the previous year) were 1,320, 2,117, and 3,238 kg/ha during a three-year study in Saskatchewan (Foster, 1990).<P> Mid-May harvest harvest of fall-sown mixed biennial sweetclovers yielded 1.656+/-0.626 Mg/ha, Mean +/-S.E.M.  in an organic vineyard in Hopland, Mendocino County, California.  When weeds were included, the biomass was 4.930+/-0.620 (Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>The biennial form of white sweetclover has a deep taproot; however, in the north, mowing or grazing during the first year prevents good root growth (Duke, 1981).  Johnny's Selected Seeds (1983) wrote that biennial sweetclover has a deep, strong root system that can penetrate through soil layers.<P> White and yellow sweetclovers have deep taproots, according to Bugg (pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Duke's (1981) review indicated that sweetclovers are attacked by sweetclover weevil, <I>Sitona cylindricollis</I></B>, which can destroy a crop by defoliating seedlings.  Sweetclover root borer, <I>Walshi miscecolorella</I></B>, and sweetclover aphid, <I>Therioaphis riehmi</I></B> (Boerner), damage sweetclover in the Great Plains.  Some resistance is available for the latter. Blister beetles, <I>Epicauta</I></B> spp., feed on foliage of low-coumarin cultivars. Grasshoppers, leafhoppers, clover leaf weevil, cutworms, webworms, green cloverworm (<I>Platyena scabra</I></B>) and other caterpillars are seldom serious problems.<P> In a field trial in coastal Massachusetts, Bugg and Ellis (1990) found that high densities of nectarivorous predatory wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae and Sphecidae) were attracted to the flowers of annual white sweetclover (11 taxa).  Buckwheat floral nectar also attracted several species of predatory wasps and appeared to be a more flexible means of attracting wasps, inasmuch as it grows rapidly and flowers sooner (30 days vs about 60 days).  Of course, biennial forms of white sweetclover would have flowered still later than the annual form used here, i.e., during the subsequent year. Although several Fabaceae afford extrafloral nectar, white sweetclover appears to be among the few that provide floral nectar accessible and attractive to numerous predatory wasps.  Buckwheat often ceases production of nectar during afternoon hours. Afternoon activity usually appeared low on buckwheat, whereas nectarivores continued to visit white sweetclover.  No Ichneumonoidea were observed imbibing at the flowers of white sweetclover, and few were observed at blooms of buckwheat.  Peak densities of sweetclover aphid, <I>Therioaphis riehmi</I></B> (Boerner), were observed on July 23rd.  However, compared to what was observed in faba bean, sorghum, and hairy vetch, relatively few Coccinellidae were seen on white sweetclover.  It is not clear whether sweetclover aphid was less palatable than aphids available on other cover crops.<P> Based on observations in New Mexico, flowers of yellow sweetclover attract predaceous wasps (e.g., <I>Ammophila</I></B> sp. [Sphecidae]) (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>White and yellow sweetclovers require rhizobial strain "A" (Nitragin Co.), the same strain used for alfalfa (Burton and Martinez, 1980).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>White sweetclover attains a height of of 1 m or more, and yellow sweetclover attains heights of from 0.3 m to 2.8 m (Duke, 1981). Munz (1973) listed white sweetclover as attaining 1-2 m.<P> Annual white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') slightly exceeded 1.00 m (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P> White sweetclover grows over 6 ft.  high (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983). Sweetclovers can attain heights of 4-8 feet, and growth is vigorous (Schonbeck, 1988). In Mendocino County, height in May of October-sown mixed stands of white and yellow sweetclovers was 22.23+/-5.81 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed white and yellow sweetclovers as flowering during summer and fall.  Munz (1973) listed white sweetclover as flowering from May through September, and yellow from May through August.  McLeod (1982) stated that the yellow species blooms earlier than the white.<P> Annual white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') sown on May 7 attained full flower during the first week of August (coastal Massachusetts) (Bugg and Ellis, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>The seed of white sweetclover has a hard testa, requiring scarification to ensure prompt germination (Duke, 1981).  Seed of sweetclover should be covered lightly (Johnny's Selected Seeds, 1983).  In Mendocino wine vineyards, double disking followed by broadcasting and cultipacking was used (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In New York state, Scott and Burt (1985) evaluated cover crops after overseeding into corn 6-18" high were medium red clover, mammoth red clover, alfalfa, yellow sweetclover, alsike clover, birdsfoot trefoil, Canada field peas, Austrian winter peas, cowpeas, perennial or annual ryegrass, medium red clover + ryegrass, or medium red clover + rye.  Of these, alfalfa, medium red clover, yellow sweetclover, hairy vetch, ryegrass, and medium red clover + ryegrass have performed well.<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>There is some confusion over the correct species names and authorities for both white and yellow sweetclovers.  Duke (1981) termed white sweetclover <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Medik., whereas Munz (1973) termed it <I>Melilotus albus</I></B> Desrousseaux.  Bailey and Bailey (1976) in Hortus III listed the species names as <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux for white sweetclover, and <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> (L.) Pall.  for yellow sweetclover. The yellow species was termed <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> Lamarck by Duke (1981), but Munz (1973) called it <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> (L.) Lamarck.  Metcalfe (1985) listed the approved names for white sweet clover as <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux and for yellow sweetclover, <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> [L.] Lamarck.  The annual form of white sweetclover was called <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux var.  <I>annua</I></B> Coe by Bugg and Ellis (1990).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>Yellow sweetclover tolerates 3-6 mmhos of salinity (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>White sweetclover is unusually susceptible to a number of herbicides, especially 2,4D (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>In the north, mowing or grazing biennial white sweetclover during the first year prevents good root growth (Duke, 1981). Grazing, and presumably, mowing can begin once plants have attained a height of 20-25 cm.  For the biennial forms of the white species, mow during bud stage (before flowering).  Hay yields the first year range from 2.2-3.5 Mg/ha, and in the second year 2.2-8.1 Mg/ha.  In India, the annual form ('Hubam') can yield 9-10.5 Mg/ha in three cuttings.<P> Duke (1981) related that yellow sweetclover matures 10-14 days earlier than biennial white sweetclover.  First-year top growth should be removed before August or after mid October, either by mowing or grazing.  Grazing (or presumably, mowing) can begin when the stand height is from 20-25 cm, and frequent removal is needed to prevent forage from becoming coarse and unpalatable. Yields of cv 'Madrid' can be 4.2-4.5 Mg/ha in the first year, and 5.5-8.5 Mg/ha in the second.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>As related by Duke (1981), white and yellow sweetclovers are insect pollinated; pollination triples the seed set obtained for yellow sweetclover without pollination.  For both species, 2-5 colonies of bees per acre are recommended, but 25 per acre gives maximum pollination.  White sweetclover should be harvested for seed just as the pods turn black or dark brown.<P> Annual white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') was avoided by one farmer because of its tendency to reseed (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>White sweetclover should be harvested for seed just as the pods turn black or dark brown (Duke, 1981).  Yellow sweetclover is best harvested if windrowed when damp and threshed 4-5 days later with a combine having a pickup attachment.  The binder or combine should be set high.<P> If the companion grain crop of sweetclover is to be harvested the first year, set the binder on the combine high (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Mouldboard plough, rotavator, tandem disc, offset disc, and heavy duty cultivator were evaluated as tools for incorporating yellow sweetclover prior to spring wheat planting.  There were no significant differences due to implement for amount of soil nitrogen in the 0-60 cm profile (Foster, 1990). If the companion grain crop of sweetclover is to be harvested the first year, set the binder on the combine high (Duke, 1981). Yellow sweetclover is best harvested if windrowed when damp and threshed with a combine having a pickup attachment 4-5 days later.  The binder or combine should be set high (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Sweetclover is often seeded together with a nurse crop of some small grain (Duke, 1981).  During establishment, sweetclovers may benefit from a companion crop of oat (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> Goldstein (1989) wrote that in the northern Great Plains, yellow sweetclover is useful when grown in combination with a brome grass or a winter-hardy orchard grass like cv 'Pierre.' This is better than a solid stand of yellow sweetclover for both soil improvement and grazing.  Such a mixture could be grazed or stubble mulched by undercutting the plants and leaving the residue on the surface. This approach to tillage leads to better water infiltration and efficiency of nitrogen use in the following grain crops than does plowing.<P> Sweetclovers may be interseeded into rows of squash or overseeded into brassicas, but they are not suitable for overseeding into corn (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers as cover crops give poor weed control (Schonbeck, 1988).  White sweetclover is small seeded and rather slow to establish.  Problems with weeds should be expected (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Sweetclovers may benefit during establishment from a companion crop of oat (Schonbeck, 1988) or some other small grain (Duke, 1981).<P> Annual white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') was avoided by one farmer because of its tendency to reseed (Schonbeck, 1988).<P> In early May in an organic vineyard at Hopland, Mendocino County, California, fall-seeded mixed biennial white and yellow sweetclovers had a vegetational cover of 41.25+/-13.29 % (Mean +/- S.E.M.), which was significantly less than the cover afforded by most annual cover crops.  A mid-May harvest of weeds (mainly chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass) from the sweetclover plots yielded a total weed biomass of 3.274+/-0.562 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which is 66.6% of the figure obtained from weedy control plots (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds of white sweetclover have hard testa and must be scarified to speed germination (Duke, 1981).<P> Seeds of yellow sweetclover occur one or two to the pod and are smooth, ovoid-elliptical, 1.5-3 mm. long, ca 1.5 mm broad, and yellow or greenish-yellow, sometimes with purple spots.  Seeds are said to poison horses (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Workers</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers are tall and may interfere with workers (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD><I>Melilotus</I></B> spp.  are not true clovers, which are <I>Trifolium</I></B> spp. (Taylor, 1985).  Bailey and Bailey (1976) in Hortus III listed the common names for <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux as being white sweetclover, white melilot, and Bukhara clover and for <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> (L.) Pall., yellow sweetclover, melilot, yellow melilot, and melist. According to Duke (1981), the common names for <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux are white sweetclover, Hubam, and white melilot; for <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> Lamarck, the common name is yellow sweetclover.<P> McLeod (1982) gave as common names for the white species, white sweet clover and Bokhara sweet clover, and for the yellow species yellow sweet clover, official melilot, and common sweet clover.<P> Metcalfe (1985) listed several common names under the general heading of sweetclover, including annual yellow sweetclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B> All.), Banat sweetclover (<I>Melilotus dentata</I></B> [W.  & K.] Pers.), yellow sweetclover (<I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> Lamarck or <I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> [L.] Lamarck), white sweetclover (<I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Medik. or <I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux), Daghestan sweetclover (<I>Melilotus suaveolens</I></B> Ledeb.), Israel (Hubam) sweetclover (<I>Melilotus alba</I></B> var. <I>annua</I></B> Coe), and sourclover or sour sweetclover (<I>Melilotus indica</I></B> All.).<P> The approved common and scientific names for the two species treated here are white sweet clover (<I>Melilotus alba</I></B> Desrousseaux) and yellow sweetclover (<I>Melilotus officinalis</I></B> [L.] Lamarck) (Metcalfe, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that 'Hubam' annual white sweetclover grown as a green manure could add about 80 kg N/ha.  The review by Bugg et al.  (1991c) listed white sweetclover as containing 80 - 180 kg N/ha.  Bundy et al.  (No date) wrote that sweetclover can contain from 80-120 lb N/acre.<P> During a three-year study in Saskatchewan (Foster, 1990), above-ground nitrogen yields for yellow sweetclover at 15 July (following establishment by overseeding into standing wheat during late April or early May the previous year) were 26, 52, and 65 kg/ha.  Mouldboard plough, rotavator, tandem disc, offset disc, and heavy duty cultivator were evaluated as tools for incorporating yellow sweetclover prior to spring wheat planting. There were no significant differences due to implement for amount of soil nitrogen in the 0- 60 cm profile.  Three dates of incorporation were evaluated for incorporating yellow sweetclover prior to spring wheat planting: June 15, July 1, and July 15. June 15 incorporation gave the best result in terms of the amount of soil nitrogen in the 0-60 cm profile (59, 66, and 70 kg/ha in the three years of the study), and for grain yield of the wheat (Foster, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed maturation of yellow sweetclover as occurring in the autumn, and 10-14 days before biennial white sweetclover. Annual white sweetclover (cv 'Hubam') was avoided by one farmer because of its tendency to reseed (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers may facilitate P availability to subsequent crops (Schonbeck, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>White sweetclover tolerates from 0.9-16.0 dm of precipitation, with the mean of 54 cases being 7.8.  The corresponding figures for yellow sweetclover are 3.1-16.0 dm of precipitation, with the mean of 54 cases being 7.8 (Duke, 1981).<P> Sweetclovers grow well where annual rainfall exceeds 17 inches, suitably distributed throughout the year, and often persist in areas too dry for alfalfa.  Yellow sweetclover withstands drier conditions than white (McLeod, 1982).<P> Zachariassen and Power (1991) found that crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  White sweetclover showed intermediate values.<P> Goldstein (1989) wrote that principal considerations in drought-proofing a farm on the northern Great Plains are: (1) improving soil structure through integrated use of grasses, (2) integrating animals with grain-farming operations, (3) effective management of yellow sweetclover, (4) stubble mulching to improve infiltration of water, and (5) timing tillage to have maximum positive impact on soil improvement.  Yellow sweetclover is useful when grown in combination with a brome grass or a winter-hardy orchard grass like cv 'Pierre'.  This is better than a solid stand of yellow sweetclover for both soil improvement and grazing.  Such a mixture could be grazed or stubble mulched by undercutting the plants and leaving the residue on the surface. This approach to tillage leads to better water infiltration and efficiency of nitrogen use in the following grain crops than does plowing.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>Crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C. Sweetclover showed intermediate values (Zachariassen and Power, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that the biennial form of white sweetclover has a deep taproot and relieves soil compaction.<P> As reported by Wen-Cheh et al.  (1989), leguminous cover crops cause acidification of soils.  In the long run and in the absence of liming, this could lead to downward leaching of cationic nutrients and a decrease in base saturation.  In terms of mg of H+ produced per g of nitrogen fixed, experiments in hydroponic tanks indicated a rating of red clover = crownvetch > alfalfa = white sweetclover.  Extrapolations based on commonly-encountered field production values suggested that the amounts of acidity produced per year per hectare would be 4.2 to 9.4 kg for red clover, 5.2 to 14.0 kg for alfalfa, 4.5 kg for crownvetch, and 4.6 kg for white sweetclover.<P> Crimson clover showed a consistently-higher water use efficiency (g of dry matter produced per liter of water evapotranspired) than hairy vetch at 10, 20, and 30C.  Sweetclover showed intermediate values (Zachariassen and Power, 1991).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>For yellow sweetclover, the seed leaves (cotyledons) are very small, twice as long as broad, and pale green.  The first true leaf is heart shaped or roundish, and wavy around the edges.  The second and subsequent true leaves are trifoliate (Fischer et al., 1978).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) mentioned various tolerances of sweetclovers, but did not list shade tolerance.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Sweetclovers may benefit from being sown along with a small grain as companion crop (Duke, 1981).  Sweetclovers tolerate heavy grazing (Duke, 1981), which may suggest that they tolerate close mowing as well.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Vertebrates</B>
<DD>The sweetclovers contain coumarin, an anticoagulant. (See Effects on Livestock.)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that the following nematodes have been isolated from white sweetclover: <I>Belonolaimus gracilis</I></B>, <I>Ditylenchus dipsaci</I></B>, <I>Heterodera glycines</I></B>, <I>H. trifolii</I></B>, <I>Meloidogyne hapla</I></B> <I>M.  javanica</I></B>, <I>Paratylenchus projectus</I></B> <I>Pratylenchus penetrans</I></B>, <I>P. pratensis</I></B>, <I>P.  vulnus</I></B>, and <I>Tylenchorhynchus martini</I></B>. On yellow sweetclover, the following nematodes were found: <I>Heterodera glycines</I></B>, <I>H.  trifolii</I></B>, <I>H. schachtii</I></B>, and <I>Meloidogyne hapla</I></B><P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that white sweetclover is attacked by 48 fungi, the bacterium <I>Phytomonas lathyris</I></B>, and cucumber mosaic, ringspot, and "Steinklee" viruses.  Twenty-one species of fungi attack yellow sweetclover, as do 11 types of virus.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>The Southern Seedsmen's Association (1990) listed 18 suppliers of white and 18 of yellow sweetclover.  Cv 'Hubam' was unobtainable in the autumn of 1990 (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>

<H1>On-farm Research &amp; the Transition</H1>
<P>
<I>by Jill Shore Auburn &amp; Robert Bugg SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Many growers and researchers are frustrated that the University
of California isn't able to answer all of their questions about
how to make the transition to more sustainable farming practices.
 California agriculture is being asked to change so quickly and
so dramatically, that there isn't time for researchers to study
every question scientifically.  What's a farmer to do?<BR>
<P>
The most successful farmers carefully observe differences among
fields and patches on their own farms, and continually experiment
with different methods in small plots before adopting them on
a whole field.  They usually don't need complicated experimental
designs and sophisticated statistics to tell them what works for
them. Some attention to plot layout according to the basic principles
of experimental design can often be helpful, however.
<H3>The Three R's of On-Farm Research</H3>
<P>
Experimental design and statistics are often presented as something
only academics understand and care about.  The terms for different
designs (randomized complete block, split-plot, Latin Square)
and the alphabet soup of statistical formulas (t's, R-squared's,
F's, and p's) sometimes seem more important than the reasons we
use them.<BR>
<P>
There are three basic concepts of experimental design that everyone
should use in even the most casual on-farm experiments:   <I>replication,
randomization, and reasonableness.</I>
<H3>Replication</H3>
<P>
No one looks at a particularly lush field and draws conclusions
about its management without considering background factors such
as soil, water and local climate.  Whenever you try a new method
on a single plot, and draw a conclusion by comparing that single
plot with its neighbor, you are running the risk of being fooled.
 If you have several experimental plots treated the same (replicates),
interspersed with other plots treated differently, you can gauge
how much of the difference in a single plot is due to the treatment,
as opposed to inherent variability among plots.  Of course, each
of several treatments must be represented by multiple plots (replicates).
 For example, if you wanted to compare the effect of cover crops
vs. manure on soil, you would need several plots treated with
cover crops and several plots treated with manure.  Most statistical
formulas compare variability within treatments (that is, among
plots treated the same) to variability among
<P>
treatments (plots treated differently).  Even without a statistical
measure, you can tell a lot by looking at replicated plots:  If
plots with the same treatment are very different from one another,
you'd want to see a much bigger difference between them and your
&quot;conventional&quot; plots before concluding that the treatment
made a difference.  There is no way you can make this judgment
with a single plot.  The lack of replication is one of the reasons
that the conclusions of older studies are often called into question.
<H3>Randomization</H3>
<P>
If you lay out several plots of each treatment, you should do
so in a way that doesn't influence the results.  Particularly
if there is (or might be) an environmental gradient of some sort,
such as changing soil type or a row of trees that shades one end
of the plots more than another, you should lay out the plots in
a way that spreads them out over the gradient, rather than having
all of one type of treatment near one end of the gradient.  Breaking
the entire area into several blocks, and then assigning one treatment
to a plot in each of the blocks by flipping a coin, drawing straws,
or some other randomization procedure, is the safest way to proceed.
Randomization ensures that the plots will be interspersed in a
way that removes the influence of any gradients.<BR>
<P>
<I>Example of poor (unrandomized) and better (randomized) experimental
plot layout with three treatments, A, B, and C. (Jill Shore Auburn)</I>
<H3>Reasonableness</H3>
<P>
Randomization and replication are the basics of experimental design,
but they don't substitute for evaluating the reasonableness of
the result before &quot;betting the farm&quot; on it.  If something
seems to have worked, are there other possible explanations? 
Is there anything else that you did inadvertently to make the
treated plots work but differently from the others?  Repeating
an experiment in a different field, and/or next year, can help
to ensure that you're not misled by circumstances that year, or
conditions in that field.<BR>
<P>
Besides using these principles of experimental design in your
own on-farm research, you can use them to evaluate the claims
of consultants, salespeople, and neighbors.  Someone may try to
sell you on a practice or a product based on positive results
elsewhere.  You can ask questions about how well the results were
replicated, and whether the conclusions being drawn are reasonable
or likely to be the result of conditions peculiar to another farm
or situation.  If the results weren't based on a replicated trial
and repeated from one year to the next, it doesn't necessarily
mean that they're wrong.  It means you should use caution and
preferably experiment on a small scale with some replication before
you believe the results.
<H3>Basic Statistics</H3>
<P>
In most cases, on-farm studies involve one or more in-dependent
variables, and one or more dependent variables.  The independent
variables are the factors that the experimenter applies (at various
levels) to determine whether any of the independent variables
causes a significant effect on the dependent variable. Variables
can be either qualitative or quantitative.  For example, if compost
is applied to an orchard at ten different rates, that is a quantitative
variable.  If one is comparing conventional to organic production
systems, this variable is qualitative. Different species of cover
crops are also distinguished qualitatively.  Most dependent variables
of interest to farmers can be measured quantitatively. For example,
yield, cull rates, pest incidence, insect or earthworm densities,
and soil organic matter can usually be assessed as quantitative
variables.<BR>
<P>
The aim of most statistical tests is to judge whether the independent
variables do a better job of predicting the dependent variables
than does the overall average.  The type of test that is generally
used to make this judgment depends on whether the independent
variable is quantitative or qualitative.<BR>
<P>
If both the dependent and independent variables are quantitative,
the appropriate type of statistical test is called regression
analysis.  This does not mean a &quot;Shirley MacLaine-like&quot;
reading of your past lives.  What it does mean is a test for some
type of linear relationship between the variables, in which the
slope is significantly different from zero.  For example, increasing
levels of fertilizer might cause increased yields.<BR>
<P>
If the independent variables are qualitative and the dependent
variable is quantitative, the appropriate type of statistical
test is analysis of variance, abbreviated ANOVA.  ANOVA tests
whether the individual levels of each independent variable do
a significantly better job of predicting the observed data than
would the overall average.<BR>
<P>
Whether regression or ANOVA is used, the resulting statistic is
interpreted using p-values:  p is the probability that the observed
differences in means are due to chance.  Therefore, a low value
of p indicates a high likelihood that there is a real effect (more
than just chance) of the independent variable on the dependent
variable.  If p is less than or equal to 0.05 (5 percent probability
that the results are due just to chance), the result is usually
called &quot;statistically significant.&quot;
<H3>Calculation Aids</H3>
<P>
Suitable statistical software is available for both MSDOS and
Macintosh computers that make the calculation of these statistics
much easier, so that grower-users can be free to concentrate on
the meaning of the statistics rather than on how to calculate
them.  Reviews of statistical software are available in computer
journals.<BR>
<P>
There are few examples of California farmers conducting on-farm
research that would satisfy university scientists.  An organization
called Practical Farmers of Iowa founded by <B>Richard and Sharon
Thompson</B>, however, does promote on-farm research.  This organization
has produced a primer offering guidelines for other growers to
do simple but effective research design.  (To obtain a copy of
&quot;A Farmer's Guide to On-Farm Research&quot; send $4.50 [includes
postage and handling], to Richard and Sharon Thompson, Rural Route
2, Box 132, Boone, IA, 50036-9632.)<BR>

<H1>SAREP Project Updates</H1>
<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
Two years after the alar apple scare, three SAREP projects are
comparing organic and conventional apple production systems. 
Farm advisors in Santa Cruz, Contra Costa and Sonoma counties
are working with researchers and farmers to find out what is required
of farmers in the transition from conventional to organic production
systems.  &quot;Three projects in three geographic areas will
give us some sense of grower and climatic variability in dealing
with this crop,&quot; said <B>Bill Liebhardt</B>, SAREP director.
<H3>Santa Cruz</H3>
<P>
<B>Sean Swezey</B>, UC Santa Cruz Agroecology Program, is coordinating
a project in Watsonville in a Granny Smith orchard.  He said first
year results have shown that growers should have a very good idea
of their soil and climate conditions before starting the conversion
to organic production.  His group found that organic growers must
pay even more attention to accurate integrated pest management
forecasting indicators (orchard traps, degree day dates) than
conventional growers, in order to make cost-effective use of non-chemical
pest control methods like granulosis virus to combat codling moth.
 Swezey also said there is much to learn about tree growth, nutrient
supply and weed suppression in certified organic production.
<H3>Sonoma</H3>
<P>
Farm Advisor <B>Paul Vossen</B> is coordinating the Sonoma County
project, which had higher levels of codling moth damage than did
Swezey's cooler-climate experiment. Codling moths have three flights
(generations) in warmer Sonoma County compared to two in Watsonville,
which makes a big difference in control, Vossen said.  Vossen
noted that fruit size and yields were about the same in organic
and conventional test plots that did not have major codling moth
damage.  Vossen said limited use of pheromone (sex hormone) confusants
proved to be a more effective codling moth control technique than
oil and <I>Bacillus thuringiensis </I>(Bt) and will be more widely
used in the next growing season.
<H3>Contra Costa</H3>
<P>
<B>Janet Caprile</B>, Contra Costa County farm advisor, reiterated
what Swezey said about the need to carefully observe biological
indicators.  &quot;It's so important to time exactly,&quot; she
said.  &quot;We found three-week discrepancies in monitoring techniques,
which is not acceptable.  It makes it difficult to use the products
effectively.&quot;  The
<P>
Contra Costa County orchard was hit by four moth flights. The
Contra Costa County researchers have seen differences m organic
sprays.  The most effective biological control organism for them
was the granulosis virus, with the Bt and oil combination second
most-effective.  Ryania spray (a ground-up root) was less effective
than either granulosis or Bt and oil, but more effective than
nothing, Caprile said.  She is doing the comparison study on 30
acres of Granny Smith and Fuji apples, in an orchard of 250 acres
of conventional production.  She said it is hard to tell if the
biological controls will have a cumulative positive effect on
the apple trees, and will be looking for indications in the coming
growing season.  She noted that when there is an untreated control
section in the middle of an orchard it increases codling moth
pressure throughout the orchard.<BR>

Sometimes grown as a warm-season cover crop in alternation with vegetable crops</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>McKee et al.  (1946) recommended broadcasting at 20-40 lbs/acre, or seeding in wide (3.5 ft) rows at 5-7 lbs/acre. McLeod (1982) recommended 35 to 40 lbs/acre.  According to Yost and Evans (1988), sowing rates vary from 25 to 90 kg/ha; within this range, broadcast rates are higher than for drilling. Higher densities lead to prolonged stem succulence.  High sowing rates are recommended if the crop is to be grown only for four to five weeks.  When incorporation is to be after six to 8 weeks, seed 35-40 kg/ha broadcast or 30-35 kg/ha drilled are adequate.  For seed production, lower rates are used.<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), the common names of <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> are sunnhemp, Indian hemp, Madras hemp, brown hemp, and sannhemp.  Other names applied include sunn hemp (McLeod, 1982), and sunn (Burton and Martinez, 1980).<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is a tall, herbaceous, shrubby annual, with erect fibrous stems reaching a height of from 1-3 m (Duke, 1981), or six feet, according to Miller et al.  (1989).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD>The scientific name is <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> L.  (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>In an experiment conducted in India, sunnhemp yielded more nitrogen than five other legumes, including cowpea, which was the second highest.  At eight weeks of growth, these two legumes yielded the same quantity of green cuttings.  Nevertheless, cowpea may be preferable as a green manure because it is more leafy and less fibrous (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>This species is listed as drought tolerant yet reported as receiving irrigation every 10-15 days when cultured for fiber (Duke, 1981).  Reports from Davis, Yolo County, California suggest that pre-irrigation (planting to moisture) and one subsequent irrigation are all that is required for a 60-day green manure (Van Horn, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>No specifications were available for sunnhemp, but <I>Crotalaria spectabilis</I></B> is sown at 3/4 inch depth (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>No information is available on sunnhemp, but for the congeneric <I>C. spectabilis</I></B>, seeds remain viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Crotalaria juncea reaches a maximum hieght of between 1-3 m (Duke, 1981; Yost and Evans.  1988).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) mentioned that sunnhemp tolerates soil pH from 5.0-8.4, with the mean of 24 cases being 6.2.  The species tolerates moderate alkalinity, but soil acidity below pH 5 appears to reduce growth on manganiferous Oxisols (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>The species is not tolerant of salinity, according to Duke (1981), although Yost and Evans (1988) claimed that moderate soil salinity is tolerated.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD><I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> seedlings are tender and susceptible to mechanical damage.  This may restrict its use as a relay intercrop where field operations would occur at this stage (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is a short-day plant, although the cultivar 'T6' is day neutral (Duke, 1981).  Flowering occurs in from 100-108 days, but in India, intervarietal difference in maturation date can be as great as 10 weeks (Duke, 1981).  In Davis, Yolo County, California, flowering has occurred during August and September (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Plants remain succulent until six to eight weeks after sowing, at which time flowering begins and stems begin to lignify (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>This is the fastest-growing species in its genus (Duke, 1981). In tropical areas, maturity may be reached in four months or more (Yost and Evans, 1988). Intervarietal difference in maturation date can be as great as 10 weeks (Duke, 1981).  In Davis, Yolo County, California, flowering has occurred during August and September (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Plants remain succulent until six to eight weeks after sowing, at which time flowering begins and stems begin to lignify (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is grown for its fiber, which makes durable twine, rope, rug yarn, paper, etc.  It is also used as a green manure and and as forage (Duke, 1981).<P> Various species of <I>Crotalaria</I></B> can grow on infertile soils, do not harbor pest nematodes, and are good at adding N; thus, they are good soil improvers (McKee et al., 1946).<P> Like sesbania or cowpea, in northern California, sunnhemp can follow crops such as early sweet corn and early processing tomatoes, or precede fall-planted crops such as vegetable brassicas and cereal grains (Miller et al., 1989).  The genus is especially good on nematode-susceptible soils in rotation with truck crops and for reducing damage to peach trees (McKee et al., 1946).<P> <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> is the species most widely used as <I>in situ</I></B> green manure for upland crops in the tropics (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P> As a green manure (McLeod, 1982), it grows rapidly in height and can be used as an intercrop amid maize or sugarcane (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P> <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp.  are often used as green manure in tung groves (an Asian tree whose seeds yield a drying oil).  Crotalaria spp. can be intercropped or rotated with peanuts, truck crops, and corn.  One of the best soil-improving practices is to plant crotalaria in spring in small grain and allowing it to continue after the grain has been harvested (McKee et al., 1946).<P> No species of crotalaria is used extensively as forage (McKee et al., 1946), but hay of <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> is fed to livestock (Duke, 1981).  Seeds are fed to pigs and horses, although said to be poisonous (Duke, 1981).<P> Lack of seed has limited use of sunnhemp in the U.S.A.  (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>This is a tall herbaceous shrubby annual, 1-3 m tall, with vegetative parts covered with short, downy hairs, taproot long and strong with many well-developed lateral shoots and numerous branched, lobed nodules up to 2.5 cm in diameter.  Stems are up to 2 cm in diameter.  Flowers are bright yellow and showy (Duke, 1981).  Plants branch at about 75 cm above the ground when not crowded, but branching is higher and sparser when grown in the high populations favored for green manure or fiber production (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the species as being native to India and Pakistan, and it is now cultivated throughout India, as well as in Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Brazil.  It is native to the Cool Temperate Steppe to Tropical Very Dry through Tropical Wet Forest Life Zones. Most species of crotalaria are tropical or subtropical in their requirements, as recounted by McKee et al. (1946).  McKee et al. (1946) also wrote that <I>C.  juncea</I></B> has failed to mature in experiments in Maryland.  Under irrigation in the Southwestern States, several species have been tried.  <I>C.  spectabilis, C. mucronata</I></B>, and <I>C.  juncea</I></B> have made fair growth but establishment is difficult. Seedings must be made after the threat of frost, and the quick drying and baking of soil interferes with seedling emergence . <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> is best adapted to the tropics and subtropics, and has given good results in U.S. experimental plantings (McLeod, 1982).  It grows best at elevations below 300 m (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Duke wrote that the plant tolerates mean annual temperatures from 8.4 to 27.5 degrees C with the mean of 29 cases being 22.5. Warm temperatures with moderate humidity are best (McKee et al., 1946).  Growth may be slowed by cool seasons (Yost and Evan, 1988), and the plant is susceptible to frosts (Miller et al., 1989), with 28 F the minimum tolerated without injury (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is a summer annual (Yost and Evans, 1988).  It is the fastest growing of its genus, and is good at smothering weeds. Vegetative growth is favored by long days, with flowering induced by short days for most varieties. In India, the variety 'T6' is day neutral.  In Zimbabwe, the species flowers during July and August (Duke, 1981).  Seed set may be poor (Duke, 1981).  In the continental U.S., <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp.  are treated as summer annuals (McKee et al., 1946).  In California, the species is fast growing as a cover crop; like sesbania, and cowpea, it can make rapid growth during short 60 to 90 day summer growing periods (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD><I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> or cultivars thereof are said to tolerate laterite and poor soil (Duke, 1981).  In general, according to McKee (1946), the genus tolerates poor, sandy soils. On more fertile soils it grows better, but other crops can be grown there.  <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp.  need good drainage and do not do well on heavy clay; most soils of the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern states are suitable (McKee et al., 1946).<P> <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> does best on well-drained acid soils (McLeod, 1982; Miller et al., 1989) and does not grow as well as sesbania on low, wet lands (McLeod, 1982).  Yost and Evans (1988) agreed that the species is adapted to lighter, well drained soils, although good growth is obtained on heavy soils during dry periods; poorly drained soils are the major limitation, although constant wet weather is detrimental to growth on any soil type.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>According to McKee et al.  (1946), seeds of <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp.  remain viable for a number of years.  Deterioration is slow and gradual, unless during or subsequent to harvest the seed has been scarified, that is scratched to aid germination.  Once the seed is, scarified, deterioration is much more rapid, but even then it remains viable for several years under good storage conditions. The percentage of hard seed is high.  Since threshing with an ordinary thresher may scarify only 40% of the seed, about 60 % or more hard seed will ordinarily remain in untreated seed and this will produce volunteer growth in cultivated fields for a number of years without reseeding.  The weight of crotalaria seed is about 60 lbs.  per bushel.<P> For <I>C.  juncea</I></B>, there are approximately 15,000 seeds/lb, according to McKee et al.  (1946), and 33,000 seeds/kg according to Duke (1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>Because the percentage of hard seed is high for <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp., seed should be scarified or scratched to aid germination. Commercial seed scarifying machines are available in the trade. The abrasives used in their construction usually are sandpaper, emery cloth, or sandstone.  A small concrete mixer can be used as a scarifier by first adding to the seed coarse stones the size of marbles or larger.  If the concrete mixer is rotated for about 1 hour with stones and seed in equal bulk, reasonably good scarification should be effected. This method of scarification is described in Dept.  of Agriculture, Leaflet 107, The Barrel Seed Scarifier.  The scarified seed can be easily separated from the stones by screens (McKee et al., 1946.).<P> McKee et al.  (1946) stated that seed of <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp.  is comparatively small, so thorough seedbed preparation is necessary for the first seeding to ensure a prompt and good stand. Subsequent volunteer stands require only disking to reduce weeds and. Crotalaria does well in cultivated fields either as a first crop or volunteer.<P> Seedings can be made broadcast or drilled.  In drilling, the rows can be close, as with small grains, or wide, as with corn and sorghum.  Rows can be wide when seed is limited or it is desired to control weeds by cultivation. They also may make seed harvesting by hand easier (McKee et al., 1946).<P> Scarification of seeds is unnecessary for some varieties (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is said to be tolerant of laterite and poor soil and is grown in India without any special fertilization (Duke, 1981). The species is mentioned as less demanding of soil fertility than is cowpea (Miller et al., 1989).  In general, <I>Crotalaria</I></B> spp. tolerate infertile soils and have been much used on sandy soils. Continued production on sandy, infertile soils requires the addition of superphosphate and potash for other crops in the rotation (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>According to McKee et al.  (1946), for maximum growth on prepared seedbeds, seeding should be done after all danger of frost is past, about the same time as corn planting or a little later. Earlier seeding is advisable in oat or other small grains.  When planted early under such conditions, the seed becomes covered and is ready to grow by the time the weather is warm.<P> Use of a combine in harvesting the grain will be facilitated if time of seeding is delayed so as to reduce the height of the plants (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Inoculant type "EL" (Nitragin Co.) is appropriate to this and other species of <I>Crotalaria</I></B> (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 1981).  Wherever planted in the U.S., Crotalaria has made good growth and developed many nodules so that artificial inoculation seemed unnecessary to McKee et al.  (1946); other researchers have stated that inoculation is probably a good idea because it generally improves N-fixation potential (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that sunnhemp hosts 20 types of plant-parasitic nematode.  McKee et al.  (1946), however, noted that the genus does not harbor nematodes and is, therefore, good in rotation with nematode-susceptible crops and at reducing nematode damage to peach trees.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp is reported as tolerant of weeds and is very effective at shading them out (Duke, 1981).  This probably relates to the six-foot high canopy providing dense shade late in the growth cycle of the plant (Miller et al., 1989). Nonetheless, sunnhemp will not choke out Bermuda grass because the latter grows all summer, whereas the former produces dense shade only during the late summer after Bermuda grass has already had half a season's growth (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>When crotalaria is seeded along with a small grain and continues to grow following the harvesting of the grain, allow the crotalaria to mature some seed each year to ensure subsequent volunteer stands.  Alternatively, one could occasionally allow a crop to mature fully.  Crotalaria grown with corn should be seeded several weeks before the corn is laid by, or it may be volunteered from a previous crop.  In most seasons, this allows enough time for some seed to mature and ensure subsequent volunteer stands (McKee et al., 1946).<P> After a good seed crop is obtained, reseeding is assured.  The quantity of seed that matures before frost varies from 200 to 500 lbs/acre.  Light frosts do not kill crotalaria.  After the first year, even the complete loss of 1 year's seed crop does not greatly affect volunteering because sufficient hard seed remain for 2 years (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>When intercropping with a small grain, crotalaria seed is broadcast during February or early in March amid the young grain at the rate of about 25 lbs/acre.  A drag (spring-tooth?) harrow or weeder can then be used to incorporate the seed.  The grain will mature late in spring or early in summer and can be harvested with binder and combine when the crotalaria plants are a few inches high.  Crotalaria plants then grow rapidly in the stubble and by October are 4-6 feet high.  If crotalaria is allowed to mature seed for reseeding, subsequent grain crops must be seeded late.  An early strain of <I>C.  spectabilis</I></B> is often desirable, permitting earlier sowing of the grain (McKee et al. 1946).<P> In rotation with corn, seed several weeks before corn is laid by or use a volunteer stand from seed derived from a previous crop. This usually allows some seed maturation to ensure subsequent volunteer stands.  When corn follows crotalaria that was allowed to mature seed or crotalaria was seeded early in the season, 8 to 10 tons of cover crop may ultimately be obtained.  Crotalaria overseeded at the time of laying by the corn sometimes failed because of the late start.  Carry-over seed germinates as soon as cultivation is stopped and makes satisfactory growth (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Seed yields have exceeded 2.25 Mg/ha for HA-6 selected at the USDA Plant Materials Center on Molodai, Hawaii (Yost and Evans, 1988).  World-wide seed yields range from 500-1,000 kg/ha of seed (Duke, 1981).  McKee et al.  (1946) cited seed production as 200 to 500 lbs/acre, but the species, although blooming freely, usually sets very little seed.  Seeds are seldom produced in California, because of long days during summer (Miller et al., 1989).  Seed production is difficult in the subtropics, where days short enough for flowering occur during unfavorable winter months (Yost and Evans, 1988).  In the United States, seed is obtained in commercial quantity only from southern Texas (McKee et al., 1946; Yost and Evans, 1988).<P> In the tropics, flowering can begin at six weeks, with maturity reached at four months or more.  Seed pods do not dehisce in the field, so seed may be combine-harvested when mature and dry. Hand harvesting and threshing are easy. Seed yields of over 2.25 Mg/ha have been recorded with the accession HA-6 selected at the USDA Plant Materials Center on Molodai, Hawaii (Yost and Evans, 1988.)<P> Shortage of seed has prevented <I>C.  juncea</I></B> from being commonly used (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Sunnhemp can produce between 12.5 and 14 Mg/ha of dry above-ground biomass (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Harvesting is by combining, mowing, or hand-picking.  Some species ripen seed fairly uniformly, and these are best suited for handling with machinery. In Texas, July-sown <I>C.  juncea</I></B> made about half as much growth as when planted early, and it matured seed which could be easily harvested with a combine. Crotalaria can be threshed when dry but is difficult before fully mature. Threshed seed must be dried artificially or spread thinly on shed floors to dry.  Heating seed reduces germination. Hand-harvested seed pods can be gathered and spread to dry before being hulled or threshed.  Special crotalaria threshers have been built, but ordinary threshers can be adjusted satisfactorily. Screens and ordinary fanning mills can be used to clean seed (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Seed has been difficult to obtain due to negligible production in the continental U.S.; the principal source during the early 1990's has been Hawaii (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>For maximum immediate N yield for subsequent vegetable crops, crotalaria should be plowed under in its early stages of growth, when the nitrogen concentration is high and decomposition rapid. If gradual availability of N will suffice, as in an orchard, incorporate mature crotalaia as tree growth begins in spring (McKee et al., 1946).<P> The bud or early flowering stage is preferred for ploughdown. Early incorporation is prefered to risking overmaturation where wet soils are likely to preclude field operations.  In dry regions, irrigation may be advisable prior to incorporation.  One incorporation method is mowing, then disking and plowing before the material dries.  Alternatively, the standing crop may be plowed after laying down the crop by "planking" or light disking in the direction to be plowed (Yost and Evans, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>The suitability of sunnhemp as forage is an area of controversy. According to McKee et al.  (1946), species of crotalaria reported as poisonous to livestock include <I>C. spectabilis, C.  juncea, C. burkeana, C.  dura,</I></B> and <I>C. sagittalis</I></B>.  On the other hand, Yost and Evans (1988) asserted that <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> has been found non-toxic to livestock, unlike most congeners. Palatability may be a limitation, and multiple use of the crop as a fodder source requires further investigation.  Duke (1981) noted that hay is fed to livestock, and seeds to pigs (in Zimbabwe) and horses (in Russia) although seed are said to be poisonous (Duke, 1981).<P> USDA grain standards limit the amount of sunnhemp seed allowed in grain crops.  (D. Cohen pers. comm. to Mark Van Horn.)<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that sunnhemp is attacked by 38 species of fungi, 6 bacteria, 8 viruses, and 3 parasitic plants.  No widespread disease epidemics have been reported in farmers' plantings (McKee et al., 1946). Damping-off caused by <I>Rhizoctonia solani</I></B> may be damaging during cool, wet weather in spring (McKee et al., 1946).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No information is available on <I>C.  juncea</I></B>, but <I>Crotalaria spectabilis</I></B> is sensitive to herbicides, particularly 2,4-D (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>The taproot of <I>Crotalaria juncea</I></B> is long and strong (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), there are several types, including 'Madaripur,''Serajganaj,' 'Bhadai san,' 'Rabi san,' 'Somerset,' kharif, rabi, 'T6,' 'Cawnpore 12,' 'Kharif sunn,' ' Beldanga Early,' and 'Ullapora.'<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>In discussing tolerances of sunn hemp, Duke (1981) did not mention shade.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Cost is $3.50 to $4.00 per pound.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Seedlings emerge after three days and form a thick cover (Duke, 1981).  Only under optimum conditions, planted thickly (i.e. with a grain drill.)  (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Plants grazed at 6 to 12 inches height produced many lateral branches but never fully recovered compared to ungrazed plants. (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.)<P>

<H1>Apple Transition Meeting<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A one-day meeting in Watsonville November 17 presented growers
with production and marketing information for making the transition
to certified organic apple production. The meeting was sponsored
by the Committee for Sustainable Agriculture, California Certified
Organic Farmers (CCOF), Santa Cruz County Cooperative Extension,
and the Agroecology Program of UC Santa Cruz.<BR>
<H3>Prevention</H3>
<P>
<B>Steve Gliessman</B> of the Agroecology Program began the morning
with an overview of the transition process. &quot;Organic tools
for cleaning up problems don't work as well as conventional tools,&quot;
he said, &quot;so preventive measures are much more important.&quot;
Establishing a cover crop to compete with weeds and to provide
habitat for beneficial insects is one important preventive strategy.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Bob Cantisano</B> of Organic Ag Advisers discussed soil fertility
from non-synthetic sources. Organic matter is the key, he said,
and earthworms are the physical evidence of a biologically active
soil. Purchased organic materials may be useful during the transition
(based on a tissue analysis), but after two or three years the
most cost-effective system is to &quot;grow your own&quot; nutrients
with a nitrogen-fixing cover crop, he said.<BR>
<P>
<B>Richard Smith</B>, San Benito County farm advisor, elaborated
on the topic of cover crops. According to Smith, cover crop benefits
include improved water infiltration, erosion and insect control,
weed suppression, and nematode inhibition. Potential drawbacks
include competition for water and nutrients, increased pests of
some kinds (e.g. rodents, ants), difficulty of controlling noxious
weeds, and increased frost risk, he said. Cereals provide good
growth in cool weather, but residue may be a problem if they are
not mowed or incorporated early. Properly inoculated legumes provide
nitrogen and decompose quickly when turned under, but put on growth
mainly in the warmer weather of spring, he added. Mustards put
on rapid, early growth and are easily incorporated, but are not
recommended for apples because they harbor orange tortrix (apple
skinworm).<BR>
<H3>Insect Pests</H3>
<P>
Insects pests were discussed first by <B>Sean Swezey</B> of the
Agroecology Program. He is comparing conventional and transitional
management in replicated plots in a commercial orchard of Granny
Smiths. The orchard is in its first year of transition. The Pajaro
Valley study site has low codling moth pressure due to its cool,
maritime climate, Swezey said. After one year, the conventional
and transitional plots have approximately the same leaf area and
leaf and fruit damage from codling moth or other insects, he said.
The organic plots had a somewhat heavier crop made up of a greater
number of smaller apples, since chemical thinning was not used.
<BR>
<P>
IPM Area Advisor <B>Carolyn Pickel</B> described control measures
for several insect pests. Codling moth and apple scab are usually
the worst pests in organic apple orchards, she said, while orange
tortrix is often the biggest problem in conventional orchards.
Monitoring is the key to codling moth control, so that treatment
with a narrow-range oil can be timed exactly at egg laying, Pickel
said. The Environmental Protection Agency will likely restrict
the use of oil for air pollution reasons, however, so growers
should be cautiously experimenting with natural oils such as cottonseed
oil, she noted. Because cottonseed oil can be phytotoxic (harmful
to plants), growers should experiment to find out safe levels
for their particular varieties and conditions, Pickel said. Frequent,
aggressive codling moth control is important in the early years
of transition because once it builds to high levels it can be
difficult or impossible to control organically, she said.  <B>Lyn
Garling</B> of the Agroecology Program, described various monitoring
methods for codling moth, including cardboard bands around tree
trunks in conjunction with two kinds of experiments: male confusion
with pheromones (not very successful in their first trial) and
parasitic nematodes (very successful).<BR>
<H3>Management Timing</H3>
<P>
Santa Cruz County Director <B>Ron Tyler</B> gave an overview of
orchard management by seasons. After harvest, organic fertilizers
should be applied (if used), and cover crops should be planted.
Apples need only about 60 lbs/acre/year of nitrogen fertilizer,
although growers may want to apply somewhat more in the first
few years of transition to account for the slower release from
organic sources, Tyler said. He said research is needed to provide
better information on the degradation of organic materials under
California conditions, noting that too much nitrogen will cause
bitter pit. A cover crop can supply all the nitrogen that is needed;
Tyler recommends a barley/vetch mixture, or any similar legume
and grass. He said he would like to see CCOF allow zinc sulfate
treatment without prior leaf analysis, because it often shows
up visually in tree tops but not in leaf samples from lower leaves.
Winter pruning can aid in thinning and help to prevent alternate
bearing: Prune lightly after a heavy crop, and heavily after a
light crop. Tyler said thinning is the most costly operation for
organic growers, especially for fresh market. At green tip stage,
he suggested using lime sulfur for scab and mildew, and begin
pest monitoring. At pinkbud stage, Tyler recommended applying
the second lime sulfur treatment and, if the cover crop is blooming,
mowing or disking it so that it won't compete with the trees for
bees. Thinning is important to control crop size, and also helps
with worm control, since codling moth and apple skinworm like
spots between two apples, he said. Unless growers are trying to
avoid tillage, Tyler said summer irrigation and disking are important.
Rototilling is less desirable than disking, as it causes a very
severe plow pan if soils are wet, he noted. Leaf analysis from
non-fruiting spurs in July or early August is mainly to determine
nitrogen and potassium levels. Harvest offers a second chance
(after thinning) to sort for quality, Tyler said. Rapid cooling
of harvested fruit (not to be confused with cold storage which
is too slow) can help reduce postharvest bitter pit, he noted.
<BR>
<H3>Growers Talk Transition</H3>
<P>
Growers <B>Jim Rider, Bill Denevan, </B>and<B> Robert Stephens</B>
described their experiences with the transition process. They
agreed that organic production was very difficult in areas of
high codling moth pressure, and that maintaining a clean orchard
with a strong program is easier than rehabilitating an abandoned
orchard. A strong pest management program may be expensive, however,
cautioned Denevan, who has been able to grow organically for ten
years because he's &quot;always looking at the bottom line.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
<B>Tony Scherer</B> of Ocean Organics, and <B>John Battendieri</B>
of Santa Cruz Natural Company, discussed marketing. The Alar crisis
last spring created product shortage and skyrocketing prices which
have not been maintained, they said, but the trend in both fresh
and processed organic is rising. Organic prices are generally
more stable than conventional, according to Scherer. The future
looks very good, he said, even though it may be rocky in the short
term: The forecast of a million boxes of organic apples from Washington
looks like a lot in the traditionally small organic marketplace,
but it is a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; in the overall marketplace,
and organic growers need to supply large, reliable volumes in
order to convince chain stores to carry their produce.<BR>
<P>
<B>Betty Emlen</B>, the local CCOF certification chair, ended
the day with a description of the certification process. CCOF
Executive Director <B>Bob Scowcroft</B> described the political
scene for organic production, including organic legislation being
developed at both state and national levels. <BR>

Seldom used as cover crops in California</UL><DL><P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Lupins are excellent accumulators of "unavailable" phosphorus for future crops, according to Peaceful Valley (1988).  Wheat intercropped with white lupin has access to a larger pool of phosphorus, manganese, and nitrogen than wheat grown in monoculture; the former two nutrients were probably mobilized of by exudates from the lupin roots, then taken up by the closely-associated wheat roots (Gardner and Boundy, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) gave seeding rates as follows: white lupin: 56-180 kg/ha; blue lupin: 65-90 kg/ha: yellow lupin: 45-80 kg/ha. Peaceful Valley (1988) suggested 2-4 lb per 1000 sq ft or 80-125 lb/acre.<P> Henderson (1989) investigated the effects of sowing density of blue lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> L.  cv 'Illyarrie') following a wheat crop (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.  cv 'Gutha') on a compacted, earthy sand soil. Lupin population densities were established over a range of from 25 to 200 plants per m2. High-density plantings of lupin were better able to alleviate compaction, although lupin biomass declined with indensity increased.  Peak biomass production was about 260 g/m2; as density increased, biomass declined about 25%.  The reduced soil compaction was apparently due to the increased numbers of taproots penetrating the soil.  The contribution to improved wheat yield by the decreased copmaction was estimated to be about 100 kg/ha.  In comparison to improvements due to nitrogen fixation and breakage of disease cycles, this contribution is minor, but it could be important on compacted sandplain soils.  Other benefits of high stand densities include reduced erosion and crop disease, and better weed control and harvesting.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Lupin flowers are attractive to bees and beneficial insects, according to Peaceful Valley (1988), and Duke (1981) mentioned lupins as important honey plants.  Bugg et al.  (1990) studied 20 cool-season cover-cropping regimes and evaluated associated insects for 17 of these regimes in southern Georgia. Convergent lady beetle (<I>Hippodamia convergens</I></B> Guerin-Meneville]) and seven-spotted lady beetle (<I>Coccinella septempunctata</I></B> [L.]) first were found in substantial numbers on rye, then on crimson clover and lentil, later on subterranean clover, still later on a low-alkaloid cultivar of narrow-leafed (blue) lupin (cv 'SNLL-87') (which harbored high densities of thrips [<I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp., Thysanoptera: Thripidae]), then hairy vetch, and lastly on mustard and collard.  Insidious flower bug (<I>Orius insidiosus</I></B> [Say]), an important predatory insect that attacks numerous agricultural pests, was abundant on several dates on narrow-leafed lupin, hairy vetch (in monoculture and in biculture with annual ryegrass), and lentil.  A low-alkaloid strain of narrow-leafed lupin ('SNLL-87') was the only one that harbored high densities of leaffooted bug (<I>Leptoglossus phyllopus</I></B> [L.]), a pest of row, field, and orchard crops. Therefore, this strain of lupin should be used with care as a cover crop.<P> A subsequent study (Bugg, unpublished data) showed that adult leaffooted bug survived significantly longer when caged in on low-alkaloid strains of blue lupin than on alkaloid-rich (bitter) strains.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) summarized biomass production for the three principal economic species: white: 5.0-7.5 Mg/ha, but production can be as high as 10 Mg/ha; blue: 5-7.5 Mg/ha, but values ranging from 7.5-12.5 Mg/ha are reported in India; yellow lupin: 5-7.5 Mg/ha, with root biomass ranging from 3-8.7 Mg/ha. As related by Larson et al.  (1989), white lupin cv 'Buttercup' produced 9.14 Mg/ha during 1986-1987, whereas cv 'Multolupa' during 1985-1986 produced 15.44 Mg/ha and in 1986-1987, 10.64 Mg/ha, and cv 'Ultra' in 1985-1986 produced 11.63 Mg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Lupins are strongly and deeply taprooted (Peaceful Valley, 1988; R.L.  Bugg, pers. comm.).  The roots of yellow lupin can penetrate to a depth of 2 m in dernopodzolic sandy loam soils of Russia, with a root biomass yield of yellow lupin of from 3-8.7 Mg/ha (Duke, 1981).  Gardner et al.  (1982) found that white lupin could acquire P through acidification of the rhizosphere and subsequent absorbtion.  This can lead to enhanced uptake of P, Mn, and N by intercropped of wheat.  The former two nutrients were probably mobilized of by exudates from the lupin roots, then taken up by the closely-associated wheat roots (Gardner and Boundy, 1983). Gardner, W.K., D.G.  Parbery, and D.A. Barber. 1982.  The acquisition of phosphorus by <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> L.  I. Some characteristics of the soil/root interface.  Plant and Soil 68:19-32.<P> Hartmann and Aldag (1989) compared white lupin cv 'Eldo' with faba bean cv 'Herz Freya' on five sites.  White lupin developed a deeper root system than did faba bean.  In the soil stratum of from 60-90 cm depth, white lupin (cv 'Eldo') root mass was 6 times that of faba bean (cv 'Herz Freya').  Overall root mass was 125 g/square meter for stands of white lupin vs 86 g/square meter for faba bean.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>White lupin produces some 800-1,000 kg/ha of seed; blue lupin, 500-600 kg/ha, and yellow lupin, 800-1,000 kg/ha (Duke, 1981). For white lupin, non-shattering cv's lead to less loss of seed; also, defoliants are typically applied prior to harvest. Harvesting is best done under fairly cool conditions, leading to less shattering and seed damage; a normal header type harvester is used in Australian production (Duke, 1981).<P> For white lupin cv 'Eldo,' seed yield was 48-450 g/m2 (Hartmann and Aldag, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that white and blue lupins or varieties thereof are tolerant of weeds, whereas yellow lupin is deemed susceptible.  The alkaloids of white lupin are said to act as a natural herbicide when the crop residue decomposes in the soil.<P> Based on an account from Spain, principally concerning white lupin, herbicides are required in the culture of sweet <I>Lupinus</I></B>, yields of which are otherwise severely reduced by weeds (Posuelo et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>Blue lupin is intolerant of even low levels of 2,4D herbicide (Duke, 1981). Based on an account from Spain concerning white lupin, herbicides are required in the culture of sweet <I>Lupinus</I></B>, yields of which are otherwise severely reduced by weeds (Posuelo et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>"Lupin" can refer to any member of the genus <I>Lupinus</I></B>. (Bugg, pers. comm.).  Various species are used in agriculture, including blue lupin or narrow-leaved lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> L.) (Duke, 1981), European yellow lupin (<I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> L.) (Duke, 1981), white lupin (<I>Lupinus albus</I></B> L.) (Duke, 1981), and Spanish lupin (<I>Lupinus hispanicus</I></B> ssp. <I>bicolor</I></B> cv 'Bicolor') (Bugg, pers. comm.). Munz (1973) listed 82 species as occurring in California, of which the native annual <I>Lupinus bicolor</I></B> Lindley is sometimes used as a vineyard cover crop (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Lupins were listed as cold tolerant by Peaceful Valley (1988), but cold tolerance varies among species, biotypes, and cultivars.<P> Based on the account by Duke (1981), frost tolerance in descending order is white lupin > blue lupin > yellow lupin.  Based on observations in Tifton, Georgia, the cultivar 'Bicolor' or Spanish lupin shows better frost tolerance than does blue lupin (John Miller, pers. comm.).  White lupin tolerates mean annual temperatures of from 5.7-26.2 C, with a mean of 38 cases of 12.7) temperatures of -6 - -8 C are harmful at germination and -3 - -5 C is harmful during flowering (Duke, 1981).  White lupin requires a 5-month period with mean monthly temperatures ranging from 15-25 C, with the optimum being 18-24 C (Duke, 1981).  Blue lupin tolerates mean annual temperatures of from 5.6-26.2 C, with the mean of 39 cases being 12.3 (Duke, 1981).  When vegetative, it tolerates temperatures as low as -6 C, and has a lower germination threshold than do other economic lupins (Duke, 1981).  Yellow lupin tolerates mean annual tempteratures of from 6.6-26.2 C, with the mean of 42 cases being 13.0 C (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Uses of lupins were summarized by Duke (1981).  Bitter lupins are typically used for green manuring alone, whereas alkaloid-free varieties are also used for forage and silage.  Blue and yellow lupins are mentioned as good honey plants.  Yellow lupin is a major grain crop in in the Baltic countries.  Seed of bitter strains of white lupin can be cleansed of alkaloids by soaking or boiling in water.<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Lupins will thrive in areas with more than 15" rainfall, according to Peaceful Valley (1988).  Duke (1981) listed the precipitation requirements of the three principal economic lupins as follows: white: 3.6-17.8 dm (mean of 38 cases, 8.4 dm [optimal is 4-8 dm]); blue: 3.5-16.6 dm (mean of 39 cases, 8.4); and yellow: 3.5-20.9 dm (mean of 42 cases, 8.5).  White lupin is the most tolerant of waterlogging of the three species, but is nevertheless listed as intolerant of this condition (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>The three principal economic lupins are grown mainly as winter annuals in the southeastern U.S. (Duke, 1981).  Peaceful Valley (1988) suggested sowing from September thru November 15.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) gave seeding depths for white lupin as 2.5-5.0 cm and stated that cultivation techniques are similar for blue and yellow lupins.  Peaceful Valley (1988) gave the seeding depth as 1".<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the pH tolerances of the three principal economic lupins as follows: white: 4.8-8.2 (mean of 35 cases, 6.4); blue: 4.9-8.2 (mean of 12 cases, 6.6); and yellow: 4.5-8.2 (mean of 41 cases, 6.5).  White lupin is native to acid soils and also tolerant of mildly-acid to slightly-calcareous soils.  Blue lupin is adapted to mildly-acid to neutral soils. Yellow lupin is adapted to strongly to mildly acid soils.<P> Hartmann and Aldag (1989) reported that faba bean (cv 'Herz Freya') showed delayed nodulation where soil pH was low but that white lupin (cv 'Eldo') showed no decrease in N-fixation.  White lupin cv 'Eldo' was compared with faba bean cv 'Herz Freya' and soybean cv 'Gambit' on five sites.  White lupin showed no decrease in N2-fixation at pH < 5.5.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) presented values for N contents of white, blue, and yellow lupins; all were stated to range from 250-450 kg N/ha. Duke (1981) indicated that yellow lupin roots could accumulate 147-160 kg N/ha.  However, Peaceful Valley (1988) stated that lupins are moderate N fixers (40-75 lb N/acre).<P> Based on a study by Hartmann and Aldag (1989), faba bean (cv 'Herz Freya') showed delayed nodulation where soil pH was low, whereas white lupin (cv 'Eldo') showed no decrease in N-fixation. 'Eldo' was compared with faba bean cv 'Herz Freya' on five sites. White lupin showed no decrease in N2-fixation at pH < 5.5. Nitrogen gain after seed harvest was 8 g/m2 for both white lupin and faba bean. Nitrogen fixation rates at different locations were approximately as follows: white lupin in 1986: 30, 360, 280, 120, and 240; and in 1988: 20, 250 230, 290, 330 kg/ha2.<P> Larson et al.  (1989) gave N data on white lupin cv's as follows: (1) 'Buttercup': N in whole plant, 1986-1987: 275 kg/ha, 215 (78%) from fixation, 90.9% in seed, biomass: 9.14 Mg/ha; (2) 'Hamburg': N in whole plant, 1986-1987: 279 kg/ha, 219 kg/ha (78%) from fixation: 258 kg/ha, 87.8% in seed, biomass 11.06 Mg/ha; (3) 'Multolupa': N in whole plant, 1985-1986: 345 kg/ha, 247 kg/ha (72%) from fixation, 79.4% in seed, biomass: 15.44 Mg/ha; 1986-1987: 258 kg/ha, 197 (76%) from fixation, 85.7% in seed; biomass 10.64 Mg/ha; (4) 'Ultra': N in whole plant, 1985-1986: 286 kg/ha, 193 (90.9%) in seed, biomass: 11.63 Mg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>The three principal economic lupins take the "H" strain of <I>Rhizobium lupini</I></B> (Duke, 1981; Nitragin Company, Inc., No Date).  Peaceful Valley (1988) stated that proper inoculation is essential for successful lupin crops.<P> Lupin is usually inoculated with <I>Rhizobium lupini</I></B> WU425, but this strain is susceptible to the fungicide iprodione with which lupin seed are treated to protect the plants from a foliar pathogen, <I>Pleiocheata setosa</I></B>.  Another strain of <I>R. lupini</I></B>, CC606B was much more tolerant of the fungicide but did not nodulate lupin as well.  A soil spray of WU425 could be used to inoculate fungicide-treated lupin, but farmers seem not to use this practice.  Based on regression analysis, dry matter and seed yields showed a trend (P=0.075) toward an inverse relationship (Evans et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>White lupin requires higher soil fertility than do blue or yellow lupins and is susceptible to P deficiencies (Duke, 1981). Blue lupin is suceptible to deficiencies of P, K, and Co.  Yellow lupin is susceptible to Fe and Mn deficiencies on basic or neutral soils but tolerates high Al concentrations (Duke, 1981).<P> White and Robson (1989) stated that lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea. However, this is not due to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture.<P> Barrow and Mendoza (1990), in reporting on an experiment concerning a study of crop yields in response to P levels, stated that sigmoid yield responses to increasing levels of a nutrient (in this case, P) suggest that there is a lower threshold concentration below which plants cannot take up the nutrient, and diminishing returns to further addition of the nutrient above an upper threshold.  Trials with freshly-applied vs.  incubated phosphate using a yellowish brown loamy sand (pH 5.6) showed markedly sigmoid response curves for subterranean clover (cv 'Yarloop') and narrow-leafed lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B>), but not for <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> or <I>L.  luteus</I></B>.  The results suggest that the lupins (especially <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B>) grew better than subterranean clover at low phosphorus concentration. At low levels of phosphate application, roots of subterranean clover were heavily infected with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae; infection but no arbuscules were detected with the lupins.  Previous studies had suggested that responses of subterranean clover to added phosphorus are not sigmoid in the presence of mycorrhizal fungi.  Findings of the present study are contrary to this.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>According to Peaceful Valley (1988), lupins can tolerate any soil except heavy adobe soils with standing water in winter.<P> A summary of Duke's (1981) accounts of lupin soil adaptation follows.  White lupin is adapted to well-drained, fertile, neutral loams, and moderately-acid to calcareous sandy loams or loamy sands, and is intolerant of waterlogging (although more tolerant than either blue or yellow lupins).  It is tolerant of salinity. Blue lupin is said to be tolerant of sand, and of high pH, and is adapted to neutral to moderately-acid sandy loams or loamy sands. Yellow lupin tolerates strongly to mildly acid infertile soils. In its native range, it grows on acid sandy loams.<P> White and Robson (1989) stated that lupins suffer iron deficiency when grown on calcareous soils, much more so than does field pea. However, these researchers found that this is not due to a lesser ability to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+, as shown with studies of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>The deep taproots of lupins can open and aerate soil, according to Peaceful Valley (1988).  A similar improvement was demonstrated in Henderson's (1989) study of effects of sowing density of blue lupin (<I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> L.  cv 'Illyarrie') on a following wheat crop (<I>Triticum aestivum</I></B> L.  cv 'Gutha').  The experiment was conducted on a compacted, earthy sand soil, and blue lupin population densities were established over a range of from 25 to 200 plants per m2. High-density plantings of lupin were better able to alleviate compaction, although lupin biomass declined with density increase. Peak biomass production was about 260 g/m2; as density increased, biomass declined about 25%.  The alleviation of compaction was apparently due to the increased numbers of taproots penetrating the soil.  The contribution to improved wheat yield was estimated to be about 100 kg/ha.  In comparison to improvements due to N fixation and breakage of disease cycles, this contribution is minor but could be important on compacted sandplain soils. Other benefits of high stand densities include reduced erosion and crop disease, and better weed control and harvesting.<P> Gardner et al.  (1982) found that white lupin could acquire P through acidification of the rhizosphere and subsequent absorbtion. This can lead to enhanced uptake of P, Mn, and N by intercropped of wheat; the former two nutrients were probably mobilized of by exudates from the lupin roots, then taken up by the closely-associated wheat roots (Gardner and Boundy, 1983).<P> When grown on calcareous soils, lupins suffer more from iron deficiency than does field pea (White and Robson 1989). However, studies by these workers of field pea, <I>Lupinus anugustifolius</I></B> and <I>L.  cosentinii</I></B> in solution culture indicated that this is not due to to a lesser ability of the lupins to acidify the root zone or to an incapacity to reduce Fe3+.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) mentioned that <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> includes high- and low-alkaloid varieties, and listed varieties 'Hope' and 'Egyptian.'<P> For <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B>, Duke (1981) mentioned the the sweet varieties 'Borre,' 'Blanco,' 'Frost,' and 'Rancher.'  Bitter varieties include cv 'Richy.'  Other varieties not listed as to alkaloid content were 'Unicrop' and 'Uniharvest.' For <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B>, Duke (1981) listed the cultivars 'Florida Speckled,' and the low-alkaloid and non-shattering varieties 'Weiko II,' and 'Weiko III.'<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) wrote that <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> seed are 3-6 per pod, 8-14 mm mm in diameter, orbicular-quadrangular, compressed or depressed, smooth, and dull, light yellow, sometimes with dark variegation, and 3,308 seeds/kg.<P> Per Duke's (1981) account, <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> seeds occur 3-7 per pod, are ellipsoid to subglobose, smooth and dull, 6-8 mm long, yellow-brown, dark brown, or gray with yellow spots; there are 5,513 seeds/kg.<P> According to Duke (1981), European yellow lupin (<I>Lupinus luteus</I></B>) seed are 4-6 per pod, 6-8 mm long, 4.5-7.0 mm broad, orbicular-quadrangular, compressed, smooth and dull, black marbled white  with a white curved line on each side or all white, and the species has 8,820 seeds/kg.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD><I>Lupinus albus</I></B> and <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> show phanerocotyledar germination (Duke, 1981).<P> <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> cotyledons are yellowish; stipules are absent (Duke, 1981).<P> Seedling emergence and growth are quite sensitive to cold temperatures and wet soil conditions.  (Mark Van Horn, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> is a short-hairy annual up to 120 cm tall; leaflets of lower leaves 25-35 mm long, 14-18 mm wide, of upper leaves 40-50 mm long and 10-15 mm wide, obovate-cuneate, all mucronate, nearly glabrous above, sparsely villous beneath; stipules setaceous; racemes 5-10 cm long, seesile, flowers alternate; calyx 8-9 mm long, both lips shallowly dentate; corolla white to blue, 15-16 mm long; fruit flattened, 60-100 mm long, 11-20 mm broad, becoming longitudinally rugulose, short-villous, glabrescent, yellow.<P> Per Duke's (1981) description, <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> is a short-hairy annual 20-150 cm tall; leaflets 10-50 cm (<I>sic</I></B>, probably means 10-50 mm) long, 2-5 mm wide, linear to linear-spathulate, glabrous above, sparsely villous beneath; stipules linear-subulate; racemes 10-20 cm long; upper lip of calyx aboutt 4 mm long, 2-dentate, lower lip 6-7 mm long, irregularly 3 dentate to subentire; corolla 11-13 mm long, blue, occasionally pink, purple, or white; legume shortly hirsute, yellow to black, to 6 cm long, 1.5 cm broad.<P> Duke (1981) described <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> as a hairy annual 25-80 cm tall, the stems hairy; leaflets 40-60 mm long, 8-12 mm wide, obovate-oblong, mucronate, sparsely villous; stipules dimorphic, those of the lower leaves 8 mm long, subulate, those of upper leaves 22-30 mm long, 2-4 mm wide, linear-obovate; racemes 5-16 cm long, flowers verticilllate, scented (violet-scented); petals bright yellow; legume 4-6 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide, densely villous, black.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> is probably derived from wild forms on the Balkan Peninsula, and it is widely cultivated in the Mediterranean region, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Upper Nile.  It is occasional in central and southeastern Europe.<P> Per Duke's (1981) description, <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> is native to the Mediterranean Basin and southwestern France.  It has been introduced and is now widely grown in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, South Africa, northern Europe, and the southeastern U.S.<P> Duke (1981) described <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> as native to the Mediterranean Basin from the Iberian Peninsula and Italy through the Islands of the Meditteranean to the Middle East and Israel.  It has been introduced and is cultivated in northern Europe, South Africa, Australia, and the southern U.S.<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), some forms of <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> are tolerant of saline soils, and others are not.<P> Some Yugoslavian forms of <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> are said to tolerate maritime sands (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>All three of the commercially-used species, <I>Lupinus albus</I></B>, <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B>, and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B>, are annual plants (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>In areas with mild winters, <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> is usually seeded from mid September to late October 56-180 kg/ha (Duke, 1981).  A grain drill can be used, or seed can be broadcast and disked to incorporate (Duke, 1981).  <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> are cultured similarly, but seeding rates are 65-90 kg/ha and 45-80 kg/ha respectively (Duke, 1981).<P>

<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD><I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> are both long-day plants; flowering of the latter is also affected by vernalization, but the relative importance is not known (Duke, 1981).<P> According to Duke, <I>Lupinus albus</I></B> flowers from May-June, <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> from April-June, and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B>, March-July.<P>

<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD><I>Lupinus albus</I></B> is a short-hairy annual up to 120 cm tall; <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> is a short-hairy annual from 20-150 cm tall, and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> is a hairy annual from 25-80 cm tall (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD><I>Lupinus albus</I></B> is up to 120 cm tall; <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> is from 20-150 cm tall, and <I>Lupinus luteus</I></B> is from 25-80 cm tall (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>For <I>Lupinus albus</I></B>, seeding with the first rains of autumn or dry seeding apparently leads to the best results because of the rapid growth lupins while the weather is still warm, and the resultant improved competition with weeds (Duke, 1981).  <I>Lupinus angustifolius</I></B> is less tolerant of infertile soils than are other lupins.<P>

<H1>Project Update: Fruit Decay Organisms in Hot Water<BR>
</H1>

<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels SAREP<BR>
</I>
<P>
for an effective nonchemical method of controlling decay and physiological
disorders of fruit after harvest. A team of researchers, led by
Elizabeth Mitcham in the Pomology Department at UC Davis, was
funded for $11, 730 by SAREP in 1993 to examine the effects of
prestorage hot water dips on fruit quality. Hot water showed promise
decades ago, but chemical treatments proved to be cheaper and
more effective. Now, many chemicals maybe unavailable for use
in postharvest treatments because of public pressure to reduce
The search is now on chemical use and because many organisms have
developed resistance to these materials. Controlled atmosphere
(CA) storage, in which the carbon dioxide level is raised and
the oxygen level is reduced in storage, can be very effective
but is expensive. <BR>
<BR>
The Experiments. The hot water treatments in this study were aimed
at reducing several diseases and disorders in stored fruit: storage
scald (apples), brown rot (peaches, nectarines, and apricots),
mealiness (peaches and nectarines), chilling injury (stone fruits
and persimmons), and Botrytis rot (kiwifruit). Results of the
research on storage scald and brown rot are presented here. <BR>
<BR>
Storage Scald of Apples. Apples are injured by prolonged storage
at low temperatures. With apple storage scald, surface cells are
killed, causing an irregularly shaped, diffuse browning of the
skin. The researchers want to know if the hot water dips can effectively
replace diphenylamine (DPA), a commonly used antioxidant for the
control of storage scald. <BR>
<BR>
In the first year of the study, 'Granny Smith' apples were immersed
for 5 minutes in hot water at 46 or 50 degrees C and stored in
1/2-degree C air for three or six months. Hot water-immersed fruit
had only minor scalding after three months compared to the untreated
controls, which were dark brown. After six months, however, more
scalding occurred and the fruit showed some yellowing. Virtually
no scalding occurred on fruit stored under CA storage. Other fruit
quality indicators were not adversely affected by the treatments.
Interestingly, the development of bitter pit, another physiological
disorder which results in brown sunken lesions on apples, was
also significantly reduced by heat treatments. The most promising
treatments after three months of the second year study were 48
degrees C for 15 minutes and 50 degrees C for 5 minutes. Mitcham
noted that results after six months will indicate whether the
technique merits promotion or further study. <BR>
<BR>
Brown Rot. Brown rot is a serious disease of stone fruits in storage.
To test the effects of hot water on brown rot control, the researchers
dipped fruit in 52 degree C water for 2 minutes (apricots) or
2 1/2 minutes (peaches). The fruit was then stored at 5 degrees
C and then at room temperature, both for varying lengths of time.
With the apricots, heat treatment usually resulted in lower disease
incidence and severity for both inoculated and noninoculated fruit.
Similarly, brown rot on peaches was greatly reduced, however,
some skin browning did occur as a result of the heat treatment.
<BR>
<BR>
Limitations.  Mitcham acknowledges that she would find herself
in &quot;hot water&quot; if she suggested that this method alone
will replace chemicals. Unlike many chemicals, she notes, hot
water treatments do not leave a residue for prolonged control.
The potential for extended storage is therefore dependent on the
degree of sanitation and other conditions after the dip. Hot water
can also reduce storage life if fruit injury occurs, as noted
above. &quot;The challenge is that there is a fine line between
control and injury,&quot; Mitcham says. Energy costs are also
an issue, but Mitcham believes that some of the heat produced
during the cooling process could be diverted to heat the water
baths. <BR>
<BR>
Mitcham and her colleagues have been awarded a second year of
funding from SAREP to refine the hot water treatment techniques.
<BR>
<BR>
Industry Response. According to Mitcham, hot water baths are already
practiced for decay and insect control on oranges, mangoes, and
papayas. However, she has encountered widely varying reactions
from growers and handlers of temperate zone fruits. &quot;Responses
range from great interest and excitement to extreme skepticism,
mostly because growers have always been told to cool the fruit
as quickly as possible after harvest,&quot; she says. &quot;The
idea of heating the fruit first takes some getting used to.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Chemicals have been the cornerstone of postharvest quality in
the past. However, Mitcham believes that probably no single treatment
will provide adequate control of decays and disorders in the future;
it will likely take a combination of techniques. While CA storage
and packaging hold the greatest promise, other methods may include
biological control with yeasts, and increased sanitation and reduced
injury during handling, along with hot water dips.<BR>

<I>Bainbridge, David A.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Article written for <I>Sustainable Agriculture </I>Technical
Reviews.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The field burning of waste straw in California produces more carbon
monoxide and particulates than all of the electric power generating
plants in the state combined. These byproducts of burning have
a significant effect on the quality of air in certain regions
at certain times of the year.<BR>

<P>
During the past decade, many grain farmers in California have
been looking for other ways to manage crop residues. In fact there
are a number of alternatives to field burning. One option is to
incorporate straw back into the soil. Another option is to bale
and remove the straw for some other purpose. This article summarizes
an innovative construction technique that utilizes straw bales.
<BR>

<P>
Straw bale construction is one of the best building systems known.
Straw bale construction began in the late 1800s in the Nebraska
Sandhills, a vast grassland area with few trees. This method of
building proved to be durable and more comfortable than either
wood frame or sod houses. A straw bale renaissance is currently
underway, led by builders and pioneers who have rediscovered the
benefits of this low cost, durable, and super energy-efficient
building material.<BR>

<P>
Straw bales have been used to build houses, apartments, farm buildings,
schools, hotels, government buildings, and churches. Many buildings
more than 50 years old are still in &quot;like-new&quot; condition,
loved by their occupants, and unrecognized by passers-by. These
include two churches, a post office, and a county courthouse.
This building method is particularly attractive for farm structures
in areas where straw is a waste material available at low cost
(this includes the Sacramento Valley, Willamette Valley, and the
area around Couer de Lane, Idaho). Bale prices as low as $1 per
bale are found in rural areas - but even at suburban prices it
makes sense to build with bales.<BR>

<P>
This is perhaps the only ecologically and economically sound building
system. Homes can be &quot;grown&quot; in sustainable agroecosystems
without pillaging the old growth forests, at owner-built prices
competitive with mobile homes (now the home of approximately 16
million Americans.)<BR>

<P>
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (the equivalent of
the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development) sponsored a technical
report that concluded, &quot;The basics of this technique can
be learned in a few days. A two week practical training is sufficient
to teach all intricacies related to this construction method.
These factors make it a well suited self-help building method
for people with limited resources.&quot;<BR>

<P>
These Canadian tests also verified the fire safety and structural
integrity of plastered straw bales. &quot;The straw bales/mortar
structure wall has proven to be exceptionally resistant to fire.
The straw bales hold enough air to provide good insulation value
but because they are compacted firmly they don't hold enough air
to permit combustion.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Material costs represent less than one-fifth of the cost of the
wall system so owner-builders can realize greater savings by providing
their own labor. These structures also lend them selves to work
parties because unskilled labor is needed. Several houses have
been built for less than $10 per square foot by combining several
other cost saving techniques with the low cost super-insulated
bale walls.<BR>

<H3><B>Building Options</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Structural Use of Bales</B>. Bales should be compact for structural
use. Dry straw bales are preferred (rice, wheat, rye, oats, etc.).
Three-wire bales at about nine to ten pounds per cubic foot are
good. If bales are bought directly from the baler both full and
half bales should be ordered. The bales are laid flat (like bricks)
and pinned with hardwood dowel or rebar pins set at an angle and
vertical in the corners. Joints are staggered to provide additional
strength.<BR>

<P>
<B>Non-Structural Infill</B>. Bales can be used as insulated infill
in timber frame or pole structures to meet building code structural
requirements. However, building a timber or wood frame and then
cutting and fitting bales to fit around the frame adds a considerable
amount to the work and cost. Most bales today are quite strong
and the timber frame is generally an unneeded and unwarranted
expense.<BR>

<P>
<B>Finishes</B>. Temporary buildings can be left exposed (an uncoated
bale wall had held up fine for many years in northern New Mexico
and agricultural buildings often last 20 years if the straw is
protected with snow fence or mesh). One farmer in Alberta has
regularly used unplastered bale buildings for livestock. But in
most case a fire-resistant and water-proof finish is desirable.
Stucco and plaster are commonly used. Gunite or shotcrete (sprayed
concrete) has worked very well on straw bale walls and was used
to finish the State of Texas Demonstration Farm in Laredo, Texas.
This finish goes on quickly and the pressure of the sprayer promotes
an excellent bond with the bales. This is not a do-it-yourself
operation but it is very fast. Asphalt stabilized earth plaster
has been very effective in tests in Arizona. This mix is very
inexpensive (a gallon of asphalt per 30 shovels of adobe mix)
and strong. An evaluation of alternative coatings that can be
sprayed on quickly and economically is needed.<BR>

<P>
The plaster coats are normally reinforced with wire mesh. The
reinforcing wire can be tied to the wall with wire laced between
the bales, wire laid up in the wall, or nailed to stakes pounded
into the bales. Expanded metal lath at corners and around windows
and doors provides additional strength and makes it easier to
plaster.<BR>

<P>
<B>Wiring and Plumbing</B>. Wiring and plumbing can be done as
they are with cement block or adobe buildings. Utilities can be
laid up in the walls as they are built or run in moldings, interior
walls, under the floor, or in the attic. Polypans (used for infiltration
control) can be used to back up the electrical boxes. A chain
saw or wood drill can be used to make room for wire and pipe runs.
Many builders have simply used ROMEX like a normal stud-framed
building.<BR>

<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Seeding rates are given as:<P> (1) 1 to 10 lbs/acre whether solely or with a cereal.  A seeding of 1 lb/acre can yield a solid stand in four or five years.

<DD><I>Trifolium hirtum</I></B> All (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>In general, rose clover recovers well following mowing (McLeod, 1982), and it can be mowed to a height of 2-4 inches throughout the growing season (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Graves et al.  (1986) provided the following provisos: mow at a height of 4 inches during the growing season to control competing vegetation, but allow a 3 to 4 week regrowth period after mowing to set and mature seed.  Early- flowering varieties should not be mowed after late March.  Following seed set in late May, mow at any height to eliminate summer weeds.  The late mowing deposits seed on the soil to permit reestablishment the following fall.<P> Grazing on rose clover, which produces flowers at the ends of stems, must be regulated to keep animals from removing all the flowers (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Rose clover matures in May (Graves et al., 1986), when seed is set (Miller et al., 1989).<P> Miller et al. (1989) listed 'Hykon' as the earliest-maturing cultivar and 'Wilton' as the latest.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Several varieties are available including 'Hykon,' 'Kondinin,' California Common ('Wilton') (Slayback, pers. comm.).  According to Miller et al. (1989), 'Hykon' is the earliest maturing, and 'Kondinin' the most tolerant of soil acidity.  'Wilton' is the latest maturing and adapted to areas with greater than 14" annual rainfall.  Graves et al.  (1986) stated that 'Hykon' and 'Kondinin' (early maturing varieties) did well under San Diego County dryland conditions where 'Wilton' is not recommended.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>According to Duke (1981), rose clover orginated in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern Centers of Diversity, and is native to the western and eastern Mediterrean regions, Balkans, Asia Minor, Crimea, Caucasus, and the Transcaucasus.  It ranges from the Warm Temperate Thorn to Dry through Subtropical Dry to Moist Forest Life Zones.  It tolerates grazing, high pH, low pH, poor soil, and slope.<P> In the U.S., it grows in the southern states and California. (McLeod, 1982), yet it has not been used much for pasture in the southeastern states (Duke, 1981).  In California, rose clover is variously listed as ranging to elevations as high as 3,000 ft. (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986), 3,300 feet. (McLeod, 1982), and 3500 feet (Slayback, pers. comm.).  Munz (1973) reported that rose clover has been cited as a weed in Butte County.<P> 'Hykon' has done well under San Diego County dryland conditions (Graves et al.  1986).<P> Rose clover does best in reseeding stands where broadleaf filaree, <I>Erodium botrys</I></B>, does well (Love, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) lists the pH range as 5.5-8.2, with the mean of 6 cases being 6.8.  Love (1985) gave the range as 5.0-8.3.  Rose clover does well on strongly acid to moderately alkaline soils, but does best if pH ranges between 6 and 7; it is less tolerant of low pH than are subterranean clovers (Graves et al., 1986).<P> 'Kondinin' is the most acid-tolerant cultivar of rose clover (Miller et al., 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) reported that rose clover tolerates a mean annual precipitation of 4.4-11.6 dm, with a mean of 20 cases of 7.0. Apparently due to its greater rooting depth (Love, 1985), it is also said to tolerate drier conditions than subclover (Love, 1985; Graves et al.  1986).  On shallow range soils, rose clover exhausts soil moisture to a depth of about 1 m, preventing the emergence of summer weeds (Love, 1985).<P> According to Murphy et al.  (1976), rose clover can survive with 10 inches of rain annually, but produces better with more. Rainfall requirements are variously given as 10 (McLeod, 1982), 12 (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and >14 inches per year (for cv 'Wilton') (Miller et al., 1989).<P> 
Murphy et al.  (1976) indicated that rose clover cultivars should be able to reseed given the following minimum annual rainfall amounts:<P>
<PRE>
 'Olympus',  10 inches
 'Hykon',    12 inches
 'Kondinin', 12 inches
 'Wilton',   15 inches
</PRE><P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the species as tolerating mean annual temperatures from 14.1-19.7 degrees C, with a mean of 6 cases of 17.4).<P> McLeod (1982) stated that no other introduced legume is as well adapted to such a wide variety of climatic conditions, and paradoxically asserted that the plant is not winter hardy, yet is seldom injured by late spring frosts (McLeod, 1982).<P> Graves et al.  (1986) stated that this species germinates as well as other legumes in cold, fall weather, but is a much better competitor if it is growing well before the cold months of December and January.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Cv 'Olympus' has a prostrate growth habit, whereas 'Hykon' shows semi-erect growth and 'Kondinin' upright growth (Murphy et al., 1976).  Duke (1981) described rose clover stems as 1-4 dm tall and erect or ascending, with branches widely spreading.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Height of rose clover has been variously mentioned as 3 to 18 inches high (Love and Sumner, 1955), 8 to 12 inches in height (Finch and Sharp, 1983; Graves et al., 1986), 1-4 dm (3.94 - 15.75 inches) (Duke, 1981), and 24 inches (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> In Hopland, Mendocino County, California, cv 'Hykon' reached a height in early May of 43.18+/-3.28 cm (17 +/- 1.29 inches) (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Rose clover reseeding is reliable (Graves et al., 1986).<P> Rose clover has a high proportion of hard seed relative to crimson or subterranean clovers, which allows it to dominate formerly-mixed stands following several years of drought (Williams and Elliott, 1960).<P> High temperatures at the soil surface and slightly above were demonstrated to cause breakdown of rose clover impermeability (Williams and Elliott, 1960).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Sow rose clover at 1/2 inch depth (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>The best method for establishing rose clover is by drilling (Slayback, pers. comm.).  A firm seedbed is desirable (Finch and Sharp, 1983), but a minimum of seedbed preparation is required.<P> According to Love and Sumner (1955), disk the field before the fall rains.  After seeding, roll the area with a ring roller, then drill or broadcast the seed.  If rose clover is to be seeded with a cereal, two methods apply: (1) seed the cereal first, then seed the rose clover by airplane; or (2) have an alfalfa drill attached to the grain drill and seed the cereal and clover at the same time.<P> Doves, quail, and robins feed on and disperse the seed of rose clover (Love, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Rose clover may be seeded from September to October 15 (Slayback, pers. comm.); early fall is best (Love and Sumner, 1955; Finch and Sharp, 1983; Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed cost was $0.90/lb in 1988 (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  Fred Thomas (pers. comm.) listed the market retail price for cv 'Hykon' as $2.20/lb in 1993.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Rose clover seed is readily available; the species is grown for seed in California (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Seed yields of rose clover range from 300-500 kg/ha (Love, 1985); seed will develop under unfavorable conditions (Love and Sumner (1955), including low moisture and soil fertility regimes (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Reseeding is reliable (McLeod, 1982; Finch and Sharp, 1983), especially if rose clover allowed 3 to 4 weeks to regrow after mowing to set and mature seed (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> A high percentage of seed is hard (Love and Sumner, 1955).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Rose clover is villous annual legume, with stems 1-4 dm tall, erect or ascending, with branches widely spreading (Duke, 1981). It is an upright branching clover with light-green leaves covered with dense, short hairs, and a 'watermark" of white or reddish-brown, either a spot or a crescent; flowers are rose-colored, globular, with abundant, soft hairs (Murphy et al. 1976).<P> Love and Sumner (1955) described the spreading branches as being densely covered with short, coarse hairs.  As with most true clovers, each leaf has three leaflets at equal distances from the end of the leaf stalk, the center one somewhat larger than the other two.  These leaflets are about the size and shape of those on bur clover, have a scattering of short hairs, over both surfaces, and usually a small, reddish mark a little above the center.  The leaf stalks are from 1/2 to 2 inches long and have hairs like those on the leaflets.  At the bases of the leaf stalks are hairy stipules 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, with smooth margins and ling, tapering points.  The flower heads are rose-colored, spherical, about 3/4 inch across, and profusely covered with stiff, white hairs.  A leaf with somewhat smaller leaflets grows directly from the vase of the flower head, and the stipule of this leaf cups up around the base of the head, as is the case for red clover.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>The seed is yellowish, smooth, a little over 1/16th inch long, and has a scar on the end.  Faint lines on the seed, that meet at the scar end, can be seen with a hand lens (Love and Sumner, 1955).<P> Numbers of seeds per pound for the various cultivars are as follows: 'Hykon' 135,000; 'Kondinin' 165,000, 'Olympus'; and 'Wilton' 140,000 (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> Rose clover, like various other legumes, produces "hard seed," with seedcoats preventing intake of water, and delaying germination for up to several years.  This ensures that the seedbank is not depleted for some time, although weather during successive years may not permit reproduction (Murphy et al., 1976).<P> According to Love (1985), seed remain hard so long as they are held in the dried flower heads.  Some seeds become germinable if the heads shatter and the seed are deposited on the ground.  Many seeds remain impermeable even after passage through grazing animals.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Munz (1973) listed flowering in April and May.  Murphy et al. (1976) stated that 'Olympus' flowers in February, that 'Hykon'flowers 1-2 weeks after Olympus, 'Kondinin' 3-4 weeks after Olympus, and 'Wilton' 5-6 weeks after Olympus.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>Poor performance of rose clover in damp north-coast locales may be due damping-off disease, often caused by <I>Pythium</I></B> fungi (Murphy et al., 1976).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Rose clover is a poor competitor.  Mowing at a height of 2 to 4 inches during winter will control weeds (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P> Bugg et al.  (unpublished data) found that in vineyard plots seeded in October to cv 'Hykon,' above-ground weed biomass the following May was 1.977+/-0.992 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which was 40.2% of the figure obtained in weedy control plots, and was the second highest absolute weed biomass figure observed for the 15 cool-season annual legumes assessed (although the observed differences were not statistically significant).  In the winter-annual legume category, only cv 'Dalkeith' subterranean clover showed a higher absolute weed biomass.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and an annual ryegrass, probably darnel (<I>Lolium temulentum</I></B> L.). In early May, cv 'Hykon' had attained 83.75+/-8.00% (Mean +/- S.E.M.) vegetational cover (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> On shallow range soils, rose clover exhausts soil moisture to a depth of about 1 m, preventing the emergence of summer weeds (Love, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD><I>Meloidogyne incognita acrita</I></B> and <I>M. javanica</I></B> were reported in Duke's (1981) summary.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that fertilizer requirements are minimal for rose clover and that it is tolerant of poor soils.  Rose clover does better on infertile sites than do subterranean clovers (Love, 1985).<P> Applications of superphosphate (300 lbs/acre) increased forage production over 300% and protein content 70% in Placer County trials (Johnson et al., 1956).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Cattle, sheep, and deer graze rose clover even when it is completely dried.  Doves and quail also feed on the plant.  Protein content of rose clover is slightly less than that of bur clover at similar stages (Love and Sumner, 1955).<P> Unlike some varieties of subterranean clover, rose clover contains neligible amounts of estrogens, and no reproductive disorders have been observed in sheep that have been fed it (Love, 1985).<P> Protein content of rose clover is less than for bur clover: 24.9 in lush vegetative stage, 12.6 at flowering, and 8.0 when dead ripe (Williams et al., 1957).<P> Cattle will avoid rose clover when green in favor of subclover or medics or other forages.  (Fred Thomas, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Christensen (1971) stated that for Californian vineyards, French plowing leaves a narrow strip of cover crops in each alley and would permit use of early-maturing species like rose clover. Dates for plowing down cover crops depend on the maturation dates: mid-May for rose clover.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Flowering rose clover harbors abundant minute pirate bug (<I>Orius tristicolor</I></B>), an important beneficial insect (Bugg, pers. comm.), but can also harbor abundant lygus bug (<I>Lygus hesperus</I></B>), a pest of some crops (Rachid Hanna, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>Uses include forage, cover crop, erosion control, and green manure (McLeod, 1982).  Munoz & Graves (1988) recommended rose clover for erosion control, self-seeding forage.  Duke's (1981) account listed range and planting on denuded soil along roadways, dams, and chapparal after fires as the main uses for rose clover. Scott Steward (pers. comm.) includes rose and strawberry clovers in mixtures with various perennial grasses.  These form self-perpetuating or regenerating stands in roadside prairie plantings tested at Hedgerow Farms by John H.  Anderson (pers. comm.).  Doves, quail, and robins feed on and disperse the seed of rose clover (Love, 1985).<P> Rose clover can also be used as a cover crop in orchards and vineyards (Finch and Sharp, 1983).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Due to its greater rooting depth, rose clover is more drought tolerant than subterranean clover (Love, 1985).  The species is taprooted (Slayback, pers. comm.), and the taproot attains depth of up to 2 m (Street, cited in Love, 1985; Love, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>This cool-season annual starts growing in the winter and puts on most of its growth in the spring (Finch and Sharp, 1983), flowering during April and May (Munz, 1973), and seed maturing in May (Finch and Sharp 1983).<P> According to Love (1985), rose clover has a high percentage of hard seed, which remain so as long as seed are retained in the dried flower heads.  Some seeds become germinable if the heads shatter and the seed are deposited on the ground but many remain impermeable even after passage through grazing animals.<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Rose clover is tolerant of a wide range of soil types including infertile soils (Duke, 1981; Miller et al.  1989) but does not endure waterlogging. Sand to loam soils are best (Munoz & Graves, 1988).  It grows "in dry, sterile fields, on slopes, on sandy steppes, on roadsides, in waste places in the Mediterranean region" (Love and Sumner, 1955), and does better on infertile sites than do subterranean clovers (Love, 1985).  Murphy et al. (1976), McLeod (1982), and Graves et al.  (1986) emphasized the importance of well-drained soils.  Rose clover can survive poor, rocky soil and is usually a good forerunner to other clovers on low-fertility soils; it produces well under better soil conditions (Murphy et al. 1976).  No other introduced legume is as well adapted to such a wide variety of soil types, according to McLeod (1982), who further stated that it will grow on poor soils where few other plants survive. Rose clover does best in reseeding stands where broadleaf filaree, <I>Erodium botrys</I></B>, does well (Love, 1985).<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Rose clover does best in reseeding stands where broadleaf filaree, <I>Erodium botrys</I></B> does well (Love, 1985).<P> According to Slayback (pers. comm.), rose clover grows well with 'Blando' brome, 'Zorro' annual fescue.  Finch and Sharp (1983) state that it can be seeded with subclover or black medic, but McLeod (1982) suggests growing it alone because it is a poor competitor with other species.<P> Finch and Sharp (1983) stated that on extremely infertile soil with almost no growth of native plants, rose clover should be used alone.  If there is a fairly good cover of native weedy annual grasses and other types, use a mixture of 50% rose clover, 25% subclover, and 25% crimson clover.  Bur clover is not recommended in this original mixture because if it is not already present on a range, it is probably not adapted to the local soil.<P> Spacial and temporal variation in soil and weather suggest that mixtures of subterranean and rose clovers be used (Love, 1985). Love and Sumner (1955) recommended mixtures of winter annual legumes is desirable because: (1) Seasons vary in California, and rose clover may do better one year, and subclover another, on the same site.  (2) Soil variation will lead to rose clover occupying the poorer soil or better drained areas, while subclover will do well on the better soil or moister areas.<P> Williams (1963) reported that crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I></B> L., strain S.  Australian commercial), rose clover (<I>T.  hirtum</I></B> All., strain S.6), and subterranean clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I></B> L.  cv 'Bacchus') were sown in pure plantings and in 1:1 mixtures of two species.  Competition for light was assessed in relation to leaf area and leaf position in the canopy. Leaf area in 4-cm horizontal strata, leaf weight, shoot weight production, and light penetration through canopies were measured at intervals during the vegetative phase (i.e., through 99 days after sowing). Crimson and rose clovers held apparent initial advantages over subterranean clover, in terms of light-absorbing surface area of cotyledons and first unifoliate leaves, and because these leaves were elevated further from the soil surface.  However, this situation changed with time.  In paired sowings, crimson and subterranean clover became equally dominant over rose clover, while subterranean clover overtopped crimson despite the greater total leaf area of the latter.  The most productive mixture (crimson clover + subterranean clover) was no more productive that the best species (crimson clover) in monoculture.  Competition has other dimensions than those reported here, including the advantage conferred by hardseededness of rose clover, which enables it to dominate multispecific stands following droughts that kill seedlings of the other two clovers.<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>Rose clover seedlings show good vigor (Slayback, pers. comm.).<P> During establishment, the force produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the weight of overlying soil and surface crusts.  Williams (1956) used glass tubes containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass to estimate the force produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean clover, and alfalfa.  Mean forces exerted (in g, + SEM) were estimated as follows.  Alfalfa: 15.2 + 0.5 g; crimson clover: 23.8 + 0.2; rose clover 24.1 + 0.5; subterranean clover 60.0 + 2.9.  The force exerted by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight, but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting that other factors may operate, as well.<P>

<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Biomass harvest on May 15-16, 1991 at Blue Heron Vineyard, Fetzer Vineyards, Hopland, Mendocino County, California, showed dry above-ground biomass data for cv 'Hykon' rose clover was 6.153+/-1.672 Mg/ha (mean +/-S.E.M.), and with weeds included, 8.130+/-2.198 Mg/ha (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>Rose Clover (Duke, 1981; McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>The seed of rose clover remains viable for a relatively long time (McLeod, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Nitrogen content estimates include 50-100 lb/acre (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and in unirrigated pasture, rose clover was estimated to add about 50-60 lb/a of nitrogen (Holland et al., 1969).  Williams et al. (1974) (cited in Love, 1985) estimated N-fixation of vigorous stands to reach 98 kg N/ha.  Yields in a vineyard trial in Hopland, assuming 12.6% protein (Williams et al., 1957) and 6.25% of that protein being N, suggest an above-ground N content of 48.45 +/- 13.17 kg N/ha (mean +/- SEM) (R.L. Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Rose clover requires the "WR" rhizobial inoculation type (Nitragin Company) (Burton and Martinez, 1980; Duke, 198l; Munoz & Graves, 1988).<P> According to Love (1985), two strains of rhizobia, "R" and K10, are effective on rose clover.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Red clover may be used for erosion control (Munoz & Graves, 1988), and Love and Sumner (1955) considered it the best winter annual-legume for reclaiming abandoned grain land.<P> According to Love and Sumner (1955), rose clover gradually improves soil, permitting growth of desirable forage plants.  They cited the example of a ranch in Santa Clara County where the soil had become very thin, and would not support vegetation.  The soil was improved through the use of rose clover, which built up the depleted nitrogen supply.<P>

<P>
This report from the Washington-based Environmental Working Group
(EWG) found widespread, generally low pesticide levels in food.
Based on data from nearly 20,000 food samples tested between 1990
and 1992 by the Food and Drug Administration and private labs,
the EWG reported that more than half of the food samples had detectable
pesticide residues of at least one pesticide. Of the samples that
had detectable residues, there were few violations of current
tolerance limits.  <BR>

<P>
The EWG report noted that the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) assesses the health risks from pesticides as though people
are exposed to them one at a time. Richard Wiles, the author of
the report, noted that using an additive approach to risk assessment,
just eight pesticides in 20 fruits and vegetables resulted in
the average child exceeding the EPA lifetime one-in-a-million
risk standard from pesticides in food by his or her first birthday.
Risks of this magnitude are unacceptable according to Wiles. To
address these issues, the EWG recommended phasing out pesticides
that pose the greatest risks to children, applying strict health
standards for all pesticides and developing alternative farming
practices. <BR>

<P>
<I>Pesticides in Children's Food </I>was released just prior to
the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report <I>Pesticides in
the Diets of Infants and Children. </I>The Clinton administration
appears to agree with both the NAS and the EWG recommendations.
On June 25, the EPA, United States Department of Agriculture and
the Food and Drug Administration issued a joint statement saying
that they expected to use the reports of the NAS and the EWG on
children and pesticides &quot;as a basis for formulating the legislative
and regulatory policies needed to put the Administrative principles
into effect.&quot; Although both reports show valid concerns with
pesticides in children's food, their recommendations are quite
distinct. Whereas the NAS report focuses on improving risk management
techniques for pesticides in the food supply, the EWG prescribes
reducing pesticide applications and eliminating known cancer-causing
pesticides whenever practical alternatives exist. The EWG report
also supports the development of alternative farming systems.
It is still unclear how the administration will reconcile these
differences and which kinds of policies will be supported.  <BR>

<H1>Owl Box Survey- We Need Your Help!</H1> <BR>

<P>
Have you or someone you know constructed a perch or nesting box
for raptors (hawks and owls) to help control rodents? If so, we
would like you to complete a survey on the role perches and nesting
boxes play in controlling these pests. We are interested in learning
about both successes and failures in attracting raptors or controlling
rodents. <BR>
<BR>
Farmers and gardeners from around the country have built perches
and nesting boxes to attract  raptors, in part because of the
success of a Merced County almond grower who achieved phenomenal
gopher control after he constructed several owl boxes. His story
and research  highlights were featured in the Fall 1992 issue
of <I> Sustainable Agriculture</I> and in several magazines. To
participate in the survey, or to obtain a copy of the SAREP article
which includes perch and box diagrams, write or call Chuck Ingels,

<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>Bugg et al.  (1987) reported that common knotweed, <I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B> L.  (Polygonaceae), a summer annual weed occurring in agricultural and urban settings in much of California, is attended by numerous predatory and parasitic insects, many of which fed on the exposed floral nectar. Representatives of 36 insect taxa were observed feeding at the flowers; 29 of these groups contain entomophagous species.  Other entomophagous insects were associated with a honeydew-producing, host-specific aphid, <I>Aphis avicularis</I></B> Hille Ris Lambers.  Among predators frequently observed feeding at the flowers were bigeyed bugs, <I>Geocoris</I></B> spp.<P> Surveys by Bugg et al.  (1987) indicated that common knotweed plants harbored higher densities of bigeyed bugs than did hay alfalfa (<I>Medicago sativa</I></B> L.), prostrate pigweed (<I>Amaranthus graecizans</I></B> L.), or field bindweed (<I>Convolvulus arvensis</I></B> L.).  Two predators which are also nectarivorous, <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say) and adults of a species of softwinged flower beetle, <I>Collops vittatus</I></B> (Say), survived longer when caged on common knotweed as opposed to hay alfalfa, as did <I>G.  punctipes</I></B> caged on common knotweed as opposed to prostrate pigweed.  No difference in longevity was found when <I>G. punctipes</I></B> was caged on common knotweed with flowers versus without flowers.<P> As reviewed by Bugg and Waddington (1992), various parasitic wasps that attack orchard pests use nectar as a complementary food.  In Ontario, Canada, Leius (1967) stated that mean parasitism of codling moth (<I>Cydia pomonella</I></B> [L.], Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larvae and tent caterpillar (<I>Malacosoma americanum</I></B> [Fabricius], Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) pupae and eggs was higher in apple orchards with rich assemblages of flowering understory plants.  Leius rated 15 orchards as possessing poorly, intermediately, or richly flowering understories.  The rich orchards included the following spring flowers: strawberry (<I>Fragaria</I></B> sp., Rosaceae), buttercup (<I>Ranunculus</I></B> sp., Ranunculaceae), hawkweed (<I>Hieracium</I></B> sp., Asteraceae), clover (<I>Trifolium</I></B> sp., Fabaceae), dandelion (<I>Taraxicum</I></B> sp., Asteraceae), violet (<I>Viola</I></B> sp.), fleabane (<I>Erigeron</I></B> sp., Asteraceae), white mustard (<I>Sinapis arvensis</I></B> L., Brassicaceae), willow (<I>Salix</I></B> sp., Salicaceae), wild cherries and plums (<I>Prunus spp.</I></B>, Rosaceae).  Summer flowers included wild carrot (<I>Daucus carota</I></B> L., Apiaceae), wild parsnip (<I>Pastinaca sativa</I></B> L., Apiaceae), blue-eyed grasses (<I>Sisyrinchium</I></B> spp., Iridaceae), white daisy (<I>Chrysanthemum</I></B> sp., Asteraceae), milkweed (<I>Asclepias syriaca</I></B> L., Asclepiadaceae), sweetclover (<I>Melilotus</I></B> sp., Fabaceae), and alfalfa (<I>Medicago sativa</I></B> L., Fabaceae).  Late summer and autumn flowers were goldenrod (<I>Solidago</I></B> sp., Asteraceae) and aster (<I>Aster</I></B> sp., Asteraceae). Hymenopterous parasites included: (1) for tent caterpillar larvae: the Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera) <I>Itoplectis conquisitor</I></B> (Say), <I>Glypta simplicipes</I></B> Cresson, and <I>Scambus hispae</I></B> (Harris); (2) for tent caterpillar eggs: <I>Telenomus</I></B> sp. (Scelionidae), <I>Ooencyrtus clisiocampe</I></B> (Ashmead) (Encyrtidae), and <I>Eupelmus spongipartus</I></B> Foerster (Eupelmidae).  Parasites of gypsy moth larvae were not identified.  Leius (1967) presented only means, minima, and maxima for each host type under each flowering regime: No inferential statistics were calculated.<P> Bugg and Waddington (1992) re-analyzed Leius's (1967) data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) employing maxima, minima and a composite value representing the mean of the remaining three plots in each treatment.  Significant differences were found using untransformed % parasitism of codling moth larvae (P=0.0282) and tent caterpillar larvae (P=0.0119); there was no significant effect on parasitism of tent caterpillar eggs (P=0.2891).  Fisher's protected least significant difference indicated that parasitism of tent caterpillar larvae was significantly greater in orchards with richly flowering understories than in those of poor or intermediate status. Parasitism of codling moth larvae was significantly greater in richly-flowering understories than in those of poor status. Simple regression analyses of the same data showed that increasing richness of flowering had a significant influence on parasitism of codling moth larvae (P=0.0057) and tent caterpillar larvae (P=0.0037), and a non-significant effect on parasitism of tent caterpillar eggs (P=0.1135).  In all cases, slopes of the fitted lines were positive. These ANOVA and regression analyses effectively decrease the replication by two, because the data from three plots are effectively pooled and regarded as being from a single plot.  From this standpoint, the reassessments are conservative.<P> Batra (1979) found that two introduced Eurasian chickweeds (Caryophyllaceae), chickweed (<I>Stellaria media</I></B> [L.] Vill.), and stitchwort (<I>S.  graminea</I></B> L.) collectively had at least 156 species of associated plant-feeding and pollinating insects. <I>Stellaia media</I></B> is a winter annual commonly found in Californian orchards and is said by Munz (1973) to flower from February to September, although observations by Bugg and Waddington (1992) suggest February through May.  Nectar-feeding entomophagous insects listed by Batra (1979) included numerous species of aphidophagous hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), three species of Tachinidae (Diptera), and , among Hymenoptera, one braconid, 2 Ichneumonidae, and one vespid.  There were also 6 species of ants observed feeding on the floral nectar.  Aphids commonly encountered included green peach aphid on <I>S. media</I></B>.<P> Chickweed can be an important nectar source to parasitic Hymenoptera, as has been documented for a wasp that attacks pests of field crops.  <I>Meteorus rubens</I></B> (Nees von Esenbeck) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which attacks black cutworm (<I>Agrotis ipsilon</I></B> Hufnagel, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), survived and produced more offspring when caged and fed honey-water or given access to chickweed (<I>S.  media</I></B>), wild parsnip (<I>Pastinaca sativa</I></B> L., Apiaceae), wild mustard (<I>Brassica kaber</I></B> [DC.], Brassicaeceae), shepherdspurse (<I>Capsella bursa-pastoris</I></B> [L.] Medic., Brassicaceae), or lady's thumb smartweed (<I>Polygonum persicaria</I></B> L., Polygonaceae) than when caged with water alone (Foster and Ruesink , 1984).  Foster and Ruesink (1986) also found in a greenhouse cage study that chickweed led to an increase in density of the parasite due to better survival.  Number of black cutworm larvae attacked per 24 hours by each individual wasp was not affected by chickweed, but net increase in parasitism was estimated to be 5% due to improved longevity.  This improvement would not offset prefential egg-laying by the pest in cornfields with reduced-tillage management.<P> Toothpick ammi (<I>Ammi visnaga</I></B> [L.] Lamarck, Apiaceae) is an occasional warm-season annual weed in the Central Valley of California and is attractive to a broad spectrum of entomophagous insects (Bugg and Wilson, 1989).  It is seldom found in orchards but could be encouraged in sunlit sections by seeding into prepared seedbeds during the autumn and avoiding tillage and close mowing until after seed maturation in August.<P> Wild carrot (<I>Daucus carota</I></B> L.) is a biennial weed that flowers from May through September (Munz, 1973).  It is common in the northern coastal counties of California and widely recognized as a potent nectar source used by beneficial parasitic and predatory insects (Bohart and Nye, 1960; Judd, 1970; Hirose, 1966). This species can volunteer within a perennial grass matrix, if mowing regimes permit maturation of seed.<P> In California, sweet fennel (<I>Foeniculum vulgare</I></B> Mill., Apiaceae) is a common perennial weed that flowers from May through September (Munz, 1973).<P> In Massachusetts, the domestic form attracted 48 species of parasitic ichneumonid wasps (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) (Maingay et al., 1991) including three that attack larvae of codling moth: <I>Coccygomimus aequalis</I></B> (Provancher), <I>Coccygomimus annulipes</I></B> (Brulle), and <I>Scambus (Atleophadnus) pterophori</I></B> (Ashmead), and several attacking other lepidopterous pests of apple.  Also observed were 4 species of Sphecidae (solitary wasps) and 4 of Vespidae (social wasps). Such predatory wasps are commonly seen in Californian orchards, but their agroecological roles have not been documented.  Sweet fennel is probably too tall to justify inclusion in orchard understory vegetation, but it could easily be tolerated or encouraged along margins.<P> Poison hemlock (<I>Conium maculatum</I></B> L.) is another common, tall-statured weed.  It is abundant throughout the central and north coasts and its flowers are attractive to many beneficial insects.  Poisonous plants such as this are unlikely to warrant encouragement in or near orchards, however (Bugg, pers. obs.).<P> Bugg and Waddington (1993) listed several annual asteraceous weeds as sustaining aphids or other Homoptera that in turn sustain beneficial arthropods.  Annual sowthistle (<I>Sonchus oleraceus</I></B> L.) sustains several species of aphids during April and May; some of these are suitable prey for lady beetles, whereas others are toxic.  Other asteraceous weeds harboring potentially-valuable alternate prey include mayweed (<I>Anthemis cotula</I></B> L.) (flowering April through August) and pineapple weed (<I>Matricaria matricarioides</I></B> [Less.] Porter) (flowering May through August). These weeds can all be abundant in Californian orchards and vineyards.<P> Bugg and Waddington (1992) wrote that several fabaceous plants volunteer in Californian orchards.  Most commonly encountered is bur medic (<I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B> L.), a winter annual; this plant harbors abundant pea aphid and associated lady beetles, but it also sustains high densities of Lygus spp., as noted in southern Georgia by Bugg et al.  (1990b).  Therefore, this plant should probably be used with caution when cover cropping in orchard crops susceptible to lygus damage, e.g., pistachio (Rice, 1985; Michailides, 1989).<P> Various <I>Vicia</I></B> spp.  are also sometimes encountered in resident orchard vegetation, particularly in foothill and northern coastal counties (Bugg et al., 1990).  Common vetch (<I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.) and hybrids thereof have stipular extrafloral nectaries that attract parasitic wasps (Bugg et al., 1990) but also may sustain <I>Lygus spp.  (Bugg et al., 1990a, b). Various vetches also harbor diverse aphids and associated aphidophaga, as detailed in the section on pecan (Bugg and Ellis, 1990; Bugg et al., 1990a, 1991).<P> Various grasses produce windblown pollen used as an alternate food by the predatory mite <I>Euseius tularensis</I></B> Congdon (Acari: Phytoseiidae) (Kennett et al., 1979).  This predator and congeners attack several pests of California citrus and avocado, including avocado brown mite (<I>Oligonychus punicae</I></B> [Hirst], Acari: Tetranychidae), citrus thrips (<I>Scirtothrips citri</I></B> Moulton, Thysanoptera: Thripidae), citrus red mite (<I>Panonychus citri</I></B> [McGregor], Acari: Tetranychidae), and scale crawlers (Homoptera: Diaspididae) (Congdon and McMurtry, 1985).  This mite can subsist and even reproduce on diets of various pollens (Zhimo and McMurtry, 1990).  Deposition of windblown pollen during late winter and early spring has been shown to be particularly important in hastening the seasonal buildup of populations of these mites (Kennett et al., 1979).<P> In California, pollens from anemophilous tree species (e.g., valley oak, <I>Quercus lobata</I></B> Ne_, Fagaceae) are available as early as March (Munz, 1973), whereas annual and perennial grasses produce pollen mainly during April and May.  Cool-season annual grasses that commonly volunteer in Californian orchards include annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I></B> Lamarck), ripgut brome (<I>Bromus rigidus</I></B> Roth.), wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B> L.), wild barley (<I>Hordeum leporinum</I></B> L.), slender wild oat (<I>Avena barbata</I></B> Brot.), rattail fescue (<I>Vulpia myuros</I></B> [L.] M.K. Gmel.).  Flowering periods for these and other grasses are summarized in Table 3, based on records presented by Munz (1973).<P> Bugg (1992) wrote that weeds and wild plants within or outside orchards or vineyards can be important reservoirs for pest or beneficial arthropods (see reviews by Altieri and Letourneau, 1982 and Andow, 1988).  <I>Lygus</I></B> spp. are well known to emanate from weed hosts (Fye, 1980), and under some conditions may damage orchard crops.  Bugg (1992) mentioned that other Miridae and flower thrips (<I>Frankliniella</I></B> spp.) can also cause problems in this regard.  Entomophagous arthropods can also benefit from weeds and other wild plants that provide alternate prey, alternate hosts, honeydew, pollen, or nectar.<P> As recounted by Doutt and Nakata (1965, 1973), <I>Anagrus epos</I></B> is an egg- parasitic wasp that is an important natural enemy of grape leafhopper (<I>Erythroneura elegantula</I></B>) and variegated leafhopper (<I>Erythroneura variabilis</I></B>), both vineyard pests. Wild blackberry (<I>Rubus</I></B> spp.) sustains the alternate-host leafhopper <I>Dikrella californica</I></B> and wild grape (<I>Vitis californica</I></B>) harbors <I>D.  cockerellii</I></B>, both of which overwinter in the egg stage.  These wild plants thereby provide overwintering refugia to the parasite.  The parasite disperses to grapes during spring, and vineyards located near such refugia are believed to have better biological control of pest leafhoppers.<P> The ichneumonid wasp <I>Exochus nigripallipus subobscurus</I></B> is a larval-pupal parasite of orange tortrix (<I>Agrotaenia citrana</I></B>), itself a lepidopterous pest of grapes in the Central Coast region of California. Orange tortrix and another tortricid, <I>Aristoteliae argentifera</I></B>, can also infest coyote brush (<I>Baccharis pilularis</I></B>).  Kido et al.  (1981) suggest that high levels of parasitism of orange tortrix may occur in vineyards with abundant coyote brush nearby.  Orange tortrix can infest various vineyard weeds, including mallow (<I>Malva parviflora</I></B>), curly dock (<I>Rumex crispus</I></B>), filaree (<I>Erodium</I></B> spp.), lupin (<I>Lupinus</I></B> sp.), mustard (<I>Brassica</I></B> sp.), pigweed (<I>Amaranthus</I></B> sp.), and California poppy (<I>Eschscholtsia californica</I></B>) (Kido et al., 1981).  It is not clear what role these weeds or various cover crops could play in sustaining parasites.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Weeds and resident vegetation are identical (editor's note).<P> Above-ground biomass data (dry) were taken in a replicated study (r=4) at Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California. Cover crops were seeded in late October, 1990; harvest was on May 15-16, 1991.  Dominant winter annual weeds were chickweed, shepherds purse, rattail fescue, and annual ryegrass. Data were as follows: CONTROL: 4.917+/-1.010 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M. (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> Vegetational cover data were measured for cover crops in a replicated trial (r=4) at the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991: CONTROL: 100.00+/-0.00 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (dominated by chickweed, shepherds purse, annual ryegrass) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>At the Blue Heron Vineyard (Fetzer Vineyards), Hopland, Mendocino County, California, May, 1991, total above-ground biomass data (dry, cover crop + weeds) in weedy control plots was 4.917+/-1.010 Mg/ha, (Mean +/- S.E.M., r=4). The weed flora was dominated by chickweed, shepherds purse, and annual ryegrass (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> Cheeseweed (<I>Malva parviflora</I></B>) and various mustards (<I>Brassica</I></B> spp.) produce abundant biomass.  McKee (1910) measured above-ground biomass production by cheeseweed (<I>Malva rotundifolia</I></B>) at 22.2 Mg/ha (fresh weight), whereas Bugg et al. (unpublished manuscript) estimated that black mustard (<I>Brassica nigra</I></B>) contained 10.9 Mg/ha in dry matter.<P> Residues of such grasses as wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B>), ripgut brome (<I>Bromus rigidus</I></B>), and wild barley (<I>Hordeum leporinum</I></B>) are rich in lignin, which when decomposed by soil microorganisms is believed by some researchers to degrade to fulvic and humic acids, essential to the maintenance of soil fertility (Waksman , 1936; Flaig, 1964).<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>Forcella and Gill (1986) showed that timing of tillage can be used to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn. Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Forcella and Gill (1986) showed that timing of tillage can determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).

Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.  Fall or winter tillage predisposes for common knotweed, which does not germinate during the spring or summer.<P> Understory weeds managed as cover crops become assets to which the euphemism "resident vegetation" is usually applied.  The timing of mowing or tillage can influence the floristic composition of understory weed complexes (Altieri and Whitcomb, 1978/1979), as can soil conditions (Hill and Ramsay, 1977), or herbicide applications (Meagher and Meyer, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>Weeds can be managed as de facto cover crops, and thereby become assets in the understories of orchards and vineyards. When so managed, the euphemism "resident vegetation" is usually applied (Bugg, 1992).  The timing of mowing or tillage can influence the prevalent weed complex (Altieri and Whitcomb, 1978/1979).<P> Forcella and Gill (1986) showed that timing of tillage can be used to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn. Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Forcella and Gill (1986) showed that timing of tillage can be used to determine floristic composition of swards.  Seeds of subterranean clover and annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium rigidum</I></B>) are less persistent than sorrel (<I>Rumex acetosella</I></B>) and common knotweed (<I>Polygonum aviculare</I></B>).  Red brome (<I>Bromus rubens</I></B>), silvergrass (<I>Vulpia</I></B> spp.), and subterranean clover dominated only where tillage was in summer or early autumn. Annual ryegrass was most abundant where soil was tilled in late autumn and early winter.  Sorrel and common knotweed were favored only by winter tillage.<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Some weeds are regarded as "dynamic accumulators" of nutrients (Kourik, 1986) and can help correct soil nutrient deficiencies.<P> In California, such volunteer nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae as woolypod vetch (<I>Vicia villosa</I></B> ssp.  <I>dasycarpa</I></B>) can contain 250 kg N/ha or more, whereas burclover (<I>Medicago polymorpha</I></B>) can contain 140 kg N/ha or more (summarized in Bugg et al., 1992). Like many weeds, both of these species have fairly indeterminate growth habits (given adequate water), with seed production by late March for burclover and mid May for woolypod vetch; both can be managed to reseed as well as produce N for the associated cash crops.<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>Some weeds are regarded as "dynamic accumulators" of nutrients (Kourik, 1986) and can help correct soil nutrient deficiencies.<P> Weeds may also concentrate soil nutrients out of proportion to their apparent abundance; with proper management, this could conceivably lead to improved availability to cash crops, although the subject requires more study.  As summarized by Kourik (1986), Chickweed (<I>Stellaria media</I></B>) is believed to accumulate P, K, and Mn; mustards (<I>Brassica</I></B> spp.) are rich in S, P, and Fe. Scarlet pimpernel (<I>Anagallis arvensis</I></B>) is thought to accumulate Ca, and sowthistle (<I>Sonchus arvensis</I></B>) Mg, K, and Cu.<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>As recounted by Bugg (1992) weeds play a paradoxical role in orchards and vineyards.  Some species compete excessively for water and nutrients, and some can harbor ice-nucleating bacteria, thereby predisposing for frost damage.  On the other hand, weeds have also been termed "the guardians of the soil (Cocannauer, 1950)," which is hardly an exaggeration in light of their tendency to quickly colonize and cover disturbed areas, reducing soil erosion.<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Both cheeseweed and mustard have strong taproots that might be expected to help break up zones of soil compaction.  Winter annual weedy grasses, such as the wild oat (<I>Avena fatua</I></B>), ripgut brome (<I>Bromus rigidus</I></B>), and wild barley (<I>Hordeum leporinum</I></B>) have relatively superficial fibrous root systems that promote good soil structure, reduce crusting and increase water infiltration.  Roots of various grasses are efficient at scavenging soil N, preventing its leaching as nitrate through the soil profile (Bugg and Miller, 1991a, b; Miller et al., 1989).  Brassicaceaeous weeds and common fiddleneck (<I>Amsinckia intermedia</I></B> F & M, Boraginaceae) are also regarded as efficient nitrogen scavengers; residues of these decompose and release N faster than do grass residues (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>

<B><DT>Common Name</B>
<DD>This species is called common vetch, spring vetch, or Oregon vetch (Goar, 1934; Madson, 1951; see: Hermann, 1960; Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Scientific Name</B>
<DD><I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.  (Hermann, 1960; Duke, 1971).  Some researchers consider this species to also comprise as a subspecies <I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> Reichard, also known as <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.  ssp. <I>nigra</I></B> (L.) Ehrh., narrowleaf or blackpod vetch.<P>
<B><DT>Growth Habit</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) described the species as a straggling or ascending robust annual herb.  There is moderate density of growth; growth habit is similar to that of purple vetch (Madson, 1951).<P>
<B><DT>Soil Type</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) stated that common vetch is adapted to a wide range of soil conditions, doing best on the fine-textured clay and clay-loam soils, but also performing well on sandy loam and even on somewhat gravelly soils.  According to Duke (1981), common vetch does best on loams, sandy loams or gravelly soil.  Madson (1951) specified loam soils as optimal.  Good drainage is essential (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Mature Plant Description</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) termed the plant an annual herb.  Hermann (1960) described this species as a glabrescent annual; stems are slender, angled, simple or branched below, up to a meter long, erect-ascending or climbing; leaves with 8 to 16 leaflets terminating in a branched tendril; leaflets oblong to elliptic or obovate, 1.5 to 3.5 cm long, 5 to 15 mm wide, truncate to emarginate and mucronate at the apex; stipules semisagittate, usually sharply serrate, the lower surface bearing a purplish nectary; flowers mostly paired in the upper axils, subsessile, 1.8 to 3 cm long, violet-purple or rarely white; calyx 10 to 15 mm long, the tube campanulate, 5 to 7 mm long, the teeth subequal, linear-subulate, 3 to 9 mm long, the three lower ones bearing a conspicuous yellowish-brown nectary on the outer face; pod nearly cylindrical to somewhat compressed, torulose, 2.5 to 7 cm long, 5 to 8 mm wide, brown, 4- to 12- seeded.<P> According to Madson (1951), the herbage is usually smooth or with little pubescence.  The flowers are quite large, blue or bluish purple or bicolored and are borne without a stem in the axis of the leaf.  Only a few flowers are present in each raceme.  Leaves are compound, made up of several pairs of leaflets, but without a terminal leaflet.<P> Goar (1934) mentioned that the leaflets have a pinched-off appearance, with the midrib extended.  Usually there are seven pairs of leaflets with a terminal tendril.  The violet-purple flowers are borne in pairs on very short stalks.  The stems and leaves are relatively smooth (not hairy).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Dates</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) stated that seeding should be done in the fall; in the interior valleys the proper time is October or November.  If the crop is to be used for both pasture and hay, the date should be not later than October 20.  In the coastal region and in the foothill sections, planting may be safely delayed.  In Marin and Alameda counties, plantings made in December and January 1 have succeeded.  In unirrigated areas seeding may be delayed until rains occur.  If weeds are not abundant, the seeding may be done in the "dust", as was done at Ahwahnee.<P> Madson (1951) wrote that seeding may be from October through November.  Except in coastal areas, common vetch should be seeded on pre-irrigated land not later than November 1st.<P>
<B><DT>Temperature</B>
<DD>Common vetch is suitable in areas with mild winters and often winter kills in the northern part of the cotton belt; it does well in western Oregon and Washington (Duke, 1981).  Madson (1951) listed the species as moderately resistant to cold and adapted to about the same conditions as purple vetch; it is slightly more cold resistant, but it does not grow as rapidly during the winter.  Duke (1981) listed the species as tolerating mean annual temperatures of from 5.6-22.5 degrees C, (mean of 74 cases=12.2), and cv 'Willamette' and ssp.  <I>amphicarpa</I></B> are mentioned as having special cold tolerance.<P> Goar (1934) stated that common vetch will withstand temperatures as low as 10 F above zero with little or no injury.  Since it quickly succumbs in hot weather, it should be planted in the fall and harvested in the spring.  Its rate of growth during the winter months is intermediate.  In cold weather, it makes more growth than hairy vetch, but less than purple (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Rate</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) recommended 74 lbs/acre to obtain 12 vetch seeds per square foot, or 522,720 seeds per acre.  Madson (1951) and Miller et al. (1989) suggested 60 to 75 lbs/acre.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Method</B>
<DD>On pre-irrigated land, seed should by drilled deep enough to contact moist soil.  It can be planted 2 in or more in depth.  Late plantings should be shallower (Madson, 1951).<P> Drilling is the best method because it distributes the seeds more evenly and places them at a more uniform depth in the soil; the result is better germination and stand.  If no grain drill is available, the seed may be broadcast (Goar, 1934).<P> The seedbed for vetches should be firm but well prepared.  In dry-land sections, summer-fallowed land should be worked lightly after the first rains in the fall to destroy the first flush of weed seedlings and prepare the seedbed.  In areas where rains are late, common vetch may require pre-irrigation about October 1, followed by disking or spring-tooth harrowing and rolling, floating, or otherwise smoothing the surface in time to plant the vetch by October 15 (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Description</B>
<DD>Seeds are globose or somewhat compressed, 3 to 5 mm in diameter, smooth, dull or velvety, greenish gray to maroon or black, rarely yellowish white; hilum narrow, encircling 1/6 to 1/5 of the seed (Hermann, 1960).  According to Goar (1934), there are several subspecies of common vetch all varying considerably as to size and color of seed; the most important of these subspecies and the one most commonly used in California has relatively large gray seeds mottled with a darker color.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Diseases</B>
<DD>The incidence of cotton root rot has been increased when following common vetch with no-till cotton (Hargrove, 1982).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Insects</B>
<DD>In California, common vetch is often grown in mixtures with oat, hairy vetch, and field pea for cover cropping in both annual and perennial farming systems.  The oat supplies windblown pollen during April and May, and bird cherry - oat aphid (<I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B> during March and April; these are used as food by some beneficial arthropods.  Common vetch harbors pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> and cowpea aphid (<I>Aphis craccivora</I></B>) and has extrafloral nectaries (on the stipules) that attract various beneficial predatory and parasitic insects, as well as certain pests such as <I>Lygus hesperus</I></B> (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> In southern Georgia, blackpod or narrowleaf vetch (<I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> or <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> ssp.  <I>nigra</I></B>) volunteers in the understories of pecan orchards and can harbor substantial densities of pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B>) and cowpea aphid (<I>Aphis craccivora</I></B>) and associated lady beetles.  It may prove useful in efforts to enhance biological control in pecans (Bugg et al., 1989 and 1991b).<P> Bugg et al.  (1991b) grew cool-season cover crops relay intercropped with spring-planted cantaloupe (<I>Cucumis melo</I></B> L. var.  <I>reticulatus</I></B> Seringe).  Of eight cover-crop regimes tested, a subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I></B> L. cv 'Mt.  Barker') and a hybrid vetch (<I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.  X <I>V. cordata</I></B> Wulf cv 'Vantage') harbored especially-high densities of the generalist predator <I>Geocoris punctipes</I></B> (Say) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) amid cover crops, their residues, or weeds; on or near cantaloupe plants; and on or near sentinel egg masses of fall armyworm, <I>Spodoptera furgiperda</I></B> (J.  E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) pinned to cantaloupe leaves. Absolute responses were highest for the plots of subterranean clover.  Among those regimes attaining good stands of cover crops, numbers of <I>G. punctipes</I></B> per sentinel egg mass were significantly greater for the subterranean clover regime than for rye, crimson clover, polyculture, but not than 'Vantage' vetch. Rye was particularly poor habitat for <I>G.  punctipes</I></B>.<P> Bugg et al.  (1990a) found that <I>Lygus</I></B> spp., which are important pests of field, row, and orchard crops, were exceptionally abundant on the hybrid vetches 'Cahaba White' and 'Vantage', both of which derive from the cross <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L.  X <I>V.  cordata</I></B> Wulf and thus include common vetch in their parentage.  Both hybrid vetches feature stipular extrafloral nectaries at which <I>Lygus</I></B> frequently fed.  Various Vespidae (Hymenoptera) were also often observed feeding at the stipular extrafloral nectaries of 'Cahaba White' and 'Vantage', as were the following Ichneumonidae: <I>Eutanyacra melanotaris</I></B> Heinrich, <I>Vulgichneumon brevicinctor</I></B> (Say), and <I>Woldstedtius flavolineatus</I></B> (Gravenhorst).<P> Bugg et al.  (1990b) found especially-high densities of tarnished plant bug (<I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> [Palisot de Beauvois]) during April and early May. They attained relatively-high densities on hybrid vetches (cv 'Cahaba White' or 'Vantage'), lower levels on crimson clover and lentil, and particularly-low densities on 'Mt. Barker' subterranean clover.  Low densities were also obtained on 10 other varieties of subterranean clover.  Late-instar and adult tarnished plant bug lived longer when caged on crimson clover than on hybrid vetch, which in turn supported better survival than did subterranean clover. When adult tarnished plant bug were caged on hybrid vetch or subterranean clover with or without floral and fruiting structures, there was no evidence that the presence of these structures prolonged tarnished plant bug survival on either crop.  In choice tests with flowering and fruiting sprigs of three cover crops, tarnished plant bug preferred crimson clover over hybrid vetch, which in turn was more attractive than subterranean clover.  When sprigs were presented after reproductive structures had been excised, there was no statistically-significant preference by tarnished plant bug.<P> Results of the survival and choice experiments do not explain why tarnished plant bug was typically more abundant on hybrid vetches than on crimson clover.  Early-instar tarnished plant bug nymphs may find the extrafloral nectar of the vetches more accessible than the floral nectar of crimson clover.  Such an effect on early-instar nymphs could have led to the observed differences in densities.  Subterranean clovers appear to provide both a less-attractive and less-favorable habitat for <I>Lygus lineolaris</I></B> (Palisot de Beauvois) than either crimson clover or the hybrid vetches.  Preferred use of subterranean clovers in rotation or as interplants might reduce tarnished plant bug in agroecosystems.<P> Meagher and Meyer (1990) reported that in North Carolina, narrowleaf vetch, <I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> (sometimes regarded as a subspecies of common vetch, <I>V.  sativa</I></B> ssp. <I>angustifolia</I></B>), dominates the undertstories of peach orchards in which Simizine is applied.  Where vetch is dominant, infestations of spider mites tend to be exacerbated.  The authors indicate that the lack of other later-maturing hosts may predispose for migration of the spider mites into trees.<P> In southern Oregonian pear orchards, Flexner et al.  (1990) found that certain understory weeds can harbor high densities of twospotted spider mite, <I>Tetranychus urticae</I></B> Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae).  This mite is mainly a secondary pest and a creature of pesticide-disrupted or stressed agroecosystems. Among the plant species suitable for use as cover crops, vetch appeared particularly prone to outbreaks of the mite.  Use of herbicides led to increased movement by mites into trees.<P>
<B><DT>Biomass</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) summarized above-ground dry matter yields of various researchers, including figures of 5.629 ('26866'), 7.943 ('16642'), 6.759 ('Blanchegraine'), and 6.406 ('Vedoc') (cultivars given in parentheses).  Mean dry weight of a three-year field trial in Georgia was 4.30 Mg/ha (Hargrove, 1986). Dry matter yields (Mg/ha) obtained in individual studies were given by Smith et al.  (1987) as: 5.0, 3.7, 4.3.  In Hopland, Mendocino County, California, common vetch produced 8.912+/-0.950 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.; including weeds, biomass was 9.214+/-0.695 (Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M.) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P> Abd El Monem et al.  (1990) reported that in Syria rainfed common vetch (selection 2541) at 102, 118 132, and 145 days after planting (D.A.P.) yielded 1.38, 3.47, 3.93, and 4.74 Mg/ha of dry matter during 1986-87.  During 1987-88 at 115, 130, 144, and 163 D.A.P. the corresponding figures were 2.46, 4.31, 5.67, and 6.54.  The corresponding yields for selection 2037 were 1.22, 2.78, 3.79, 4.33, 2.15, 3.80, 5.86, and 7.69.  For selection 2020, the corresponding yields were 0.90, 2.18, 3.41, 3.61, 1.81, 3.00, 4.86, and 5.30.  To summarize, maximum biomass yields were obtained around 145-163 D.A.P, and those yields were 4.74 and 6.54 Mg/ha for selection 2541; 4.33 and 7.69 Mg/ha for selection 2037; and 3.61 and 5.30 for selection 2020 Mg/ha.  Rainfed woollypod vetch attained maximum biomass yield at 20-50% podding. By contrast, common vetch attained maximum biomass at maturity.<P>
<B><DT>Maximum Height</B>
<DD>Plants of this variety grow to a height of 3 to 5 feet or more, according to Goar (1934), but Bugg (pers. comm.) remarked that the species will only attain such a height if supported by rye or some other tall companion crop.  In monocultural plots in Hopland, Mendocino County, California, height was 54.61+/-3.02 cm (Mean +/- S.E.M.) (21.5 +/- 1.19 inches) (Bugg et al., unpublished data).<P>
<B><DT>Uses</B>
<DD>According to Goar (1934), when properly cured, this variety makes good quality hay.  In a mixture with oat, rye, or barley, it affords pasturage in the late winter and early spring.  If sufficient moisture is available and the stock is removed in March, hay can be harvested in May.  Vetch should not be grazed too closely if subsequent hay is desired.  Calves and sheep apparently do the least damage in grazing vetch.<P> Common vetch makes excellent pasture or silage.  (Duke, 1981)<P>
<B><DT>Mixtures</B>
<DD>Goar (1934) remarked that when used for forage or cover cropping, vetches and peas are usually interseeded with cereals, which will support the legume. Oat is most commonly used, although rye, wheat, or barley are occasionally preferred by growers.  Vetch or Austrian winter peas are good in mixtures with oat in California because they mature at the same time.<P> In California, common vetch is often grown in mixtures with oat, hairy vetch, and field pea for cover cropping in both annual and perennial farming systems. The oat supplies windblown pollen during April and May, and bird cherry - oat aphid (<I>Rhopalosiphum padi</I></B> during March and April; these are used as food by some beneficial arthropods.  Common vetch harbors pea aphid (<I>Acyrthosiphon pisum</I></B> and cowpea aphid (<I>Aphis craccivora</I></B>) and has extrafloral nectaries (on the stipules) that attract various beneficial predatory and parasitic insects, as well as certain pests, like <I>Lygus hesperus</I></B> (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P> Various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine which is released into soil as a root exudate, and apparently is an allelopathic compound. This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.  (Schenk and Werner, 1991).<P> In Cyprus, monocultures of oat (<I>Avena sativa</I></B>, cv 'Mulga') or triticale yielded more dry matter and digestible organic matter than did bicultures involving these cereals in combination with common vetch (<I>Vicia sativa</I></B>) or pea (<I>Pisum sativum</I></B>). Yields of mixtures did exceed those of monocultures of the relevant legumes.  Digestibility and crude protein content were highest in mixtures of peas and triticale.  There appears little incentive for farmers to grow mixtures of annual legumes and small-grained cereals for forage production (Droushiotis, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Harvesting</B>
<DD>Common vetch is best for hay when cut in full bloom.  Vetch leaves dry much faster than the stems, so it must be handled rapidly in the field or leaves will be lost to shattering (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Water</B>
<DD>Tolerates from 3.1 to 16.3 dm of precipitation, with the mean of 74 cases being (8.0 Duke 1981).  Based on the account by Goar (1934), in areas where rains are late, common vetch may require pre-irrigation about October 1.  On soils of good moisture-holding capacity in the Central Valley, common vetch often requires no additional irrigation.  After rains cease, an irrigation in April is sometimes necessary.  On lighter soils in the Central Valley, three to five irrigations may be necessary to produce a good yield. In the coastal and foothill areas, rainfall alone usually suffices.<P>
<B><DT>Seeding Depth</B>
<DD>Depth of seeding can range from 1.5 to 2.5 inches according to moisture conditions (Goar, 1934).<P>
<B><DT>Equipment</B>
<DD>Flail and rotary mowers are more reliable than sicklebar mowers especially if vetch is matted or wet (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>N Contribution</B>
<DD>Aboveground nitrogen content was 134 kg/ha in the sole study reviewed by Smith et al.  (1987); estimated N fertilizer equvalence of common vetch under no-tillage regimes was, when followed by sorghum, 30-83 kg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Geographic Range</B>
<DD>The primary center of diversity is the Near East from Boreal Moist to West through Subtropical Thorn to Moist Forest Life Zones. This species is widespread as an escape from cultivation in the temperate parts of the world. Common in roadsides of the U.S. <I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> may be the ancestral species (Duke, 1981). Munz (1973) mentioned that common vetch is naturalized in waste places west of the Sierra Nevada.  Common vetch is suitable in areas with mild winters and often winter kills in the northern part of the cotton belt; it does well in western Oregon and Washington (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Soil pH</B>
<DD>Common vetch tolerates pH of from 4.5-8.2, with the mean for 71 cases being 6.5; excess lime is injurious.  It is said to be tolerant of low pH (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Inoculation</B>
<DD>Common vetch requires "Special Culture 2 for Vetch." (Duke, 1981), whereas <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> ssp.  <I>nigra</I></B> (also known as narrowleaf vetch or blackpod vetch, <I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B>) requires inoculant type "C" (Duke, 1981).  Apparently, type "C" can also work for common vetch (Hanna, R., pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Livestock</B>
<DD>Common vetch makes excellent pasture or silage; seeds contain several toxic principles (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Root System</B>
<DD>Common vetch taproots can extend 3-5 ft deep (Brinton, 1989).<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Nematodes</B>
<DD>Gallaher et al.  (1988), working in Florida, evaluated nematode accumulation on and damage to hairy vetch and four vetch cultivars derived form hybridization with common vetch ('Vantage', 'Cahaba White', 'Vanguard', and 'Nova II') using tillage and no-till regimes preceding corn or sorghum.  The soil type was sandy loam. Densities of <I>Meloidogyne incognita</I></B> were much higher on hairy vetch than on any of the vetches derived from common vetch. <I>Criconemella ornata</I></B> attained relatively-high densities on 'Vantage', 'Cahaba White', and 'Vanguard.' <I>Pratylenchus brachyurus</I></B> and <I>Paratrichodorus minor</I></B> reached statistically-similar densities on all five vetches.  Root gall index was highest for hairy vetch.  Numbers of <I>Pratylenchus brachyurus</I></B> per 10 g of roots were particularly high for 'Cahaba White', and 'Vanguard.' Tillage regime had little effect on nematode densities, but ring nematode did occur at significantly-higher densities under no-till management.<P> Ball and Gray (1980) reported that cvv 'Cahaba White.' 'Nova II,' 'Vanguard,' and 'Vantage,' all hybrid vetches that include common vetch in ther parentages, were resistant to <I>Meloidogyne javanica, M.  incognita</I></B>, and <I>Hederodera glycine</I></B>, but susceptible to <I>Meloidogyne arenaria</I></B> and <I>M.  hapla</I></B>.<P>
<B><DT>Pest Effects, Weeds</B>
<DD>Schenk and Werner (1991) stated that various legumes in the tribe Vicieae (peas, lentils, and vetches) contain Beta-(3-isoxazolinonyl) alanine, which is released into soil as a root exudate and apparently is an allelopathic compound.  This chemical can cause reduced growth in seedlings of various grasses and of lettuce.  Pea was only slightly affected.<P> Bugg et al.  (unpublished data) report that in Hopland, Mendocino County, plots sown to common vetch, produced a weed above-ground dry biomass of 0.303+/-0.279 Mg/ha, Mean +/- S.E.M., which was only 6.2% of the weed biomass in unseeded control plots. Dominant weeds were darnel, scarlet pimpernel, common chickweed, and shepherspurse.  By early May, vegetational cover by common vetch was 100.00+/-0.00 % Vegetational Cover (Mean +/- S.E.M.).<P>
<B><DT>Seed Production</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) stated that world production of seed averaged 0.997 Mg/ha; highest yields were obtained in Yugoslavia: 3.020 Mg/ha. Abd El Monem et al. (1990) reported that in Syria, rainfed common vetch yielded as follows: selection 2541, 2.31 and 2.37 Mg/ha; selection 2037, 0.98 and 1.28; and selection 2020, 1.18 and 0.93 Mg/ha.<P>
<B><DT>Cultivar</B>
<DD>Cultivars include 'Willamette,' 'Pearl,' 'Doark,' 'Warrior,' 'Blanchegraine,' 'Vedoc,' 'Obrazet,' 'Nora II,' 'Vanguard,' 'Cahaba White,' and 'Vantage' are hybrids of <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> X <I>Vicia cordata</I></B> (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Seedling Description</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Nutrients</B>
<DD>Liming may be useful, but in excess is injurious (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Shade Tolerance</B>
<DD>No specific information is available on its shade tolerance, but common vetch has done well as an understory cover crop in Californian prune, walnut, and pear orchards, and in vineyards (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Salinity Tolerance</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Herbicide Sensitivity</B>
<DD>No specific information is available on herbicide tolerance of common vetch, but blackpod or narrowleaf vetch (<I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> Reichard or <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> L. ssp. <I>nigra</I></B> L. Ehrh.), which is regarded by some as a form of common vetch, is tolerant of the pre-emergence herbicide simazine (Meagher and Meyer, 1990).<P>
<B><DT>Life Cycle</B>
<DD>In coastal Oregon , common vetch may be spring sown (Duke, 1981), but in most areas it is fall sown (Bugg, pers. comm.). Duke (1981) listed its flowering period as July through September and its seed as being ripened from August through October.  Munz (1973) listed common vetch as flowering from April through July in California.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Cost</B>
<DD>Seed of common vetch usually costs less than that of 'Lana' woolypod vetch.<P>
<B><DT>Seed Availability</B>
<DD>Common vetch seed is widely available; The Southern Seedsmen's Association (1992) listed 19 suppliers, including 9 from Oregon.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Flowering</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) listed the flowering period of common vetch as July through September and its seed as being ripened from August through October.  Munz (1973) listed <I>Vicia sativa</I></B> as flowering from April through July in California, and <I>Vicia angustifolia</I></B> as flowering from April through June.<P>
<B><DT>Days to Maturity</B>
<DD>Duke (1981) common vetch ripened seed from August through October. In California, ripening probably occurs from May through July (Bugg, pers. comm.)<P>
<B><DT>Seed Storage</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on this subject.<P>
<B><DT>Establishment</B>
<DD>There is no specific information on this subject.<P>
<B><DT>Maintenance</B>
<DD>Common vetch is said to tolerate frost, fungus, grazing, high and low pH , insects, nematodes, virus, and weeds (Duke, 1981). Being insect pollinated, its seed production benefits from nearby bee hives (Duke, 1981).<P>
<B><DT>Mowing</B>
<DD>Inasmuch as common vetch tolerates grazing (Duke, 1981), it presumably can tolerate mowing as well.  It has fared well in prune and pear orchards where high mowing is practiced (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Incorporation</B>
<DD>As a green manure, common vetch is easily incorporated using disk harrow; presumably, full flower is the proper phenological stage for plow-down (Bugg, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Non-N Nutrient Contribution</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Water</B>
<DD>No information is available in this database on this topic.<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Microclimate</B>
<DD>No specific information is available on effects on microclimate by common vetch.  In vineyards, common vetch is less likely to ascend trellises than is 'Lana' woolypod vetch (Rick Miller, R.L. Bugg, pers. comm.); the former may be preferable if this lowers the level of the boundary layer and lessens the threat of frost damage (Rick Miller, pers. comm.).<P>
<B><DT>Effects on Soil</B>
<DD>Common vetch is widely used as a soil-improving cover crop or green manure (Duke, 1981).<P>

<H1>Clover Cover Shows Promise in Orchard<BR>
</H1>
<P>
A workshop demonstrating the conversion of grass and broadleaf
weeds to clovers in a foothill orchard attracted 45 people November
11 to Penryn.  The clover demonstration project in the Pilz' Hillcrest
Orchards began in the spring of 1989 and is a cooperative effort
between Hillcrest Orchards, UC Cooperative Extension and the California
 Energy  Commission (CEC). The CEC provided a grant for the study
in an effort to find ways to reduce dependence on fuel and synthetic
fertilizers.   The workshop was also co-sponsored by Placer Farm
Supply.<BR>
<P>
<B>Garth Veerkamp</B>, Placer/Nevada counties farm advisor, and
grower <B>Steve Pilz</B> planted a cover of white Dutch-O'Connor
strawberry clover mix into the ten-acre hillside citrus orchard.
It is still too early to determine if the clovers will provide
the entire nitrogen needs of the orchard, according to Veerkamp.
He said the literature indicates an annual nitrogen fixation rate
of 30-200 lbs/acre for these clovers, and Pilz predicted it may
be as much as 150<I> </I>lbs/acre in this orchard. Summer soil
samples in fact showed a sharp increase in nitrate-nitrogen, according
to Veerkamp. However, he attributed this increase to the release
of nitrogen from the stubble mowed off before planting, since
perennial clovers require about 18 months before  fixed  nitrogen
will  be released.  Mowing time has been reduced  since  the 
cover  was planted, he said.<BR>
<H3>Planting Procedure</H3>
<P>
Veerkamp and Pilz said the procedure they used in converting the
orchard floor to perennial clovers has included both successes
and setbacks. In order to increase the pH of the soil, acidified
by years of commercial nitrogen fertilizers, 25 tons of beet lime
were added along with 5,000<I> </I>pounds of 0-20-7 fertilizer
to the 10 acre site. The orchard  sod  was  sprayed  with glyphosate
in early April and mowed close to the ground two weeks later,
according to Veerkamp.  Pilz noted that while several methods
of cultivation were attempted on the steep terrain, harrowing
proved to be the most effective. In early May they sowed 150 pounds
of the inoculated clover seed with a &quot;belly grinder&quot;
(hand-seeder) and later ring-rolled the soil and sprinkled it
every two days until it became established.<BR>
<P>
Veerkamp  explained  how  the clovers could be planted from spring
through fall with proper irrigation. The late spring planting
was successful in part because the trees shaded the seedlings
from heat damage, he said. He also advised using caution if seeding
in the fall to allow about a month of growth, or until the clover
has three true leaves, before the danger of frost.
<P>
In any case, &quot;mowing is critical before seeding in order
to maximize the light received by the clover,&quot; Veerkamp noted.
He said there are no selective herbicides registered for bearing
citrus, so the weeds must be mowed to the height of the clover
as it grows.  He said most weed seeds will not germinate through
a thick stand of clover. Pilz estimates they should be able to
reduce orchard mowings by four per year.<BR>
<H3>System Changes</H3>
<P>
Pilz and Veerkamp noted that their cover crop strategy didn't
solve all their problems, and they are learning that an orchard
is a dynamic system. Veerkamp said that introducing this new component,
clover, has resulted in several other changes in the system including
an initial increase in thrips and aphids on the trees after the
sod died. Pilz noted that the use of cover crops is not a new
idea; their goal is to see if this older strategy will fit current
needs. He said their plan is one step in reducing the use of conventional
energy for food production. <BR>

<P>
The use of mulches may be beneficial for citrus and avocado crops,
since they are very shallow-rooted. Some mulches have been shown
to reduce Phytophthora root rots through one or more of several
mechanisms. This multidisciplinary project, conducted at UC Riverside,
examined the use of various organic materials as mulches on young
citrus and avocado trees. The goal of the research was to determine
the effects of these materials on plant growth and health and
their ability to support the growth of microbial biocontrol agents.
The researchers also correlated biological parameters with chemical
composition of the mulches to determine which mulch characteristics
support growth of the trees and of microbial biocontrol agents.
Field experiments are also underway to complement this greenhouse
work.
<H3>Materials and Methods</H3>

<P>
Eighteen mulching materials were used in the experiment, some
of which were composted. Mulches were applied to 'Topa Topa' avocado
and 'Troyer' citrange seedlings recently transplanted to pots
in a greenhouse (500 ml of mulch per 3-liter pot). Five replicate
plants each were used, and the experiments were terminated after
three months. Analyses were made of numerous characteristics of
the mulch materials, growth of three microbial antagonists of
pathogens, and various plant responses.
<H3>Results </H3>

<P>
The greatest amounts of ammonia were released from grass clippings,
milled almond and peanut hulls, and alfalfa hay (Table 1). None
of the mulches significantly increased shoot growth of citrange
seedlings compared to the control. In contrast, avocado shoot
growth significantly increased with mulches of yard waste, grass
clippings, and earthworm-composted sludge. Almond and peanut hulls
were clearly detrimental to the roots of both citrange and avocado
roots and to the shoot growth of avocado. The microbial biocontrol
agents as a group grew best in yard waste, sudangrass hay, wood
compost, rice hulls and rice hulls/paper. Of these, only yard
waste, rice hulls, and rice hulls/paper were completely acceptable
as mulches for avocado and citrus.
<H3>Discussion</H3>

<P>
Citrus and avocado are well suited to benefit from mulches. They
have very shallow root systems, with the far majority of their
roots located in the top 1 to 2 feet of soil. Avocado roots will
often grow up directly into a mulch layer; this fact led the researchers
to believe that avocado responds more positively to mulching than
does citrus.
<P>
Among the mulches examined, the structure and chemical composition
of yard waste most closely resembles a forest litter layer similar
to that in which citrus and avocado evolved. According to the
authors, the beneficial effects of yard wastes can be explained
by the high-nitrogen grass that offset the high carbon-to-nitrogen
composition of wood chips and greatly reduced any temporary nitrogen
shortage.
<P>
The authors believe that citrus responded better with higher nitrogen
and lower carbon mulches than did avocado because citrus responds
to nitrogen deficiencies far more rapidly than does avocado. Some
of the mulches, such as almond and peanut hulls, several manures,
and alfalfa hay, had negative effects in this experiment: They
reduced shoot and/or root growth, released large amounts of ammonia
upon degradation, and resulted in undetectable populations of
at least two of the three biocontrol agents tested.
<P>
Animal manures are among the most common amendments applied to
citrus and avocado orchards. The authors noted that root damage
after application of high ammonia-releasing manures is common,
especially to young trees. (Well-composted animal manures which
do not release ammonia are believed by the authors to be acceptable
for use on citrus.) Young trees are also more sensitive to Phytophthora
infection. The authors believe that young trees are more susceptible
to damage due to the higher foliage-to-root ratio of young compared
to older trees; also, older trees may not show damage from the
use of manures even though some root loss occurs. They also caution
against extrapolating the results of these greenhouse experiments
to effects of mulching in the field.
<P>
The successful growth of the three microbial biocontrol agents
on several mulching materials was promising. Strains of the three
species tested, the common soil bacterium, <I>Pseudomonas fluorescens</I>
and the ubiquitous soil fungi, <I>Gliocladium virens</I> and <I>Trichoderma
harzianum</I>, have showed potential for suppressing Phytophthora
root rots of avocado and citrus in previous greehnouse experiments.
<P>
The results of this research demonstrate several important points,
including: 1) the excellent potential for some mulching materials,
such as yard waste, for improving growth of trees; 2) mulches
most beneficial to citrus and avocado roots are also efficient
substrates for some biocontrol agents; and 3) a huge urban problem
can be at least partially solved by diverting part of the waste
stream to citrus and avocado orchards.

<P>
<I>Committee on Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children,
National Academy of Sciences </I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press,
washington, DC. 1993  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study was congressionally
mandated in 1988. Its purpose was to examine the scientific and
policy issues faced by government agencies in regulating pesticide
residues in foods consumed by infants and children. The report
concluded that the federal government should change some of its
scientific and regulatory procedures to give infants and children
greater protection from possible adverse health effects of pesticides
in their diets. <BR>

<P>
The NAS report found age-related differences in susceptibility,
toxicity and exposure to pesticides between adults and children.
Children may be more or less sensitive than adults, depending
on the pesticide to which they are exposed. Due to rapidly changing
processes in infants and children, there is no simple way to predict
the sensitivity to these chemicals from data derived entirely
from adults. The NAS committee found, however, that quantitative
differences in toxicity between children and adults are usually
less than a factor of 10. Lack of data on pesticide toxicity in
developing organisms was a recurrent problem for the committee,
so they had to rely mostly on incomplete information derived from
studies of adult animals and on chemicals other than pesticides.
 <BR>

<P>
Differences in exposure to pesticides were generally more important
than were age-related differences in toxicological vulnerability.
The committee found that infants differ both qualitatively and
quantitatively from adults in their exposure to pesticide residues
in foods. Children consume more calories of food per unit of body
weight and much more of certain foods, especially processed foods,
than do adults. Water consumption, both as drinking water and
as a food component, is very different between adults and children.
Unfortunately, information on pesticide residues and the effects
of processing on residue concentrations is inadequate for foods
eaten by infants and children.  <BR>

<P>
To characterize potential risks to infants and children, the committee
used a statistical technique that took into account variations
in food intake and pesticide residue levels. The committee applied
this technique to determine health risks under three different
scenarios-acute toxic effects, chronic toxic effects, and simultaneous
exposure to several pesticides.  <BR>

<P>
On the basis of its findings, the committee recommends that changes
be made in current regulatory practices. Estimates of total exposure
to pesticide residues should reflect the unique characteristics
of the diets of infants and children and should account also for
all nondietary intake of pesticides. The committee also recommends
that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) modify its decision-making
process for setting tolerances so that it is based more on health
considerations than on agricultural practices. Now, although tolerances
establish enforceable legal limits for pesticide residues in food,
they are not based primarily on health considerations and do not
provide a good basis for inference about actual exposures of infants
arid children to pesticide residues. The committee states that
&quot;Children should be able to eat a healthful diet containing
legal residues without encroaching on safety margins.&quot; Specifically,
six areas should be addressed:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Toxicity testing. </B>Laboratory tests should be developed
for studying toxicity in immature animals to evaluate the sensitivities
of infants, children, and adolescents.  <BR>

<P>
<B>Uncertainty factors. </B>Currently, if animal tests show no
adverse effects at a certain exposure level, an uncertainty factor
of 100 is used to establish guidelines for human exposure. EPA
uses an additional factor of 10 if studies have shown effects
on the developing fetus. The report recommends expanding the use
of this additional uncertainty factor when there is evidence of
postnatal toxicity or when data from toxicity testing relative
to children are incomplete. <BR>

<P>
<B>Food consumption data. </B>The committee recommends that additional
data on the food consumption patterns of infants and children
be collected within narrower age groups. This would include at
every one-year interval up to age 5, between ages 5 and 10, and
between ages 11 and 18. These narrower groupings would result
in a more accurate portrayal of the ways children's diets differ
from those of adults.  <BR>

<P>
<B>Pesticide residue data. </B>The committee recommends the use
of comparable analytical methods and standardized reporting procedures
and the establishment of a computerized database to collate data
on pesticide residues from different labs.  <BR>

<P>
<B>Risk assessment. </B>All exposures to pesticides- dietary and
nondietary-need to be considered when evaluating the potential
risks to infants and children. Nondietary environmental sources
of exposure include air, dirt, indoor surfaces, lawns and pets.
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Estimation of cancer risk. </B>The committee recommended the
development of new methods that account for changes in exposure
and susceptibility that occur as a person matures.  <BR>

<P>
In summary, the NAS committee's recommendations support the need
to improve methods for estimating exposure and for setting tolerances
to safeguard the health of infants and children.  <BR>

<P>
Soil scientist <B>V. Philip Rasmussen</B> of Utah State University
has been named coordinator of the USDA Western Region Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program. Administrative
offices for the Western SARE Region will be relocated from the
University of California to Utah. However, the public information
office for the Western Region will remain at UC Davis; Kristen
Kelleher will continue as the key contact for the public and news
media at (916) 7525987. The move does not affect the UC's own
Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP)
based at UC Davis. <BR>
<BR>
The University of California has been host to the Western SARE
program since its beginnings in the late 1980s under the leadership
of <B>David E. Schlegel</B>, professor of plant pathology and
a UC administrator. Western Region grant administration will be
handled by Schlegel through 1994. USU will become the primary
contact for grants approved in the spring of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The SARE program, which began as the Low Input Sustainable Agriculture
(LISA) program in 1988, was renamed and authorized by Congress
as SARE in the 1990 Farm Bill. SARE is a competitive grants program
aimed at expanding food production and farming practices that
are environmentally sound, economically feasible and socially
responsible. The national program is directed regionally by four
councils which consist of farmers, scientists, land use experts
and administrators. <BR>

<H1>Agricultural labor research symposium.</H1>
<P>
<I>Labor Market Information Division, Employment Development Department,
State of California<BR>
</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Proceedings of a conference held June 5-6, 1991,
Napa, CA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This 164-page report highlights current developments in agricultural
labor, especially the growing importance of farm labor contractors
(FLCs) in California.  It is an edited transcript of the Farm
Labor Research Symposium held in Napa, California on June 5-6,
1991.  The symposium was a project of the Labor Market Information
Division of the state of California's Employment Development Department,
in cooperation with the UC Agricultural Personnel Program and
the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley.
<BR>
<P>
The symposium consisted of panels in three areas: farm worker
studies, farm labor contractor studies, and agricultural labor
management.  Sixteen panelists presented findings from their recent
research, and discussed with other panelists and audience members
the implications of those research findings.<BR>
<H3><B>Farm Worker Studies</B></H3>
<P>
In introducing the researchers on the farm worker studies panel,
Don Villarejo of the California Institute for Rural Studies noted
what made them unique.  Until recently, most of the relatively
scant information about farm workers was derived from the reports
of employers.  By contrast, the panelists assembled for this symposium
&quot;spend most of their time talking to farm workers.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
The panelists agreed that increased production of labor-intensive
commodities such as fruit and vegetables has increased labor needs
in agriculture over the past 10-20 years.  Despite this, and despite
the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), the flow of unauthorized
immigrants into the United States has contributed to an oversupply
of labor.  This oversupply leads to the underemployment of farm
workers and exacerbates their low economic status.  Existing services
to workers, such as housing, health care, workers' compensation
insurance, etc. are inadequate.  <BR>
<H3><B>Farm Labor Contractors</B></H3>
<P>
The Farm Labor Contractor panel was chaired by Ed Taylor of the
Agricultural Economics Department at UC Davis.  Taylor noted that
&quot;farm labor contractors are by far the most important single
employer group in California agriculture.&quot;  These contractors
are middle men who recruit labor for growers for a fee.  Most
licensed contractors face intense competition, some of it from
illegal FLCs, and operate with a very low profit margin.  To preserve
this margin, they often charge workers excessive fees for needed
services such as housing and transportation.  All the panelists
agreed with Taylor that, on average, workers hired by FLCs are
worse off than workers hired by other types of employers in California
agriculture.<BR>
<P>
While the stated intention of the IRCA reforms was to create a
smaller, more legal and regular work force, Taylor's study of
labor contractors suggests &quot;a picture of a farm labor market
that is still being fed by new and unauthorized immigrant workers.&quot;
 In this market, FLCs play an expanding and critical role.  A
key service to growers is the ability to avoid the employer sanctions
that were part of the IRCA reforms.  As Taylor puts it, &quot;In
fact, one could argue that evading employer sanctions may be an
important service that farm labor contractors are a buffer between
them, on the one hand, and labor laws, on the other.&quot;<BR>
<H3><B>Agricultural Labor Management</B></H3>
<P>
The third panel was chaired by Howard Rosenburg, director of the
UC Agricultural Personnel Management Program.  Panelists focused
on the role of alternative management practices in making the
most productive and efficient use of labor, in order to maintain
farm profitability.  As Rosenburg puts it, &quot;How workers perform
is determined by what they can do and what they want to do.  Personnel
management decisions affect both, and through them, ultimately,
business results and the quality of worklife for employees.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
The search for economically viable and socially just conditions
for labor remains a central task in the creation of a more sustainable
agriculture here in the state.  These proceedings represent a
timely and insightful look at agricultural labor in California.

<TITLE>San Joaquin Valley growers join UC scientists in novel farming projects (Press Release)</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR = #ffffff><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="/Images/sarephdr.gif" ALT="SAREP Header Icon"><BR CLEAR=all><HR>
<I> August 18, 1995</I><P>

<H2>San Joaquin Valley growers join UC scientists in novel farming
projects </H2>

<P>
San Joaquin Valley winegrape and row crop growers are teaming
up with University of California scientists in two pilot projects
to showcase innovative farming practices that reduce pesticide
use and improve soil quality.
<P>
The Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission (LWWC) and a group of
farmers and researchers in the San Joaquin Valley's Westside have
each been awarded money to demonstrate &quot;biologically integrated
farming systems&quot; (BIFS) on local farms and share that information
with other growers. The Commission has been allocated $100,000
to use local vineyards as &quot;classrooms&quot; for area growers
and to sponsor educational meetings on innovative farming practices.
The Westside group has been awarded $86,000 to conduct row crop
comparison studies and to share information on biologically integrated
farming practices with district growers. Authorization for the
projects comes from the Legislature's Assembly Bill 3383, which
was signed into law last year. Funding for the awards is provided
jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation. The program is administered
by the Davis-based UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Program (SAREP).
<P>
&quot;We are delighted to award these grants to two voluntary
researcher-farmergroups who have come together to deal with common
agricultural problems and reduce pesticide use,&quot; said SAREP
Director <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A>. &quot;Other projects similar to BIFS
have shown us that using a team approach coupling innovative farmers
with scientists is much more effective than regulations in helping
other growers adopt biologically integrated farming practices.&quot;
<P>
These farmers are integrating biological and cultural control
of pests into their production systems; providing on-farm habitats
for beneficial insects, mites and spiders; and emphasizing soil-building
practices such as cover crops to provide all or part of the nitrogen
needed by crops. The intended result, according to Liebhardt,
is that biologically integrated farming systems will enable farmers
to maintain yields and quality while greatly reducing their reliance
on agrichemicals, including pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.
<P>
BIFS is designed around a team approach to farm management, using
farmers, consultants, University of California farm advisors and
researchers, and independent pest-control advisers. Both projects
use successful working farms to demonstrate agricultural operations
that have reduced pesticide use in high-value crops. Other area
farmers have agreed to participate by adapting the methods demonstrated
to sections of their own farms and then monitoring and comparing
results with &quot;conventional&quot; plots.
<P>
&quot;The model of participatory extension and research in our
project is based on the premise that useful outcomes occur when
parties share goals and opportunities,&quot; said Jeff Mitchell,
a UC Cooperative Extension vegetable crops specialist and project
leader on the Westside project. &quot;The 13 farmer members of
our group are enthusiastic about this program because they want
workable alternatives to pesticides and methods to improve soil
quality, and they feel that UC researchers bring credibility to
the on-farm demonstrations. Our researchers feel that they will
benefit from direct involvement with farmers, which will allow
them to develop new and relevant problem-solving research opportunities.&quot;
<P>
Mark Chandler, the LWWC executive director and administrator of
the Commission's BIFS grant, notes that the Lodi-area coalition
of researchers and farmers is excited to be involved in a project
that will expand integrated pest management practices. &quot;Conventional
agriculture is looking for that 'shining example' of a district-wide,
commodity-based IPM program that demonstrates 'how it's done,'&quot;
he said. &quot;With this grant we hope to be that example.&quot;
<P>
The winegrape project is based on biologically integrated farming
methods that the Commission has been promoting since 1992. At
that time it began an integrated pest management program to promote
effective and rapid adoption of sustainable winegrape production
practices and to promote economic development in San Joaquin County
by cultivating a market niche for winegrapes produced with more
environmentally sensitive viticulture practices. According to
Chandler, the BIFS grant will help the Commission accomplish its
goal of extending adoption of sustainable practices throughout
the region.
<P>
The two model farms involved in the winegrape project are the
120-acre cabernet sauvignon vineyard owned by Lange Twins Farm,
and Kautz Farm's 30-acre zinfandel vineyard, both of which have
documented substantial reductions in pesticide use in the last
five years. Both farms have tracked the use of compost, cover
crops, beneficial insects and other farming practices.
<P>
The farmers who have signed up to participate in the winegrape
project will be evaluated by the BIFS team at the onset of the
project and will be monitored seasonally. The Commission will
conduct ongoing side-by-side comparisons ofyields and pesticide
use between the BIFS-farmed blocks and conventionally farmed blocks
on the farms of cooperating growers. The results of the comparisons
will be made available with other project data at monthly grower
meetings and field days and at smaller neighborhood grower meetings.
<P>
The Westside project is designed to facilitate information exchange
among area farmers, consultants and researchers on soil-building
practices and options for reduced reliance on agrichemicals. The
project will monitor and evaluate on-farm demonstrations of these
practices, determine the extent to which IPM practices are used
in row crops on the Westside and identify problems preventing
further adoption. It will also provide community demonstrations
of technologies while making use of participatory research teams
to develop and refine additional information. The project will
provide technical assistance to farmers and their consultants,
and intensive pest management monitoring of fields enrolled in
the project.
<P>
The farms used in the Westside project include O'Neill Farms,
a 7,200-acre diversified row crop operation near Five Points,
and John Diener's 4,500-acre farming operation between Five Points
and Huron. Side-by-side comparisons between conventionally managed
and biologically-based production systems will be established
on the 13 cooperator farms. A common Westside crop rotation of
tomatoes/cotton/onions-garlic will be followed at most sites.
<P>
Both BIFS pilot projects are funded for one year. Contingent upon
demonstrated progress, the projects will be eligible for renewed
funding for two additional years.

A primary function of the program is to provide funding for sustainable
agriculture-
related  research and education projects.  SAREP has awarded over $2
million in 
competitive grant monies over the past seven years (FY 1986/87 - FY
1992/93).  In FY 
1991/92 and FY 1992/93, SAREP provided over $440,000 in new and
continuing 
competitive grants.

To facilitate the transition to sustainable agriculture, farmers need
accurate 
information about the benefits, costs, and risks associated with
"conventional" and 
"alternative" systems.  To generate this information, research must
eventually be 
conducted at the whole-farm level.  By broadening the boundaries of
investigation, 
researchers are able to evaluate critically the success of farming
practices and 
their effects on the environment, as well as the special requirements
for adapting 
these practices to farms in various locations.<P>

The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and
quantify the  environmental and economic consequences of the transition
from conventional to low-
input and organic farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento
Valley.  The 
research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC
farm advisors 
play a key role in guiding the management decisions applied to the
various production 
systems.  The project was initiated in 1989 and is located on the UC
Davis Agronomy 
Farm.

Since 1990, SAREP has added an emphasis in economic, social, and public
policy 
research.  Proposals have addressed the links among sustainable
agriculture 
and public policy; labor policies and practices; land use; rural
community 
development; decision-making and the transition to sustainable
agriculture; 
and consumers and the food system.

Seasonal employment is considered a fact of life for California's
farm  workers, but a SAREP-sponsored study concludes that extended and
year-round 
employment for farm workers can be both feasible and profitable. The
two-year 
study examines the benefits and challenges for farmers who keep workers

employed "year-round" by leveling out the peaks and valleys of seasonal

employment. The results are available in a workbook, "Year-Round and
Extended

This study compares the economic benefits, energy costs, and social
values of 
different vegetable production farming practices at the Rural
Development 
Center (RDC) in Salinas, California.  Farmers at the RDC are
predominantly 
Mexican farm laborers enrolled in a three-year production and marketing

training program in which low-input production practices are
emphasized.  The 
effect of these alternative practices on the short- and long-term
well-being 
of the enrolled families and the surrounding rural community will be 
determined and analyzed based on information from the field,
interviews, and 
workshops.<P>

This project has formed a diverse coalition of community members to
address 
important agricultural issues in Santa Cruz County. Agriculture is a
$196 
million dollar industry in the county, second only to tourism.  It is 
threatened by urban growth and development, groundwater depletion, and
the 
movement of agricultural operations to other countries where costs are
lower.  
The community-based coalition will work with UC Santa Cruz to pool
resources, 
expertise, and political strength to assess needs, devise solutions,
and 
implement strategies for change.  The project also aims to improve 
agriculture's environmental responsibility and economic strength,
increase its 
responsiveness to the needs of those who work within the industry as
well as 
to local communities, and strengthen its links to the local community.

This project has developed a survey identifying the logistical,
economic, 
social, and regulatory barriers to bringing sustainably produced food
into 
Alameda County's food marketplace (in this project, sustainably
produced food 
refers to food that is locally grown and/or low-input or organically
grown).  
An advisory task force including wholesale and retail merchants, trade 
association members, consumers, and environmentalists was assembled in
the 
spring of 1992 to determine concerns of the food community about
barriers to 
the movement of sustainably produced food.  Surveys were developed to
collect 
baseline data regarding decision-making and buying criteria of retail
produce 
buyers, and to identify logistical, market, educational, or public
policy 
strategies to increase the availability of sustainably produced food in
the 
urban marketplace.<P>

This project organized five workshops throughout Humboldt and Del Norte

counties to address the topic of sustainable forestry management
options for 
small landowners.  The goal of sustainable forestry is shared by forest

landowners, legislators, and the public, yet is often difficult to
define and 
achieve.  Major changes in policies for the management of California's
14.4 
million acres of private forest land are evident in new and proposed 
legislation. Past laws and regulations that influenced cutting
practices, 
combined with natural events including fire and flood, have resulted in
many 
forest lands in need of restoration and improvement.  The costs of 
restoration, plus the costs imposed by legislative restrictions often 
discourage small landowners from long-term planning.  The workshops
looked at 
current legislation and policy instruments for implementing sustainable

forestry.  A dialogue between landowners, regulators, and legislators
was 
encouraged.<P>

sustainable agriculture projects by students, community members, and
local 
farmers.  The farm will be used as an educational facility to teach
university 
students sustainable small farm management skills, to offer classes to
local 
farmers and community members, and to give local youth groups a place
to 
experiment with sustainable agriculture and husbandry projects. 
Community

This study examines the interaction of agricultural variables and rural

community conditions in 75 communities in the Central Valley of
California.  
The following hypotheses will be tested:

<UL>
	<LI>Larger farms are associated with lower quality of community
life.
	<LI>Separation of farm management from ownership is associated with
lower 
quality of community life.
	<LI>Crop diversity is associated with higher quality of community
life.
	<LI>The rate of pesticide permit applications is negatively
associated with 
quality of community life.
</UL>

The California Institute for Rural Studies will provide very recent 
agricultural data on farm size, cropping patterns, residency of farm
managers, 
and pesticide permit applications which will be organized by zip codes.
 The 
availability of this data will allow a much closer focus on
agricultural 
issues than was previously possible.  On the social variables, the
project 
will continue to improve measures of community quality especially in
the area 
of ethnic relations (e.g., availability of quality schooling for
minority 
children, income differentials between white and non-white holders of
the same 
occupational positions, etc.).  In addition, the project will continue
to run 
the full battery of standard tests of community life quality: family
income 
levels, employment rates, and poverty index.  These two data sets will
then be 
merged to find out which agricultural variables significantly affect
the 
social variables in these 80 communities.<P>

These projects are characterized as basic or applied research on a
problem 
that is critical to the sustainable functioning of a particular system.
 
Projects must clearly demonstrate how the component in question is
critical to 
the system being studied, and how the results of the work will be
integrated 
into the whole production system.  Preference has been given to
projects that 
demonstrate involvement of farmers in the identification of the
research 
problem and potential solutions, and those that have a clear plan for 
implementation of research results.<P>

Control, Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier.<P>

The variegated leafhopper is the most important insect pest in the
vineyards 
of central California.  Most growers have relied on synthetic
insecticides to 
control this pest.  However, pesticide resistance and outbreaks of
secondary 
pests are creating the need for more sustainable approaches.  Most of
the work 
on biological control of leafhoppers has focused on Anagrus epos, a
tiny 
insect that parasitizes leafhopper eggs.  Little information has been 
developed on the complex of generalist leafhopper predators in
vineyards.  
Three types of predators were previously found to be common in
vineyards that 
had low leafhopper densities: spiders, predatory flies, and predaceous
mites.  
This project will better determine the role of these predators.<P>

An increasingly popular method for providing a suitable habitat within
the 
vineyard to maintain high populations of these predators is through the
use of 
cover crops.  However, little is known about the effects of cover crops
on 
natural enemies at specific times during the grape growing season. 
Therefore, 
this project will also determine if there are specific windows in time
in 
which the presence of a cover crop is critical.<P>

Another aspect of this project will be to determine if the type of
trellis 
system affects the population densities of the three predator groups
noted 
above.  Informal observation indicates that single-wire systems may be 
advantageous to certain spider species, while multiple-wire systems may

support others.  Finally, the trellis system and/or the presence of
cover 
crops alters the vineyard microclimate, possibly affecting the ability
of 
predators to survive.  Temperatures will be monitored in an attempt to 
establish a relationship between predator populations and
temperature.<P>

Cover crops in the pea family can be plowed under as green manure to
supply 
nitrogen to a wide range of crops.  Organic farmers commonly use this 
technique, but vegetables present some challenges.  For example, bell
pepper 
has a long growing season and a high demand for nitrogen, yet is
shallow 
rooted.  Thus, the timing of nitrate produced by the breakdown of cover
crop 
residues is important, so that growers can determine the need for
possible 
late-season nitrogen supplements. <P> 

This study will use a randomized complete block design to monitor bell
pepper 
production following incorporation of a Lana woollypod vetch cover
crop, with 
five levels of late-season nitrogen addition.  The nitrogen source will
be an 
approved organic material, and plots of one of the experimental
treatments 
will receive no supplemental nitrogen.  The researchers will use
innovative 
techniques to monitor nitrate in both the soil and the foliage of the
pepper 
plants.<P>

<p>One of the roles of a land grant university is to provide a forum and
develop solutions for the challenges of the day. Maintaining and enhancing
our natural resource base is one of the greatest challenges we face. SAREP's
existence within the University of California is based on the desire of
the state's citizens to keep the agricultural system, which is inextricably
linked to our natural resources, sustainable. To do this, it is vitally
important to prepare people to carefully manage our resources and production
systems, anticipating the long-term as well as short-term repercussions
of decisions. 
<br>The sustainable approach takes the view that we should use natural
systems as the model to achieve our goals. It employs agricultural practices
that do not disrupt nature, and indeed, may enhance it. At the same time,
the sustainable approach should bring economic stability to both the farmer
and the community. </p>

<p>In the last decade, many farmers and researchers have found that they
can develop sustainable farming systems by working together using participatory,
collaborative approaches to solving problems. Farmers have found that both
basic and applied research can be very helpful when used in a whole farm,
systems-view context. Researchers have also found value working in a co-learning
atmosphere with growers. 
<img src="/sarep/staff/images/bill.gif" alt="Image:" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0  align=right>
<br>Concrete approaches to improving sustainability in a collaborative
environment include the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
and the Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) projects. Management
teams including SAREP, other UC researchers, non-profit organizations,
and farm groups are at the heart of these models. Both projects employ
a systems-view of agriculture, using soil management as the key to biological
integration. They demonstrate the feasibility of farming using natural
systems. </p>

<p>In addition to these special programs, SAREP has funded a diverse group
of projects in production agriculture, food systems, and economics and
public policy. We see these as examples that demonstrate the integration
and interconnectedness between the people who produce and consume our food
and fiber, and the natural resources necessary to make this production
possible. Our staff is working to encourage collaboration and stewardship
throughout the state with UC research and extension personnel, farmers
and consumers. To keep California's production systems alive and well,
we will continue to encourage practices and policies that enhance our natural
resources. We at SAREP are pleased to work with people from different backgrounds
and experiences to build cooperative management that is aware of its impact
on the future. </p>

<h2 align=center><a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION </h2>

<p>In 1986 the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 872, the Sustainable
Agriculture Act, to 
<br>address some of these complex issues. The Act requested that the University
of California establish the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education
Program (SAREP) to promote agricultural production and distribution methods
that adopt more resource-conserving, energy efficient systems. SAREP was
established in the fall of 1986.</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>SAREP Goals 
<br></font></b>The goal of the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and
Education Program is to support scientific research and education required
for the development of more economically viable, environmentally sensitive,
and socially responsible agricultural practices and policies, and to disseminate
this information to farmers, ranchers, researchers, policymakers and other
interested parties. </p>

<p>The 1986 Sustainable Agriculture Act defines SAREP's three main responsibilities:
</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Administration of Competitive Research Grants 
<br></font></b>The program has awarded over $2.6 million to approximately
161 basic and applied research projects, economic and public policy research
projects, seminars and field demonstrations, and graduate student grants.
These projects include studies of sustainable cropping systems, animal
husbandry, habitat enhancement for biological pest management, economic
analyses of farming systems, and topics in community development, marketing,
public policy and consumer education related to sustainable food systems.
</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Development and Distribution of Information 
<br></font></b>SAREP has collected, organized and distributed information
through the program's quarterly newsletter and other publications, videos,
and databases, many of which are now accessible on the Internet. The program's
World Wide Web Home Page includes links to information about SAREP-funded
projects, newsletter articles, and requests for proposals for competitive
grant programs. SAREP has also sponsored, co-sponsored, or supported many
workshops, conferences and seminars that share the results of research
and extend it to a variety of audiences throughout the state. </p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>The Support of Long-Term Farmland Studies 
<br></font></b>In 1990, SAREP helped fund the first 100-year, irrigated
farmland research site in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.
SAREP continues to fund research that addresses long-term issues related
to sustaining California agriculture and the natural and human resources
upon which it depends. </p>

<p>In the nine years since its inception, SAREP has been a catalyst within
California agriculture, in its communities and within the land grant university
system nationwide to find solutions to the complex problems we face. This
report summarizes SAREP's activities in FY 1993/1994 and FY 1994/1995,
beginning where <b>Progress Report 1990-1993 </b>ends. </p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>Public and Technical Advisory Committees 
<br></font></b>Public and technical advisory committees advise SAREP on
its goals and make recommendations on the award of competitive grants.
The Public Advisory Committee includes individuals actively involved in
agricultural production (large, medium and small-sized conventional and
organic growers), as well as members from government, consumer and environmental
organizations. The Technical Advisory Committee is made up of faculty,
specialists and farm advisors throughout the state with knowledge and experience
in diverse areas related to sustainable agriculture. Individuals on the
public and technical advisory committees serve three-year terms with some
members rotating off each year. The diverse composition of SAREP's Public
and Technical Advisory Committees reflects the breadth of our goals. </p>

of 9.6 full-time positions, of which 1.5 full-time positions are paid for
by external sources of funding. All but one staff member is located at
UC Davis. The staff administers and manages SAREP's competitive grants
program as well as the Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) program
grants, and also gathers, synthesizes, and distributes a wide variety of
information about sustainable food and agricultural systems throughout
California. Areas addressed by SAREP staff include annual cropping systems,
tree and vine crops, cover crops, pest management, soil quality and management,
restoration ecology, economics and public policy, farmworker issues, consumer
issues, nutrition and sustainable food systems, and biotechnology and sustainable
agriculture. </p>

<p>Staff also focus on education and outreach through the program's quarterly
newsletter, SAREP's World Wide Web server on the Internet, an interactive
sustainable agriculture electronic mail network, the production of numerous
publications, and participation in various conferences and training events.
</p>

<p>After years of being split into offices at two locations, SAREP staff
members all moved to the new UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources
(DANR) building on Hopkins Road in the far west section of the UC Davis
campus in December 1994. The program shares the building with the UC Small
Farm Center, the Genetic Resources Conservation Program, and the offices
of the directors of DANR's North Region and North Central Region. </p>

<h2 align=center><a name="COMPETITIVE"></a>COMPETITIVE GRANTS PROGRAM </h2>

<p><img src="/sarep/pubs/progressreport/images/easel.gif" alt="Images: row of crops" hspace=10 vspace=10 border=0  align=right></p>

<p>A primary function of the program is to offer grant money for research
and education projects. SAREP has awarded over $2.6 million in grant monies
for 161 projects over the last nine fiscal years (FY 1986/87 - FY 1994/95).
In FY 1993/94 and FY 1994/95, SAREP spent over $367,000 in new and continuing
competitive grants. These projects fall into two general areas: economics
and public policy and sustainable agricultural production. SAREP has also
funded one cropping systems comparison project for the last seven years.
This project will be described first, followed by new and continuing projects
funded in FY 1993/94 and FY 1994/95 and older projects that have submitted
final reports in the last two years.</p>

<p>Many of the other projects SAREP funded in previous funding cycles have
now been completed. SAREP has worked with investigators to publicize results
through the program's newsletter, university information channels, conferences,
and electronic and print media for the public. These projects are also
described in <b>SAREP's Progress Report 1986-1990</b> and <b>Progress Report
1990-1993.</b>

<p>The goal of this long-term research project is to describe and quantify
the environmental, agronomic and economic consequences of the transition
from conventional farming systems typical of the southern Sacramento Valley
to systems that are less dependent on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.
The research team is multidisciplinary and participating farmers and UC
Cooperative Extension farm advisors play a key role in guiding the management
decisions applied to the various production systems. By broadening and
integrating the scope of investigation, researchers have been able to critically
evaluate the success of different farming practices and their effects on
the environment, as well as the special requirements for adapting alternative
practices to farms in other locations. </p>

<h2 align=center>Rotations and experimental design </h2>

<p>The project was initiated in FY 1988/1989, and is located on 28 acres
at the UC Davis Agronomy Farm. The main experiment occupies about 20 acres
and compares four cropping systems: 1) a conventional two-year rotation;
2) a conventional four-year rotation; 3) a low-input four-year rotation;
and 4) an organic four-year rotation. The four systems are arranged in
a split-plot design with four replicates of each system. All the cropping
systems include processing tomatoes, a high-value commodity grown on approximately
310,000 acres in California (1990 data). Other cash crops grown include
wheat, safflower, field corn, and beans. In addition, winter-spring cover
crops are grown in the low-input and organic systems. The specific rotations
used in the different management systems are shown in Figure 1. Each replicate
of the four systems started the rotation in 1989 with a different entry
point in the sequence of crops. </p>

<p><b>Both conventional systems </b>are managed using practices typical
for the southern Sacramento Valley. The two-year conventional system is
practiced by farmers when short-term profit must be maximized. <b>The low-input
system</b> includes a winter cover crop prior to planting tomatoes, safflower,
corn and beans. While trying to reduce dependency on non-renewable resources,
synthetic fertilizers or pesticides may be used in the low-input system
to maintain the profitability of the operation. <b>The organic system</b>
is managed according to the certification requirements of California Certified
Organic Farmers (CCOF); only approved fertilizers and pesticides are used.
&quot;Best farmer&quot; management practices are used in all systems. For
example, insect and disease management decisions for all systems are based
on periodic monitoring of pest levels, and no pesticides are applied until
economic threshold levels are exceeded. </p>

<p>A companion research area of eight acres is being used to test alternative
grain and cover crop legumes that could be used as cash crops, as winter
and summer cover crops, or in intercropping systems in California. Along
with this effort, investigators are evaluating various kinds of agricultural
equipment for use in reduced tillage operations and innovative cover crop
management. </p>

<h2 align=center>Observations and results </h2>

<p>Researchers have been collecting data on: crop growth, yield and quality;
soil biology; soil fertility; soil organic matter levels; soil water infiltration
rates; weeds, pest and beneficial insect populations, and disease levels;
and economic performance. Some of the key findings and questions for future
research are summarized below. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Crop growth and yield</b>. Soil fertility and weed management have
been identified as the most important factors limiting yields in the organic
and low-input systems. Project managers have altered production practices
to address these constraints. Organic and low-input tomatoes, for example,
are now transplanted instead of direct seeded. This practice leaves more
time for cover crop growth, gives tomatoes a head start in competing against
weeds and allows for the use of efficient mechanical cultivation techniques.
Manure fertilizers and foliar sprays have also improved yields in the organic
systems. Nonetheless, it has been difficult to obtain the high quality
transplants necessary for optimal growth and yield. In the 1994 growing
season, for example, researchers found that transplants in the organic
and low-input systems were infected with a virus. Symptoms became apparent
four to six weeks after transplanting, and yields in the organic and low-input
systems were lower than in the conventional systems. </p>

<p><b>Soil biology and fertility</b>. Nitrogen availability appears to
be an important factor determining tomato yields during the transition
to organic production. Prior to 1992, tomato plants in the organic system
were stunted and yellow early in the season, did not compete well with
weeds, and had yields lower than tomatoes grown under conventional methods.
These results were despite the fact that soil nitrate levels in the organic
tomatoes in 1990 and 1991 were actually higher than or equivalent to levels
in the conventional system. The reason for this phenomenon is probably
related to the importance of microbial activity in an organic system. Unlike
the conventional system where plants obtain nutrients from highly soluble
chemical sources, the organic and low-input systems rely on microorganisms
to make nutrients available for plant uptake. Through the first four years
of the rotation, it has been determined that the low-input and organic
systems derived 85 percent of their nitrogen from the vetch cover crop
that was incorporated into the soil and broken down by microbes. </p>

<p>To measure the importance of soil microbial activity, researchers looked
closely at changes in microbial biomass carbon over the growing season.
Microbial biomass carbon is an estimate of both the size of the total microbial
community and the mass of potential plant nutrients contained within the
cells of the microorganisms. This variable was measured in tomato plots
four times between March and September in both 1990 and 1992. Levels of
microbial biomass carbon fluctuated similarly in all systems over the growing
season. In 1990 the only significant differences among the four farming
systems occurred following the early April incorporation of the cover crop,
at which time the microbial biomass carbon was higher in the organic and
low-input systems. In 1992 microbial biomass carbon was higher in the organic
and low-input systems throughout the growing season. </p>

<p>Related studies have shown some interesting differences in nematode
populations among the four farming systems. Nematodes can be classified
by what they feed on: bacteria, fungi, plants, or other nematodes. In the
two conventional systems, the total numbers of all nematodes in the soil
(to 30 cm depth) did not change significantly between 1988 and 1992. In
contrast, during the same period, there were significant decreases in the
total number of nematodes in the low-input and organic systems. Bacterial
feeding nematodes are of particular interest because of their role in mineralizing
nitrogen. Thirteen of these species have been identified in this research
site. The proportion of all nematodes that are bacterial feeders declined
over the four years in the two conventional systems, increased in the low-input
system and declined in the organic system. The decline in the organic system
is surprising given the high levels of microbial biomass measured in those
plots. Researchers suggest that the late sampling date for nematodes may
have been responsible for this discrepancy. </p>

<p><b>Insects, Weeds and Diseases. </b>The shift from conventional to low-input
or organic pest control did not result in large increases in relative abundance
of most pest species over the period of this study. However, there were
some significant short-term problems in individual farming systems. Significantly
greater damage occurred in organic and low-input plots due to tomato fruitworm
in 1989 and stink bugs in 1992, while insecticides prevented damage to
conventional plots. Similarly, the cover crop residue appeared to increase
damage by seed corn maggot to safflower and corn in two consecutive years.
Verticillium increased in soils on the conventional two-year plots, probably
because of the increased frequency of tomato plantings in this system.
The presence of the disease organism, however, does not seem to have affected
yields in those plots. Bacterial spot of processing tomato was severe in
the spring of 1993, due to rain and a hailstorm. Aerial treatments were
not practical for the small plots in this study, but by the time the fields
had dried sufficiently for ground application, the weather was hot and
dry, stopping the epidemic. Rust occurred every year on all safflower plots.
However, it was not observed to cause yield loss. Corn smut was observed
in all plots, but the level of its incidence remained below the treatment
threshold. </p>

<p>Weeds were a problem in all systems, but the different control methods
employed in each system favored the growth of several key species. In the
low-input and organic systems, barnyardgrass has become a significant problem.
In the conventional systems, field bindweed and nightshade have been more
problematic. The shift to these weed species has resulted in modifications
to the control strategies, including herbicide changes or increased cultivation
frequency, but there has been little or no change in total weed cover.
The vagaries of the weather presented an added challenge in low-input and
organic systems. For example, the wet spring in 1993 prevented timely cultivation
and resulted in increased weed competition in the organic corn where herbicides
were not used. </p>

<p><b>Economics.</b> Results to date suggest that similar crop yields may
be obtained when &quot;best farmer&quot; management practices are used
in each of the different systems. Similar yields, however, do not necessarily
translate into similar profits. The yields and organic price premiums of
tomatoes, and year-to-year variation in production costs for each system
were the most important factors determining relative whole-farm profit
(Figure 2). During the 1991 growing season, for example, gross returns,
per acre operating costs, and net returns above total costs were all highest
in the conventional two-year rotation (all crops combined). The 1992 season,
by contrast showed that the organic systems had the highest figures in
each of these same categories. Reduced whole-farm profits per acre in the
1993 and 1994 seasons can be attributed to problems with tomato transplants
as described earlier. </p>

<p>Results of this study support what other studies have found: The transition
period (as evidenced by the performance of the low-input system) carries
significant risk. There are no price premiums for &quot;transitional commodities,&quot;
costs of production may be high, growers are generally on the steep part
of the learning curve, and the new production system can be ecologically
unstable for a time. </p>

<h2 align=center>Conclusions </h2>

<p>From the standpoint of crop performance and yield, it appears that a
rotation of processing tomatoes, safflower, field corn and wheat or winter
legume, followed by double-cropped dry beans, is a good crop rotation on
which to make systems comparisons. The use of nitrogen-fixing winter cover
crops for green manure and as seed crops has merit, but also resulted in
crop management challenges that required &quot;best farmer&quot; experience
and flexibility to work within the constraints imposed by time and weather.
The late winter, early spring management of cover crops, including residue
management, seedbed preparation, supplemental manuring and the retention
of sufficient soil moisture to germinate tomatoes, corn and safflower has
become a central research theme for continuing studies in the large companion
plots adjacent to the main experiment. The interdisciplinary group is focusing
on several key issues as the project continues its second rotation cycle.
These include identifying the best cover crops for each system/season combination
and observing phenomena that have an impact on soil fertility and plant
nutrition, particularly the season-long monitoring of cover crop nitrogen,
crop growth and yield. The long-term implications of weed control, as well
as the related demand for creative management and appropriate equipment,
are critical. </p>

<p>Conclusions about the preferable crop with which to enter the rotation
are still premature. The attractive premiums offered for organically grown
tomatoes, and regulations that specify a minimum of three years without
pesticides prior to certification, suggest that field corn would be the
best starting point of the rotation, but pest control (and especially weed
management) implications of this choice must be considered. Choices will
also depend on the grower's economic situation and a consideration of the
wide range of costs and returns for the five cash crops in the rotation.
The challenges of managing winter cover and grain legume cash crops without
herbicides (organic), or with short-lived, post-emergence herbicides (low-input),
are at least partially offset by the opportunities to plant or replant
catch crops, such as spring barley after lupine and pink beans after safflower
in this study. </p>

<p>One of the critical issues facing California agriculture is its interaction
with nearby communities. Regions are being forced to come to terms with
preserving agriculture in the face of increasing market, development and
population pressures. Realizing that addressing these issues would need
to be a community process, individuals formed a coalition in Santa Cruz
County in the fall of 1991 with funding from SAREP. The goal of this Agriculture
and Community Project (AgComm) coalition was to examine the status of agriculture
in Santa Cruz County and collaborate with the local community to ensure
its long-term viability. Principal investigators Steve Gliessman and Jim
Pepper organized and directed the initial planning committee which was
composed of representatives of a broad base of community interests. After
meeting for a year (May 1992-May 1993), the planning committee defined
topics which provided the foundation for specific areas of research and
became the basis of the agenda for a communitywide forum held November
20, 1993 in Aptos. At this forum, participants examined ways in which the
entire community is connected to agriculture and explored strategies to
broaden and strengthen this connection. Local residents were particularly
interested in community education, encouraging the community to buy locally
grown foods and find common ground between urban and agricultural interests.
</p>

<p>Concurrently, the planning committee's work led to directed research
by the AgComm staff about land use, farmland preservation and farmworker
housing. Exploration of policy options by the AgComm staff included research
on agriculture elements that have been drafted or approved under General
Plan law in 11 counties in California. As a result of their work on land
preservation, the Agricultural Policy Advisory Commission to the local
Board of Supervisors asked the AgComm group to advise them on issues such
as agriculture at the urban edge. Should the Board of Supervisors and the
County Planning Department decide to pursue an agricultural element, work
on the General Plan elements will be compiled along with recommendations
for proceeding. </p>

<p>In the fall of 1994, the continuing interest in land preservation policies
led the AgComm group to conduct a &quot;mobile workshop&quot; or bus tour
for local agriculture leaders, planning officials and policymakers on &quot;Preserving
Agricultural Land on the Edge: Ag Land Preservation Techniques.&quot; A
workbook with articles describing the tools and techniques for preserving
agricultural land was produced for this mobile workshop and is available
for purchase from the AgComm Project. For more information, contact: Kerstin

<p>This project surveyed retail produce buyers in order to: 1) gather demographic
data on the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in Alameda County
food markets; 2) determine produce buyer criteria for selecting fresh produce;
3) assess buyers' attitudes toward sustainably produced food; and 4) identify
characteristics of consumers who shop where fresh fruits and vegetables
are available. The study found that only 27 percent of the 819 markets
in Alameda County eligible to accept food stamps handle any significant
amount of fruits and vegetables. When selecting produce, buyers listed
quality and appearance first with variety, price, and consumer needs ranking
lower. Wholesale terminals or distributor/brokers were about evenly used.
Buyers had very little knowledge of sustainable agriculture and only one
fourth had heard of sustainable or organic agriculture. Despite this, they
ranked the values of sustainable agriculture as being very important. An
Advisory Task Force connected with the project recommended that strategies
to develop relationships with small/medium scale grocers should be emphasized
as a way of expanding the market for sustainably produced food. For more

<p>The Rural Development Center (RDC) is a community-based agricultural
training and resource center which offers educational programs and practical
experience opportunities to farmers and low-income people in the Salinas
Valley. In this project, the RDC conducted a follow-up study of former
students to assess the impact of the program on them and the extent to
which program goals were met. Interviews with former students sought information
about the motivations, difficulties and barriers to becoming a small-scale
farmer in the Salinas Valley; the implications of adopting and using sustainable
practices; and the skills, knowledge, and personal characteristics that
contribute to the development of successful and sustainable farms by former
farmworkers. The study found that participants in RDC programs have gained:
1) practical farming and business skills and experience; 2) confidence
in their abilities to realize objectives and achieve goals; 3) exposure
to sustainable agricultural methods which they had not seen or heard about
in California agriculture as they had previously experienced it; and 4)
a network of support for farmer-to-farmer information exchange and assistance,
family integration and involvement of children. The study found that networks
of community support and interaction are key factors in the success of

<h2 align=center>EXAMINATION OF THE INTERACTION OF AGRICULTURAL

<br></b><i>Don&nbsp;Villarejo, executive director, California Institute
for Rural Studies, Davis</i> </p>

<p>This study examines the interaction of agricultural variables and rural
community conditions in 75 communities in the Central Valley of California.
The following hypotheses will be tested: </p>

<ul>
<li>Larger farms are associated with lower quality of community life; </li>

<li>Separation of farm management from ownership is associated with lower
quality of community life; </li>

<li>Crop diversity is associated with higher quality of community life;
and</li>

<li>The rate of pesticide permit applications is negatively associated
with quality of 
<br>community life. </li>
</ul>

<p>Although these hypotheses are framed within the same general theoretical
perspective as previous macrosocial accounting projects, this project uses
current and much better data provided by the California Institute for Rural
Studies (CIRS). These data were originally coded by CIRS from mandated
pesticide application permit forms and include information about the crop(s),
field sizes, address of applicant, location of the fields, etc. The availability
of this data and the quality of measurements will allow a much better focus
on agricultural issues than was previously possible. On the social variables,
the project will continue to improve measures of community quality especially
in the area of ethnic relations (availability of quality schooling for
minority children, income differentials between white and non-white holders
of the same occupational positions, etc.). In addition, the project will
continue to run the full battery of standard tests of community life quality:
family income levels, employment rates, and poverty indices. These two
data sets will then be merged to find out which agricultural variables
significantly affect the social variables in these 75 communities. An analysis
of variance and several correlation matrices have been completed preparatory
to the regression analysis. The results of these preliminary tests suggest
that improvements in the quality of the data bases will have a noticeable
impact on the results and that strong regression models can be built of
the relationship between agricultural structure and community conditions.

incorporate ethics into their decisions and practices. The curriculum uses
written case studies that include a narrative description of the case,
as well as questions and discussion topics that provoke participants to
measure the case against their ethical criteria or their notions of socially
shared values. The cases include Saltwater Intrusion in the Central Valley;
Selling Small Fruit Illegally; Levi Strauss: Selling Jeans, Promoting Ethics;
General Mills Cereal Contamination and others. These materials have been
tested on a variety of audiences: workshops at farm conferences, farm advisor
and specialist workgroup meetings, and university classes. The tests indicate
that the material as well as the pedagogical approach are very successful
in stimulating thought and dialogue about ethics as it relates to the food

<p>This project has provided a forum for the development of new and creative
pesticide reduction policy options tailored to California's specific situation.
During Year 1, the Pesticide Action Network of North America (PANNA) consulted
with 46 leaders in California agriculture to discuss pesticide use reduction
policy options. These discussions led to a draft pesticide use reduction
plan for California. The plan, to be used in ongoing policy discussions,
calls on policy makers to: 1) establish a numerical use reduction goal
that is voluntary and ambitious, at least 50 percent reduction of use in
the state by the year 2000 measured against a base year of 1992; 2) establish
specific reduction strategies by sector by consulting with all affected
parties and communities; 3) phase out high-hazard pesticides according
to specific criteria based on impacts to human health and the environment;
4) increase funding for alternative agriculture research through competitive
grant programs; 5) develop a program of financial incentives for growers
in transition to alternative agricultural practices; and 6) develop a pesticide
fee-based mechanism for funding both research and extension alternatives
and financial incentive programs. </p>

<p>During Year 2 the researchers produced a report Financial Incentives
and Their Potential to Reduce Pesticide Use in Three California Crops:
Cotton, Oranges, and Strawberries. The report was based upon direct interviews
with farmers, pest control advisors and Cooperative Extension personnel,
supplemented by meetings and other communication with participants in PANNA's
pesticide use reduction work. The study identifies a variety of financial
incentive options, and analyzes their potential utility in ongoing policy
discussions. The financial incentives considered include: cost-share, tax
credits, modified price support programs, crop insurance, technical assistance,
specially licensed pest control advisors, increased regulation of high
hazard pesticides and pesticide use, and agricultural land preservation.

<p>The Arcata Farm and Education Project demonstrates how a small project
can spark creative connections that promote a more sustainable community
food system. The two-acre, student-run community farm is the result of
cooperation between Humboldt State University, Cooperative Extension, the
City of Arcata, and local farmers and educators. The project has five major
objectives: to use the farm as an educational facility to teach university
students about sustainable small farm management skills; to operate the
farm using community supported agriculture (CSA) principles and to assess
the feasibility of the CSA in the region; to develop and incorporate curriculum
for local elementary and high schools; to facilitate communication about
agriculture in the community by involving local farmers, refugee farmers
and community members in classes and activities at the farm; and to give
community youth groups access to the facility as a place to experiment
with animal husbandry and sustainable agriculture projects. A manual, a
slide set, and possibly a video are being developed that will describe
the farm's activities, how it has overcome problems, and lessons for other
communities. For more information, contact: Peter Lehman, Humboldt State

(SAWG) in 1993, which held its initial meeting on October 8-9, 1994 to
gather a broad cross-section of individuals and groups with interests related
to sustainable agriculture for the purpose of: 1) identifying key SAWG
objectives and purposes; 2) identifying opportunities for collaboration
and cooperation among the groups; 3) educating one another about needed
policies to support sustainable agriculture in the state; and 4) learning
about local, state and national policy processes. This meeting was the
first statewide public forum for information exchange and strategic thinking
around state and national sustainable agriculture policy issues. As a result

<p>Most apples are treated with the antioxidant diphenylamine (DPA) before
cold storage to prevent the development of storage scald. This project
examined the effects of hot water dips before cold storage on Granny Smith
apples in an effort to find an alternative means of scald control. The
hot water treatments were compared to controlled atmosphere, DPA, and hot
air treatments. </p>

<p>In this project, the apples were immersed for varying lengths of time
in 46, 48, 50, and 52 C water before storage at 0.5 C for three and
six months. While scald development and severity were reduced, no treatment
provided 100 percent control. Higher temperatures or longer immersion times
were more effective at reducing scald. Most heat treatments resulted in
increased firmness of apples after storage, particularly after six months,
compared with non-heated apples. Controlled atmosphere and DPA treatments
gave the best scald control, followed by the hot air treatment of 38 C
for four days. The best hot water treatments were 50 C for five minutes
and 48 C for 15 minutes. It does not appear that hot water dips will be
a commercially feasible treatment for the apple industry because of the
lack of adequate scald control and the risk of fruit injury. </p>

<p>Hot water dips were also tested on pomegranates and kiwifruit. Treatments
of pomegranates with hot water were not successful in preventing chilling
injury or controlling decay. Kiwifruit decay control experiments were also
unsuccessful primarily due to lack of Botrytis rot development in inoculated
fruit. For more information, contact: Elizabeth Mitcham, Department of

<h2 align=center>RELEASE OF NITROGEN FROM A LEGUMINOUS COVER CROP

<p>Leguminous cover crops begin to release nitrogen to the soil once they
are incorporated into the soil if adequate water is available for microbial
decomposition of the plant tissue. The amount of nitrogen that is released
from a productive cover crop can be substantial, however the rate of release
of nitrogen and the duration of the release is not well understood. In
this study, researchers investigated the rate of release of nitrogen from
Lana vetch and its subsequent utilization by bell peppersa long-season,
high-nitrogen demanding vegetable. They also treated some plots with superimposed
applications of a slow-release fertilizer (feather meal) to determine if
the additional nitrogen, supplemental to the cover crop, provided season-long
nitrogen to the crop. </p>

<p>In 1992, there was a steady increase in the nitrate-nitrogen levels
of the soil solution up to 74 days following incorporation of vetch residue
into moist soil. This release of nitrogen from the vetch followed an earlier
trend observed in 1991 in a sweet corn field. The release curve of nitrogen
by vetch fit the growth pattern nicely for some vegetables such as sweet
corn and melons. These crops have their peak demand for nitrogen at the
time when the cover crop is releasing a maximum amount of nitrogen. </p>

<p>For bell pepper, the 1992 data indicates that the nitrogen supplied
by the cover crop alone did not keep the petiole nitrate-N levels as high
as plots that were amended with slow release fertilizer, which supplied
late season nitrogen to the pepper crop. However, there was no significant
improvement in yield from any of the fertilizer treatments, possibly because
of a late-season disease outbreak. In 1993 the petiole nitrate-N levels
again increased later in the growing season in the fertilized plots and
the yield in the plot fertilized with 160 pounds of nitrogen as feather
meal had a significantly higher yield. </p>

<p>These results indicate that the nitrogen released from a leguminous
cover crop such as vetch can provide significant amounts of nitrogen for
subsequent vegetable crop production. However, long-season, high-nitrogen
demanding crops such as bell peppers may need supplemental applications
of late season fertilizer for optimal growth. For more information, contact:

<h2 align=center>EVALUATING DRYLAND LEGUMES AND NATIVE PERENNIAL GRASSES

<p>In this project, researchers evaluated dryland legumes and native perennial
grasses for use in pasture, range, vineyard, and other farming systems
in northern California. The plants were evaluated for adaptability, persistence,
weed suppression, and management requirements. Specific components of this
project included: field trials with dryland legumes; establishment and
maintenance of a demonstration nursery; curating a large collection of
cultivars, experimental lines, and wildland species (California natives);
increasing seed of material for future trials; and providing seed to researchers,
farm advisors, and producers. </p>

<p>The researchers planted 71 accessions of annual medics (Medicago spp.)
comprising 15 species. Many of these accessions performed poorly. In general,
performance of many of the medics was excellent in the first year and poor
the second year for a number of reasons. Overall, bur medic (Medicago polymorpha)
appears to be the most promising annual medic for California. Some of the
48 accessions of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) performed
quite well. As a group, the short season accessions of subterranean clover
produced less cover than mid- or long-season lines, but they may be among
the most persistent because they finish their life cycle before soil moisture
is depleted. Another important factor relating to long-term persistence
is hard-seededness, a characteristic that most subclovers do not have.
</p>

<p>Some of the practical implications from this research are: 1) seeding
recommendations should rarely if ever be made that are based on short-term
data; 2) long-term performance of dryland legumes is very site-specific;
for this reason, large-scale seedings should be preceded by variety trials,
or at least variety trials should be included along with the plantings;
3) the seed mixes that are assembled by most companies and sold as dryland
mixes will usually contain a large percentage of seed that is of little
long-term value on the site where it is planted; and 4) many of the cultivars
developed in Australia that apparently perform well there may not show
an equivalent response here. For more information, contact Craig Thomsen,

<p>There is a growing trend in the California almond industry toward noncultivation
and cover cropping. The majority of cover crops used are resident weed
species, but almond growers need to know if certain planted cover crops
may have advantages over resident vegetation. In this project, ten cover
crop mixes were planted in an almond orchard in November 1992. In addition,
almond orchards of five innovative growers were monitored in a previously
funded SAREP project. The project compared the effects of cover crops on
soil and tree nutrition, insect populations, mowing frequency, and orchard
floor preparation at harvest. </p>

<p>Leaf nitrogen levels in all plots and on all orchard comparisons remained
adequate during the experiments. In the cover crop treatments, ladybird
beetles were highest in the Beneficial Blend, Insectary mix, vetch and
clovers; they were low in the resident vegetation, Blando brome, Zorro
fescue, and bur medic. In the orchard comparisons, ladybird beetles were
high in the established vetch/clover mixes and in the tall resident vegetation.
The numbers of parasitic wasps were highly variable, but there was a trend
toward higher numbers in the planted cover crops and fewer in the resident
vegetation. Plant feeding and beneficial mites varied among the comparison
orchards. However, in measurements taken over seven years, two-spotted
spider mites have very seldom been an economic problem in heavily cover-cropped,
unsprayed almond orchards. Almond rejects caused by peach twig borer and
navel orangeworm were usually quite low in the comparison orchards. </p>

<p>The extension of the results of this research were as impressive as
the actual results. In addition to the six field tours held from 1993 to
1995, dozens of almond growers in Merced and Stanislaus counties benefited
directly from this research in the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS) project. BIOS was coordinated by the Community Alliance with Family
Farmers (CAFF) Foundation, with extensive input from SAREP. The project
was also featured in the January/February 1995 issue of UC's California
Agriculture magazine. For more information, contact: Lonnie Hendricks,

<p>Lettuce drop is a widespread soilborne disease of lettuce in the Salinas
Valley and other coastal lettuce growing regions. The disease causes substantial
economic loss when sclerotia, the resting structures of the pathogen, build
up in the soil. Resistant cultivars are not available, and growers rely
on synthetic fungicides for managing the disease. Cover crops may influence
sclerotial levels by either acting as host plants or as organic substrates;
in both cases, sclerotia may increase in the soil. Conversely, cover crops
may increase soil microbial diversity and actually help reduce disease
incidence or severity. This study, now in its third year, is evaluating
selected cover crops to see whether lettuce drop is increased or decreased.
</p>

<p>Two years of the study indicate that Phacelia, two species of vetch,
and Austrian pea became significantly infected by this pathogen. Cover
crops were incorporated in March, allowed to decompose for a period of
time, and followed with a lettuce crop (planted early June). In early August,
the investigators began to evaluate the lettuce crop for disease. At this
time, Phacelia and purple vetch plots had significantly more disease than
the fallow control. The data collected during the first and second years
of this study indicate that some of these cover crops can support the pathogen,
resulting in increased lettuce drop. It should be noted that this is a
small plot study that used high inoculum density to induce disease. </p>

<p>In the third year of the study, sudangrass is being investigated for
suppressing lettuce drop. Broccoli residues and manure/yard waste compost
will also be evaluated for disease suppression. For more information, contact:

<p>Increasing soil organic matter favors growth of desirable bacteria and
fungi, but little is known about the mechanisms by which living plants,
crop residues, and green manures promote growth of soil microbes. This
project is identifying and quantifying small organic molecules that move
from plant material to soil microorganisms. The goal is to discover natural
products that trigger growth of beneficial, as opposed to detrimental,
soil bacteria and fungi. Measurements developed on this project eventually
may complement other commonly used parameters of soil quality. </p>

<p>During the first two years of this project, the researchers developed
extraction and analytical protocols for isolating signature compounds from
soil, and identified one signature compound, the isoflavonoid medicarpin,
in many soil samples. The most striking advance from the third year was
the identification of nucleosides as major soil compounds that are affected
by agronomic management. Elevated amounts of these molecules were found
in manured (vs. unfertilized) treatments in long-term wheat plots at Rothamsted,
England, and in organic (vs. conventional) management treatments in tomato
plots from the USDA-SARE experiment at Davis. Soil extracts prepared from
the USDA-SARE plots containing tomato, bean, and an oat-vetch mixture suggested
that sampling date, rather than crop species, had a greater effect on the
amount of small organic molecules and indicated a new group of potential
signal compounds that deserves future attention in this study. For more

<p>The variegated leafhopper is the most important insect pest in Central
Valley vineyards. This insect causes chlorotic spotting and defoliation
if damage is severe; also, its excretions attract sooty molds, which reduce
photosynthesis and cause table grape bunches to be culled. This project,
now in its third and final year, involves large replicated experiments
which were established in commercial table and raisin grape vineyards.
The researchers are testing the hypothesis that ground covers influence
leafhopper population levels, and, if so, that this is because of higher
predation. They also sought to better determine the role of three groupings
of predators (spiders, predatory flies, and predaceous mites) that are
common in vineyards but have been little studied. Temperatures and humidity
are also being monitored in cover and no-cover treatments to assess the
influence of microclimate on predators. </p>

<p>Although much of the data have not been analyzed, some preliminary observations
can be made. Trends of lower leafhopper numbers in cover-cropped plots
in the table grape vineyard are evident; however, the data do not indicate
any increase in the numbers of beneficial arthropods monitored. There is
little evidence so far that ground covers have more than a minor effect
on vine canopy temperature. For more information, contact: Kent Daane,

<p>This survey was designed to collect information from annual crop growers
that would help focus future research and extension efforts regarding the
use of cover crops in field and vegetable crop systems. UC SAREP funding
was added to this USDA-SARE program funded project, to further target growers
<i>not</i> using cover crops in order to examine barriers. Survey participants
included a random sample of 200 tomato and safflower growers in five counties
(Yolo, Solano, Sutter, San Joaquin and Colusa) plus a targeted list of
48 producers in the same five counties who were thought to be using cover
crops. Participants were asked about their usage of cover crops and their
perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of cover crops. The drawbacks
to cover crops mentioned by cover crop users and non-users were similar:
1) the cover crop could not be incorporated in time for spring planting;
2) a cash crop with a direct economic benefit could be planted instead;
and 3) the overall cost of growing the cover crop was too high (including
seed, labor, equipment, fuel and water costs). Farmers also mentioned increases
in harmful insect populations, and tillage complications due to cover crop
residue. The perceived benefits most often mentioned by farmers not currently
growing cover crops were increases in soil organic matter and the addition
of nitrogen to the soil, benefits that can be obtained through means other
than cover cropping. Many other potential benefits of cover cropping, mentioned
by the cover crop growers, were apparently unknown or unappreciated by
those who did not grow cover crops. These benefits include: increased beneficial
insects, reduced weed problems, increased water holding capacity, increased
nutrient availability to the following crop, and reduced soil compaction.
The greatest research and education needs were identified as: 1) new or
existing cover crop varieties with particular characteristics (e.g. fit
rotation, soil or weather; produce high biomass, fast growth, extensive
root system, or high N content); and 2) the effects of cover crops on various
aspects of the farming system, such as soil structure, fertility, insects
and weeds. For more information, contact: Mark Van Horn, Student Experimental

<p>There is increasing interest in improving the efficiency of nitrogen
use in vegetable crop production in order to decrease contamination of
ground water with nitrate. To this end, there has been a great deal of
research and interest in the use of &quot;quick tests&quot; for nitrate
for plant and soil analysis. In conventional farming systems, monitoring
nitrate using quick tests has proven to be a reliable measure of the crop
nitrogen status and the need for nitrogen fertilizer applications. In organic
farming systems, however, preliminary evidence indicates that nitrate may
not be a good indicator of crop nitrogen status and that the new quick
test technology may not be as applicable. </p>

<p>This study proposes to monitor nitrogen in four farms that are producing
onions: two organic farms that are using compost, cover crops and feather
meal (a slow release fertilizer), and two conventional farms. Soil nitrate
and ammonium will be monitored, as well as nitrate levels in the fresh
sap of root tissue and the total nitrogen in the onion tops. The data will
confirm if quick tests for nitrate are useful on organic farms and will
provide further information on the nitrate levels in soils of organic farms.
Both of these issues may have broad and important implications for nitrogen
leaching and groundwater contamination. For more information, contact:

<p>Many vegetable crop growers in the Salinas Valley are converting to
subsurface drip irrigation because of the benefits that it offers. These
benefits include greater water use efficiency, incremental and steady application
of nitrogen and water, and reduced drainage and nitrate leaching. In addition,
previous research by this investigator has shown that subsurface drip irrigation
reduces corky root and lettuce drop, two serious soilborne diseases. This
project will further confirm the effects of subsurface drip and furrow
irrigations on diseases of lettuce, and will include a grower field day.
Implementation of this irrigation technology would improve the sustainability
of vegetable production systems in the Salinas Valley and contribute to
reduced use of fungicides. For more information, contact: Krishna Subbarao,

<h3>What is Sustainable Agriculture? 
<br>1991 </h3>

<p>This paper identifies ideas, practices, and policies that make up the
broader definition of sustainable agriculture. Animal and plant production
systems and the role of consumers are addressed, and the entire food system
is examined within the context of California's economic, social, and political
environments. 6 pages. SAREP authors <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>, Chuck Ingels and David
Campbell. Free. </p>

<h3>How to Stabilize Your Farm Work Force (and Increase Profits, Productivity,
and Personal Satisfaction) 
<br>Publication SA-004, 1995 </h3>

<p>This UC SAREP-funded handbook shows farmers how to diversify their operations
to keep employees busy throughout the year. It brings together the strategies,
benefits and challenges encountered by farmers who keep workers employed
year-round. Interviews were conducted with 35 California farmers who shared
some of the underlying principles that make their systems work, including
crop diversification and rotation, staggered planting, saving work for
off-season, labor sharing with other farmers and selective mechanization.
Although no easy formula for year-round cropping systems can be given,
details and charts are included for three farms from different areas of
California. Written by a team of UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors
and independent agricultural economists. 44 pages. Authors: Suzanne Vaupel,
Gary Johnston, Franz Kegel, Gregory Billikopf, and Melissa Cadet. Cost:
$6. </p>

<h3>A Guide to Spanish Language Sustainable Agriculture Publications 
<br>Publication SA-003, 1995 </h3>

<p>This UC SAREP-funded publication is a collection of English abstracts
of 74 Spanish-language documents about sustainable farming practices for

<p>In early 1995 SAREP launched a World Wide Web server on the Internet
(URL=<a href="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/">http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/</a>)
which allows users to view program information from locations all over
the world. Currently the SAREP Web pages include program publications,
summaries of grants previously funded, requests for proposals for the SAREP
and Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) grants programs, a calendar
of events, and computer applications. Information is provided on topics
such as cover crops as a production option for soil improvement, attracting
barn owls as a possible component in rodent population controls, and a
comparison of bovine growth hormone with rotational grazing. Consumer and
policy issues are addressed as well, covering topics such as direct marketing,
community supported agriculture, and agricultural land preservation. When
complete, the SAREP Web pages will comprise an outstanding database of
scientific, technical and practical information, including over 300 newsletter
articles from seven years of SAREP's quarterly newsletters, and more than
100 summaries of research and education projects funded by SAREP. </p>

<p>In addition to its own information, SAREP's Web pages provide a home
for, and links to, other bodies of closely related information. For example,
our Web server includes pages from the California Energy Commission's Agricultural
Energy Assistance Program (AEAP), whose publications on energy management,
pest management, and irrigation management are searchable along with SAREP's
own, providing the public with &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for information
from the two programs. SAREP's Web page also links to other Internet sites
that feature sustainable agriculture information, such as the National
Agricultural Library's Alternative Farming Systems Information Center,
the Western Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)
program, the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN), and sites that maintain
comprehesive indexes of agricultural information such as the University
of Florida's AgriGator. In addition, many of SAREP's staff are active participants
in SAN's electronic mail group, SANET-MG, and other Internet discussion
groups. </p>

<h2 align=center>Other Staff Activities </h2>

<h3>BIOS </h3>

<p>Three years ago, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the Pew Charitable
Trust, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cooperatively provided
funding for the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF) Foundation
to undertake a project called the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS). This project enables almond growers in Merced and Stanislaus counties
to learn about biologically based farming while reducing reliance on synthetic
pesticides and fertilizers. The almond BIOS program involves a group of
30 to 50 participating farmers and a team of educators, including mentor
farmers experienced in biologically integrated methods, private agricultural
consultants, and University of California scientists and farm advisors.
All participating farmers are provided with a package of technical and
financial assistance. The BIOS approach thus represents an intensification
of traditional extension techniques. The almond BIOS project emphasizes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Biological and cultural control of pests; </li>

<li>On-farm habitats for beneficial insects, mites, and spiders; </li>

<li>A strong emphasis on soil-building practices, often including biological
nitrogen fixation to supply all or part of the nitrogen needed by crop
plants; and </li>

<li>Reduced reliance on agricultural chemicals. </li>
</ul>

<p>SAREP's <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> and Chuck Ingels serve as management team members
on Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) projects. In BIOS, growers
and their pest control advisors work closely with the management team to
implement practices which reduce their use of pesticides and/or synthetic
fertilizers. The almond BIOS project is currently underway in Merced and
Stanislaus counties (20 to 30 growers each), while a walnut BIOS project
is operating in Yolo and Solano counties (18 growers). Bugg is on the management
team of both the almond BIOS project and the walnut BIOS project; Ingels
is on the management team of the walnut BIOS project. Early returns from
BIOS have been impressive, with high rates of farmer participation and
adoption of the biologically integrated approach. The BIOS projects provide
the model upon which the new Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS)
initiative is based (See BIFS section for more information, p. 56). </p>

<h3>ATTRACTING BARN OWLS TO FARMS </h3>

<p>SAREP's Chuck Ingels has gathered and developed information on attracting
barn owls to farms. The barn owl is often called the most beneficial bird
in the world because its diet consists primarily of voles, gophers, mice,
and rats. Each adult barn owl may consume about one or two rodents per
night; some studies show that a nesting pair and their offspring may eat
more than 1,000 rodents per year. Although no research has yet been conducted
in California to show an effect on rodent abundance by installing nest
boxes on farms, some growers report substantial reductions in gophers.
In order to increase our understanding of barn owls, Ingels will be working
with other UC researchers on two projects: 1) an experiment to evaluate
the effects of installing nest boxes on gopher abundance; and 2) a survey
of farmers who have built nest boxes. The goal of the survey is to gather
information on the structures farmers have built, trends in nest box occupancy
by barn owls, and the perceived effects of installing nest boxes on rodent
pest problems. </p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE </h3>

<p>SAREP's <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> is serving on the steering committee of the California
Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (CASA). CASA is a coalition of university
programs and non-profit community organizations funded by a three-year,
$2 million dollar grant from the Kellogg Foundation. It is the largest
of the 18 Integrated Farming Systems projects Kellogg has funded across
the United States. Joining SAREP in the collaboration are the Bio-Integral
Resource Center, the California Adolescent Nutrition and Fitness Program,
the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems of UC Santa Cruz,
the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, the Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape
Commission, the Rural Development Center, and the Sustainable Cotton Project.
CASA's collaborative projects include a database on agricultural sustainability,
a series of workshops on sustainable alternatives to methyl bromide, a
media outreach effort to educate the public about sustainable agriculture,
outreach to farmworkers in the Salinas Valley, and start-up support for
the California Sustainable Agriculture Working Group. Other CASA activities
include creating guides for reducing farm chemical use, introducing IPM
practices to winegrape and tomato growers, a leadership training program,
and a community planning process in Santa Cruz County for sustaining agriculture
in the face of environmental threats and urban development. </p>

<p>Campbell's work for the coalition is focused on developing a working
paper to identify concrete strategies for implementing sustainable agriculture
in ways that enhance local and regional economic and social development.
During Year One of the Kellogg grant, a background paper presenting a rationale
for sustainable agriculture as an economic development strategy was prepared.
During Year Two, consultations with community food systems groups and presentations
at sustainable agriculture meetings were made to disseminate these ideas,
and case study material from a variety of California locations was collected.
Recent developments, including local marketing campaigns in Sonoma, Placer,
and Humboldt counties, indicate a renewed interest in fostering positive
links between agriculture and communities and present a ripe opportunity
for comparative analysis and information sharing. During Year Three of
the grant, the earlier working paper was revised through the development
of in-depth case studies. This revised paper was presented at the October
1995 &quot;Politics of Sustainable Agriculture&quot; conference in Eugene,
Oregon. Campbell will continue to work directly with grass roots community
groups in California to develop and evaluate community food systems projects
which enhance local economic development. Already, working relationships
have been established with representatives of Sonoma Select, Humboldt Harvest,
and PlacerGROWN. </p>

<p>Campbell also produced a fact sheet highlighting key trends and contradictions
in California agriculture. The fact sheet addresses a diverse range of
issues, including agricultural productivity, pesticide use, farm concentration,
hunger and poverty, labor wages and conditions, farmland conversion, water
issues, organic production, and farmers' markets. The fact sheet was distributed
at the February 1995 networking meeting of the Kellogg IFS initiative to
a national audience of leaders in sustainable agriculture. </p>

<h3>DEVELOPING COMMUNITY FOOD SYSTEMS </h3>

<p>SAREP analysts <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> are engaged in research
and outreach activities designed to promote development of community food
systems. These systems integrate ecologically sound distribution and consumption
patterns with sustainable production to enhance the economic and social
life of particular regions. Among the activities to date are: creation
of a new section in SAREP's Request for Proposals on community food systems,
development of an extensive bibliography, preparation of a flyer on &quot;Ten
Things You Can Do To Develop a Community Food System,&quot; developing
links between farmers and agencies that use the Alameda County Community
Food Bank, and consultation with county advisors and community groups interested
in starting local food system projects in their cities, counties, or regions.
Feenstra has written a review of local food systems in the United States
with a critical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses, and identified
strategies that might be most effective in developing additional community
food systems. This paper was presented at the October 1995 &quot;Politics
of Sustainable Agriculture&quot; conference in Eugene, Oregon. </p>

<h3>LINKING LOCAL FARMERS WITH SCHOOL FOOD SERVICES </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> has been collaborating with the UC Small Farm Center,
the California Alliance with Family Farmers, the California Federation
of Certified Farmers' Markets and the California Association of School
Business Officials to facilitate partnerships between local farmers and
school food service buyers. A presentation (and pamphlet) titled &quot;How
to Buy from Local Farmers&quot; was given at the statewide meeting of school
food service directors in April 1995. A research project that would conduct
case studies of participating and nonparticipating school districts and
several pilot projects is now being developed. Information from the case
studies and experiences from the pilot projects will be the basis of a
guide for school food service buyers and farmers about how such partnerships
might successfully be formed. It will also include local contacts by crop
and region. The guide will be disseminated widely through Cooperative Extension
and the California Department of Education. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS CONCEPTS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CLASS </h3>

<p>For several years, <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> have created assignments
and course curricula related to agricultural sustainability, regional food
systems, and community economic development for government classes at UC
Davis. Students in the classes have done field research projects to identify
the possibilities of substituting locally grown foods for imported foods
into the greater Davis community food system, and the university campus
food service. </p>

<h3>COVER CROPS WORKGROUP </h3>

<p>Chuck Ingels organized and now chairs the UC Cover Crops Workgroup.
The workgroup has nearly 100 members, mostly UC personnel. The purpose
of the workgroup is to provide a forum for Cooperative Extension farm advisors
and specialists, UC faculty, and others to share information, determine
the highest priority research and extension needs, and to coordinate activities
to fulfill these needs. Two meetings have been held, at which researchers
presented results of cover crop-related experiments. Abstracts of these
projects are available from Ingels either by mail ($5.00, checks payable
to UC Regents) or e-mail (free; caingels@ucdavis.edu). </p>

<h3>COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC ISSUES WORKGROUP </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> is participating in DANR's Community Development and
Public Issues (CDPI) Workgroup. The workgroup was recently formed from
the merger of the Community Development and Public Policy workgroups. Its
members are working to promote DANR's effective involvement in policy issues
and in partnerships with California communities. At a May 1995 CDPI-sponsored
workshop Campbell presented a matrix for comparative analysis of &quot;community
interventions&quot; by DANR personnel. The matrix and analysis will be
available in a forthcoming proceedings of the conference to be published
by DANR. He is also on the planning committee for a CDPI workshop which
will train county advisors in effective methods for becoming involved in
public issues.</p>

<h3>WESTERN REGION SARE </h3>

<p>UC SAREP carries out several activities with support from its national
counterpart, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sustainable Agriculture
Research and Education (SARE) program, which is managed for the western
states by the Western Region SARE program located at Utah State University.
In June of 1994, UC SAREP Associate Director <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A> was selected
via a competitive process to coordinate the Western SARE Consortium/Network
for implementation of the Professional Development/In-Service Education
program for Cooperative Extension, Natural Resource Conservation Service,
and other agricultural professionals. The program is a coordinated effort
of competitive grants and state-level strategic planning and implementation
grants in the 13 western states and four Pacific Island affiliates in the
region. </p>

<p>UC SAREP also houses the Western SARE Communications Specialist, Kristen
Kelleher, who provides public information and outreach for the entire Western
SARE program of research and education grants, Agriculture in Concert with
the Environment grants (a partnership between USDA and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency), and the SARE Farmer/Rancher Research Grants. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE NETWORK </h3>

<p><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A> continues to serve on the Executive Committee of the
national Sustainable Agriculture Network, a USDA SARE-funded effort of
information exchange which she helped to develop as chair of the SAN Committee
from its inception through 1993. SAN provides information in printed publications
and electronic databases (on diskette and on the Internet) and sponsors
an Internet electronic mail discussion group, SANET-MG, with more than
700 participants. </p>

<h3>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION EDUCATION PROGRAM </h3>

<p>SAREP analysts <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> and Chuck Ingels are participating as mentors
in the Agricultural Production and Education Program, which was started
by Winters walnut grower Craig McNamara. This is a pilot program designed
to offer high school students firsthand experience in sustainable agriculture
and on-farm research. The program, which began in 1994, is being coordinated
by Sandy Creighton and Mark Linder of the California Foundation for Agriculture
in the Classroom. In the first year, it involved six students from each
of four high schools from Northern California. Students worked on projects
with the assistance of four UC Davis mentors, including Mike Singer, soil
scientist in the UCD land, air and water resources department, Frank Zalom,
director of the Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project, and Bugg
and Ingels. Students participated in walnut harvest, planted cover crops,
attached cardboard bands to trees for codling moth control, and built and
installed barn owl boxes. Students also conducted research projects and
toured UCD research facilities. In 1995, the project expanded to two additional
schools. The program is being evaluated and promoted by Linda Whent, lecturer
in the agronomy and range science department. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN SPANISH </h3>

<p>Spanish language materials about sustainable agriculture farming practices
are now available at five California sites:the UC Davis Small Farm Center,
the Rural Development Center in Salinas, the UC Cooperative Extension offices
in Fresno and San Diego, and at the Center for Chicano Studies at UC Santa
Barbara. Seventy-four Spanish documents at each site describe practical
information about alternative agriculture practices appropriate for small-scale,
entry-level Hispanic farmers, farm advisors or others who work with this
population. All of these documents have been summarized in English and
appear in A Guide to Spanish Language Sustainable Agriculture Publications
(see Publications section, p. 44). </p>

<h3>MEDIA OUTREACH </h3>

<p>In addition to direct outreach via meetings, workshops or program publications,
SAREP gets information to farmers, researchers, agricultural professionals,
policy makers and consumers through the popular press (newspapers, magazines,
radio and television), the agricultural trade press, professional journals
and postings to the Internet. Press releases about research projects, specific
farming practices, workshops, symposia and other program activities sent
out via mail, electronic mail and Internet discussion group postings have
prompted numerous print and broadcast news stories in California, the nation
and the world. </p>

<p>Between July 1993 and July 1995 articles have appeared in the Los Angeles
Times, the Washington Post, the Hokkaido Shimbun Press (Sapporo, Japan),
the Chicago Tribune, the Sacramento Bee, the San Francisco Examiner, the
Topeka Kansas Capital-Journal, the San Francisco Bay-Guardian, Organic
Gardening, Sunset Magazine, Business Week, and numerous smaller state and
local newspapers and magazines. Other major media contacts resulting in
stories have been made with CNN, the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, National
Public Radio (Morning Edition and Living on Earth), 48 Hours/CBS; KGO-TV
San Francisco; KRON-TV San Francisco; KCRA-TV Sacramento; KPFA-Radio Berkeley;
KMJ-Radio Fresno; WILL-Radio Urbana, IL; WIBW-Radio Topeka, KS. Additionally,
articles have appeared in wire service feeds from the Associated Press,
Copley News Service, McClatchy News Service and the Bay City News Service.
</p>

<p>Agricultural trade publications and professional journals that have
carried stories about SAREP activities in the last two years include AGWEEK,
New Farm, California Farmer, California-Arizona Farm Press, Ag Alert, The
Packer, Dairyman Magazine, The Cheese Reporter, American Journal of Alternative
Agriculture, HortScience and many others. </p>

<p>Additionally, SAREP has made use of PROFNET, an Internet electronic
mail discussion group for the news media and university professionals.
Through PROFNET, the program has been able to reach news outlets throughout
the world with information about SAREP activities and individual experts.
There have been numerous other Internet postings in the last year to scientific
and agricultural interest groups throughout the world. For example, postings
have been made about SAREP publications and research to SANET-MG, a 700-member
sustainable agriculture electronic mail discussion group, which have resulted
in articles in sustainable agriculture publications. </p>

<h3>LINKS TO OTHER PROGRAMS THROUGH ADVISORY BOARDS </h3>

<p>SAREP Director <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A> and Associate Director <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>
have served on the advisory boards and advisory committees of numerous
sustainable agriculture organizations and government agencies including
the California Department of Food and Agriculture's Pest Management Advisory
Committee and Fertilizer Research and Education Program, the Organic Farming
Research Foundation, the Henry A. Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture,
and the World Sustainable Agriculture Association. <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A> serves
on the boards of the statewide California Sustainable Agriculture Working
Group, the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture and
the Agriculture, Food and Human Values Society. </p>

<h3>EDUCATION FOR EXTENSION PROFESSIONALS </h3>

<p>A new USDA program for professional education in sustainable agriculture
was initiated in 1994. Funding was made available under the 1990 Farm Bill
(Title XVI, Subtitle B, Chapter 3) for each state to develop a statewide
strategic plan for professional development, targeting Cooperative Extension
(CE) advisors, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) field staff,
and other agricultural consultants. SAREP coordinated this activity in
California. </p>

<p>Our planning process centered around three focus groups, which were
held in November and December of 1994 in Merced, Riverside and Davis. The
purposes of these meetings were to better define the educational needs
and interests of the target </p>

<h2>Activities </h2>

<p>audiences, and identify the methods and strategies that would be most
successful in meeting those needs. More than 60 individuals participated
in the focus groups including CE advisors and county directors from each
of its four regions, NRCS field staff, farmers, and representatives of
several UC programs and non-profit organizations involved in sustainable
agriculture education. </p>

<p>Since the target audiences for the Chapter 3 program are initially CE
and the NRCS, the participation of advisors and field staff from these
organizations was especially important. The plan builds on the considerable
expertise and ongoing work of California's CE and NRCS personnel in extending
information about sustainable agriculture, and aims to enhance their work
with farms, ranches and communities across the state. </p>

<p>Much of the discussion that took place during the planning meetings
focused on enriching the educational efforts that are already underway
and strengthening the programs of the many organizations and groups in
California involved in sustainable agriculture education. In summary, the
planning groups recommended a three-part approach that: </p>

<ul>
<li>builds on existing educational programs; </li>

<li>provides focused programs and farm tours on high priority topics and
issues; and </li>

<li>strengthens extension teams and networks addressing related problems
and issues. </li>
</ul>

<p>These components and the assessment of educational needs and interests
of the target audiences are described in detail in the planning document
which is available from SAREP. </p>

<h2 align=center>LONG-TERM<a name="LONG-TERM"></a> RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURAL
SYSTEMS </h2>

<p>In addition to funding competitive research grants and distributing
information, the UC 
<br>Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program is charged by
the California Legislature to answer questions about the long-term effects
of agricultural practices. Most of the chemical, biological and physical
processes that define the sustainability and environmental impacts of agricultural
practices occur over long time periods ranging from ten to 100 years. Many
scientists agree that the answers to the questions about long-term impacts
can only be obtained through extended field experiments. Long-term farmland
research sites are field laboratories for on-going studies of fundamental
processes and mechanisms that influence the sustainability of agricultural
systems. While the emphasis of long-term studies is on research and data
collection over a long period, information can be gathered and distributed
continuously. 
<br>
<br>In fiscal year 1989/90, SAREP provided $150,000 to a project entitled,
&quot;Long-term Research on Agricultural Systems: Crop Diversity and Input
Level as Determinants of Function and Evolution of the Agroecosystem&quot;
(LTRAS), involving a team of 18 researchers at UC Davis. This one-time
award was given to help establish the first long-term research facility
in irrigated agriculture in a Mediterranean climate anywhere in the world.
LTRAS is located on 300 acres in Yolo County and is directed by R. Ford
Denison, agronomy and range science deparment, UC Davis. LTRAS represents
a major commitment of University of California partners to the sustainability
of California agriculture. The LTRAS project addresses questions about
the appropriate level and nature of inputs to define a sustainable agricultural
system that meets our requirement for food and for the environment. The
UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences committed almost
$550,000 in matching resources to this site from 1990-1993, and $155,000
for FY 1993/94. The project continues to receive major support from the
college. It also recently received a $275,000 National Research Initiative
(NRI) grant from USDA. </p>

<p>The first experiment on the site, which was started in late 1993, is
a 60-acre comparison of annual cropping systems that include rotations
with wheat, corn, tomatoes, and winter legume cover crops. Initially, the
experiment included ten cropping systems that differ in reliance on external
inputs of irrigation water and nitrogen, and included a two-year organic
corn/tomato rotation. Long-term trends in key soil properties, such as
organic matter, weed seeds, pH, and salinity, are being monitored. Resulting
differences in yield, resource use efficiency, profitability, and environmental
impact (such as leaching of nitrate or pesticides) will be used to evaluate
the sustainability of these cropping systems. LTRAS is expected to make
important contributions to agricultural science within a few years, as
well as over the long-term. In FY 1993/94, SAREP paid for pest management
consulting services provided by Kerry Beane, an expert in IPM and organic
methods. In FY 1994/95, SAREP awarded $10,000 to Denison to establish a
new four-year organic rotation (s<i>ee Sustainable Agricultural Production
Grants, p. 36) .</i> </p>

<h2 align=center>BIOLOGICALLY<a name="BIOLOGICALLY"></a> INTEGRATED FARMING
SYSTEMS (BIFS) 
<br>Field Crops Row Crops Orchards Vineyards </h2>

<p>Results from successful Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
projects inspired 
<br>new enabling legislation (Assembly Bill 3383), which was passed unanimously
by both houses of the California legislature and signed into law by Governor
Pete Wilson in late 1994. Under AB 3383, UC SAREP awards grants through
a competitive process for pilot demonstration projects to help farmers
learn about &quot;biologically integrated farming systems&quot; (BIFS).
Projects were proposed for wine grapes, cotton, various field and vegetable
crops, citrus, and pears. Proposals were evaluated by the Program Advisory
Review Board, as designated in AB 3383. 
<br></p>

<p>The California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency have provided funding of $670,000 for projects to begin
in FY 1995/1996 and beyond. Additional funding will be needed to fully
fund the five pilot projects that are specified in the legislation. 
<br></p>

<p>In early August 1995, the first two projects were funded and are described
below. These projects are not covered in the financial report. We will
be reporting on these and other BIFS projects in future progress reports.

<p>This participatory extension and research project is designed to facilitate
information exchange among farmers, consultants and researchers on biologically
integrated farming practices within the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley
(SJV). It is modeled on the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS)
projects, which have been developed primarily for a single, permanent crop.
In this project, participating farmer, university and private and public
agency members have embraced the BIOS spirit, but modified the approach
to best match the rotational cropping patterns of Central Valley row crop
farmers. The project will monitor and evaluate on-farm demonstrations of
soil-building practices and options for reduced reliance on agrichemicals,
determine the extent to which integrated pest management practices are
used in row crops on the West Side, and identify problems preventing further
adoption. It will provide community demonstrations of technologies while
making use of participatory research teams to develop and refine additional
information. The project will provide technical assistance to farmers and
their consultants, and intensive pest management monitoring of fields enrolled
in the project. Side-by-side comparisons between conventionally managed
and biologically-based production systems will be established on the 13
cooperator farms. In each of the biologically integrated parcels, cover
crops and composted organic materials will be integrated into rotations
wherever appropriate, while in the conventionally managed parcels, mineral
fertilizer applications will be made. A common West Side crop rotation
of tomatoes/cotton/onions-garlic will be followed at most sites. Pest management
practices will be evaluated and alternatives will be developed through
a participatory process. On-farm pest management demonstrations, hands-on
training, and field workshops will provide invaluable links with work groups
and task forces. While this program focuses primarily on annual cropping
systems of the Huron/Five Points area, the findings and results of these
activities will be applicable to the entire western side of the SJV which
is 200 miles long and 20 miles wide and extends from Los Banos to Bakersfield.

Department of Entomological Sciences, UC Berkeley</i> </p>

<p>Grapes are the leading economic crop grown in California, with a total
value of over $1.6 billion (CDFA, 1994). In 1988 more than 1 million pounds
of insecticides and one-quarter million pounds of miticides were applied
to vineyards to control pests. The Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission
includes 650 growers on 46,000 acres of vineyards. The BIFS wine grape
project is based on biologically integrated farming methods that the Commission
began developing in 1992 to reduce chemical pesticide use, promote effective
and rapid adoption of sustainable wine grape production practices, and
promote economic development in San Joaquin County by cultivating a market
niche for wine grapes produced with more environmentally sensitive practices.
Prototype vineyards have dramatically reduced the use of pesticides and
synthetic fertilizers while maintaining crop yield and quality through
the use of cover crops and composts, weed management using more environmentally
sensitive cultural practices, careful monitoring of mite and insect populations,
mite management through release of mite predators, encouraging natural
enemies by establishing refuges, and the conversion of some vineyards to
drip irrigation. With the cooperation of district growers the Commission
is implementing BIFS on 30 vineyards comprising 1,921 acres. To ensure
the success of the program the commission has assembled cooperators and
a management team made up of the Statewide IPM Project director, a University
of California scientist pivotal in the development of IPM, a University
of California Cooperative Extension viticulture farm advisor, consultants
experienced in implementing BIFS technologies, pest control advisors, and
growers. Participating farms were evaluated by the BIFS team at the onset
of the project and will be monitored seasonally. The Commission is conducting
ongoing side-by-side comparisons of yields and pesticide use between the
BIFS-farmed blocks and conventionally farmed blocks on the farms of cooperating
growers. The results of the comparisons will be made available with other
project data at monthly grower meetings, field days, smaller neighborhood
grower meetings, seminars, and in monthly newsletters.</p>
