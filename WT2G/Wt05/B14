<i>A Legacy of Service to Indiana</i><p>

<p>

<p>

The Office of the Indiana State Chemist was created in 1881 by the General Assembly which was
engaged in the task of passing legislation to regulate the sale and distribution of fertilizer in the state.
Enforcement of this law required the facilities and expertise of an analytical chemist who could
determine whether or not a fertilizer product was in accordance with its description as found upon the
product label.  Dr. Harvey Wiley was the Professor of Agricultural Chemistry at Purdue University at
that time.  He was designated the first State Chemist of Indiana.  His interest in the use of analytical
chemistry in the enforcement of product regulatory laws took him to Washington, D.C. as head of the
Bureau of Chemistry of the USDA.  He was a strong advocate for the formation of an agency to regulate
food and drugs.  Upon its formation in 1906 he was the first Director of the Federal Food and Drug
Administration.<p>

<p>

In subsequent years the Office of the State Chemist has been directly or indirectly given the
responsibility for administering and enforcing four other  state laws having to do with truth-in-labeling
of products used primarily by production agriculture, but to some degree also by urban society.  These
are<p>

<p>

1) Indiana Seed Law<p>

2) Legume Inoculant/Plant Growth Substances Law<p>

3) Indiana Commercial Feed Law<p>

4) Indiana Pesticide Registration Law<p>

<p>

These laws are designed to allow open and equitable competition in the marketplace, and elimination
of consumer fraud.  They establish the following objectives for the products to which they relate:<p>

<p>

1) Determining responsibility for products entered into the state's commerce<p>

2) Establishing legal descriptions for products, in terms of identity, purity, and concentration of each
ingredient<p>

3) Requiring stated or inferred claims of efficacy, quality, or usefulness be made for the product by the
producer or vendor, and<p>

4) Requiring what type of information be stated on an approved label or tag accompanying the product.<p>

<p>

To achieve its goals, the office analyzes thousands of samples of seeds, fertilizers, feeds and crop
protection and other chemicals to assure compliance with truth-in-labeling and other laws and
regulations.<p>

<p>

<b>Additional Responsibilities &amp; Duties<p>

</b><p>

In 1965 the passage of the Agricultural Ammonia Law put a very different charge within the care of the
State Chemist.  This new charge was not concerned with fraud but with safety.  Anhydrous ammonia
is a corrosive substance whose potential hazards are magnified by the required manner of storing and
handling it under high pressure.  It was recognized that the location of retail facilities to store and
dispense the product should be selected with potential hazards in mind and that the design and
maintenance of the equipment should meet certain standards.  The State Chemist was charged with
producing and enforcing rules to achieve these objectives.<p>

<p>

The seventh law added by the legislature to the responsibilities of the State Chemist was passed in
response to action of the federal congress.  That body had been persuaded that federal and state
product laws relating to pesticide chemicals were inadequate to curtail the continuing contamination
of land, air and water without an effort to improve the understanding and behavioral competence of the
applicators of those products.  This new responsibility required developing programs to train, if
necessary, examine and certify potential pesticide applicators involved in applying such products.  The
Indiana Pesticide Use and Application Law was passed in 1975 and the State Chemist was designated
to prepare and administer the required examinations and to issue the appropriate licenses and permits.<p>

<p>

An eighth law was added in 1988 and established the Indiana Seed Arbitration Council to provide
arbitration of disputes concerning agricultural and vegetable seeds sold in the state.  The law
established the Arbitration Council which consists of representatives of the Indiana Seed Trade, the
Director of Extension at Purdue, the Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station, a representative
of an Indiana farmer organization, and the Seed Commissioner.<p>

<p>

<b>Facilities and Staff<p>

<p>

</b>When the Office of the State Chemist was originally established in 1881, it had only one employee -
Professor Wiley.  He was the only agricultural chemistry professor at Purdue at the time.  <p>

Today the office has a staff of 67 administrators, investigators, inspectors,  laboratory technicians and
support staff who are headed by Alan R. Hanks, State Chemist and Seed Commissioner.  The staff
includes an associate state chemist who is laboratory director, and seed, fertilizer, pesticide and animal
feeds administrators in charge of each section.  The personnel of the staff are employed and
administered under the policies and practices followed by the University for clerical, technical,
professional staff and faculty.<p>

<p>

The operations are located on the Purdue University campus, occupying portions of the Biochemistry
Building on the South Campus.  Most of the offices occupy a wing constructed in 1977 using funds
derived from revenues of State Chemist regulatory programs.  <p>

<p>

<b>Operational Funding<p>

</b><p>

The Office of the State Chemist and Seed Commissioner operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million.
Most of the budget is generated by inspection, product registration, and licensing fees.  About $500,000
is paid by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency for enforcing
federal laws including the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act.  The Office of the State
Chemist and Seed Commissioner receives no direct appropriation from the state.  The self-supporting
structure of the programs plus the physical separation from the seat of state government has provided
an environment in which science and reason can be emphasized.<p>

<p>

<b>Animal Feeds<p>

</b><p>

The regulation of animal feeds in Indiana includes the oversight of a broad spectrum of animal feeds
that includes not only commercial livestock feeds and basic feed ingredients, but also dogs, cats,
specialty pets like hamsters, tropical fish, caged song birds, horses, rabbits, and wild birds, to name
a few.<p>

<p>

The basic tools used include: (1) licensing of both in-state and out-of-state firms distributing
commercial feeds in or into Indiana, (2) making sure that products are properly labeled to give all the
necessary information to effectively and safely use the feed products, (3) making sure that feeds are
being manufactured using good manufacturing practices, (4) sampling and analysis of feeds being
distributed to make sure they meet the claims for the products made in their labeling, and (5) applying
appropriate regulatory actions when products are found to be misbranded or adultrated.<p>

<p>

These tasks are accomplished by a vigorous and comprehensive good manufacturing practices
inspection program supported by sampling and analysis of product samples collected based upon
inspectional findings.<p>

<p>

<b>Fertilizers<p>

<p>

</b>Fertilizer materials regulated by the Indiana Fertilizer Law include all products making claims of
providing plant nutrients to enhance and improve plant growth. This includes all recognized sources
of agricultural fertilizers as well as lawn and garden products designed for the homeowner.<p>

<p>

Each grade and brand of fertilizer must be registered with tags or package labels correctly identifying
ingredients as to quantity.  Registration and sale of a product can be denied if there are ingredients for
which there is no basis for plant nutrient claims, or substances which are not sufficiently well-defined
to be subject to analytical confirmation in State Chemist laboratories.<p>

<p>

<b>Pesticides<p>

<p>

</b>Much of the authority for enforcement of pesticide laws rests with the federal government, but under
state law the State Chemist can deny registration and sales of pesticides when claims for quality and
efficacy do not match.  The State Chemist operates under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. EPA
to administer the federal pesticide laws in Indiana.<p>

<p>

Considerable effort is expended by State Chemist staff responding to consumer complaints regarding
safe and effective pesticide use.  Misuse and/or misapplication of termite control products and non-target drift damage from agricultural applications are leading causes for complaints from consumers.

An additional responsibility of the State Chemist is certification and licensing pesticide applicators to
help assure environmental and human protection from potential harm that may be caused by illegal use
of a pesticide.<p>

<p>

<b>Seeds<p>

<p>

</b>The Indiana Seed Law regulates both agricultural and vegetable seeds sold in the state.  Agricultural
seeds are those of legumes, grasses, forages, cereal, and fiber crops.  Included in this category are
lawn and turf seeds.<p>

<p>

Vegetable seeds are those of crops grown commercially and in home gardens and commonly known
as vegetables.  Seeds grown strictly for their ornamental value (flower seeds, for example) are not
included.<p>

<p>

The law requires all seeds to be labeled truthfully regarding their identification, purity, and viability.
Basic quality information relating to germination and weed seed contamination are required to provide
the purchaser important information to make intelligent purchases.  The law also classifies certain
weed seeds as "noxious weeds" and restricts their presence in seed offered for seeding purposes.<p>

<p>

The Office of the Seed Commissioner also operates under a cooperative agreement with the USDA
Seed Regulatory and Testing Branch to enforce the Federal Seed Act on cases involving interstate seed
shipments made into Indiana.  Violations are documented and samples are collected and forwarded
to USDA for appropriate federal action.<p>

<b><p>

Inoculants and Plant Growth Substances<p>

</b>This law attempts to regulate those types of products developed to promote or enhance plant growth.
These  products usually claim or involve the active "biological" ingredients that either take the place
of traditional fertilizers or improve soil structure and utilization of plant nutrients by the species
targeted.  Registration of products is required on an annual basis and the registrant is required to
submit efficacy data to support label claims made.  <p>

this act or of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, he or his authorized agent or
agents may issue an order to the owner, the owner's agent, or operator of the facility or
equipment involved to correct such violation immediately: Provided, however, that the state
chemist or his agent or agents shall grant a request for a reasonable extension of time where
there is practical difficulty in complying with the order, and where the time extension will not
cause a safety hazard to the public, including persons who use the facility or equipment.  Any
such order issued shall be in writing.<p>

<p>

15-3-2-10			Rules and regulations, uniform force and effect; municipal zoning regulations
and building codes<p>

<p>

	Sec. 10.  The rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this act shall have

act.<p>

<p>

15-3-2-12	Application of act; nonconforming installations<p>

<p>

	Sec. 12.  Except as herein provided this act shall apply to all installations made after
the effective date of the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder.  Existing installations
which do not comply fully with the requirements of the rules and regulations promulgated
hereunder shall be allowed to continue in service unless it is determined by the state chemist
that the installation or condition presents a distinct safety hazard to the public, including

<p>

15-3-2-13	Violations; prosecution; injunction<p>

<p>

	Sec. 13. (a) A person who violates this chapter commits a Class C infraction.  The
prosecuting attorney of any judicial circuit in which a violation has occurred and to whom any
violation has been reported by the state chemist shall institute the appropriate proceedings
and prosecute the same in a court.  Before the state chemist reports a violation for
prosecution, an opportunity shall be given the person to present his views.  The state chemist
need not report for prosecution minor violations of this chapter whenever he believes that the
public interest is best served by other action.<p>

	(b) The state chemist may apply for a temporary or permanent injunction restraining
any person from violating or continuing to violate this chapter or any rule or regulation
promulgated under this chapter, notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law.  The
injunction shall be issued without bond.<p>

misrepresentation and is correct with the advice of the director of the Purdue
University Agricultural Experiment Station.  When any such additional plant foods are
claimed, they shall be included in the guarantee in the form of the element, and shall
be subject to inspection and analysis in accordance with the methods that may be
prescribed by the state chemist.<p>

"Surface Area = Total Outside Surface Area of container in square feet.  When the surface area is not stamped on the name plate  or
when the marking is not legible the area can be calculated by using one of the following formulas:<p>

<p>

	(1) Cylindrical container with hemispherical heads<p>

<p>

		Area = overall length in feet times outside diameter in feet times 3.1416<p>

<p>

	(2) Cylindrical container with other than hemispherical heads<p>

<p>

				Area = (overall length in feet plus 0.3 outside diameter in feet) times outside diameter in feet times 3.1416.<p>

<p>

	(3) Spherical container<p>

<p>

		Area = outside diameter in feet squared times 3.1416<p>

<p>

"Flow Rate - CFM Air = Cubic feet per minute of air required at standard conditions, 60oF and atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia)."  "The
rate of discharge may be interpolated for intermediate values of surface area.  For containers with total outside surface area greater than
2,500 sq. ft., the required flow rate can be calculated using the formula, Flow Rate CFM Air = 22.11 ao.82 where A = outside surface area
of the container in square feet."<p>

<H2>What We Do</H2>


<P>Our laboratory collects and analyzes approximately 3000 official samples
per year.  These samples are examined for over 80 different analytes.
Labeling is reviewed both in the field and through administrative levels to
make sure that all feed sold in this state is labeled properly.</P>
<P>The program relies heavily on inspections designed to assure that manufacturers
are using Good Manufacturing Practices in making feeds.</P>
<H2>Indiana Commercial Feed Law  IC-15-5-3 (Amended 1991)</H2>
<P>The feed law regulates the labeing and distribution of most animal feeds in Indiana
Feeds must be truthfully labeling and free of harmful or deletrious substances.  The law
is dedicated to food safety as well as providing feeds that are accurately and adequately labeled.</P>

National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences for such
limited or qualified purpose; or<p>

		(b)	The pet food product contains a combination of ingredients which when
fed for such limited purpose will satisfy the nutrient requirements for such
limited purpose and has had its capabilities in this regard demonstrated by
adequate testing.<p>

<p>

REGULATION PF3.	BRAND AND PRODUCT NAMES<p>

<p>

  (a)	No flavor designation shall be used on a pet food label unless the designated flavor is
detectable by a recognized test method, or is one the presence of which provides a
characteristic distinguishable by the pet.  Any flavor designation on a pet food label
must either conform to the name of its source as shown in the ingredient statement or
the ingredient statement shall show the source of the flavor.<p>

	Distributors of pet food employing such flavor designation or claims on the labels of
	the product distributed by them shall, upon request, supply verification of the
	designated or claimed flavor to the Director.<p>

  (b)	The designation "100%" or "All" or words of similar connotation shall not be used in
the brand or product name of a pet food if it contains more than one ingredient. 
However, for the purpose of this provision, water sufficient for processing, required
decharacterizing agents and trace amounts of preservatives and condiments shall not be
considered ingredients.<p>

  (c)	The term "meat" and "meat by-products" shall be qualified to designate the animal from
which the meat and meat by-products are derived unless the meat and meat by-products
are from cattle, swine, sheep, and goats.  For example, "horsemeat" and "horsemeat by-products".<p>

  (d)	The name of the pet food shall not be derived from one or more ingredients of a
mixture to the exclusion of other ingredients and shall not be one representing any
components of a mixture of a pet food product unless all components or ingredients are
included in the name except as specified by Regulations PF3(a), (e), or (f); Provided,
That if any ingredient or combination of ingredients is intended to impart a distinctive
characteristic to the product which is significant to the purchaser, the name of that
ingredient or combination of ingredients may be used as a part of the name of the pet
food if:<p>

	(1)	The ingredient or combination of ingredients is present in sufficient quantity to
impart a distinctive characteristic to the product;<p>

	(2)	It does not constitute a representation that the ingredient is present to the
exclusion of other ingredients; and<p>

	(3)	It is not otherwise false or misleading.<p>

  (e)	When an ingredient or a combination of ingredients derived from animals, poultry, or
fish constitutes 95% or more of the total weight of all ingredients of a pet food
mixture, the name or names of such ingredient(s) may form a part of the product name
of the pet food; Provided, That where more than one ingredient is part of such product
name, then all such ingredient names shall be in the same size, style, and color print.<p>

  (f)	When an ingredient or a combination of ingredients derived from animals, poultry or
fish constitutes at least 25% but less than 95% of the total weight of all ingredients of a
pet food mixture the name or names of such ingredient or ingredients may form a part
of the product name of the pet food only if the product name also includes a primary
descriptive term such as "meatballs" or "fishcakes" so that the product name describes
the contents of the product in accordance with an established law, custom or usage or
so that the product name is not misleading.  All such ingredient names and the primary
descriptive term shall be in the same size, style and color print.<p>

  (g)	Contractions, or coined names referring to ingredients shall not be used in the brand
name of a pet food unless it is in compliance with Regulations PF3 (a), (d), (e), or (f).<p>

<p>

REGULATION PF4.	EXPRESSION OF GUARANTEES<p>

<p>

  (a)	The sliding scale method of expressing a guaranteed analysis (for example, "protein 15-18%") is prohibited.<p>

<p>

  (b)	Pursuant to Section 6(3) IC 1971 15-5-13, pet foods containing 6.5% or more mineral
elements shall include in the guaranteed analysis the minimum and maximum
percentages of calcium (Ca) and salt (NaCl), and the minimum percentages of
phosphorus (P) and iodine (I), if added.  Minerals, except salt (NaCl), when
quantitatively guaranteed, shall be stated in terms of percentage of the element.  The
label of the pet food which is formulated as and represented to be a mineral supplement
shall include a guarantee of all the minerals contained in the ingredient statement.<p>

  (c)	Pursuant to Section 6(3) IC 1971 15-5-13, the label of the pet food which is formulated
as and represented to be a vitamin supplement, shall include a guarantee of the
minimum content of each vitamin declared in the ingredient statement.  Such vitamin
guarantees shall be stated in units or milligrams per pound or ppm, as provided herein;
Vitamin E in USP or International Units; Vitamin A, other than precursors of Vitamin
A, in USP Units, Vitamin D in USP Units; all other vitamins as true vitamins, not
compounds, except pyridoxine hydrochloride, choline chloride, and thiamine
hydrochloride; oils and concentrates containing vitamin A or vitamin D or both may be
additionally labeled to show vitamin content in units per gram; and providing that the
term "d-pantothenic acid" be used in stating the pantothenic acid guarantee.<p>

  (d)	The vitamin potency of pet food products distributed in containers small than 1 lb. may
be guaranteed in approved units per ounce.<p>

  (e)	If the label of a pet food does not represent the pet food to be either a vitamin or a
mineral supplement, but does include a table of comparison of a typical analysis of the
vitamin, mineral, or nutrient content of the pet food with levels recommended by a
recognized animal nutrition authority, such comparison may be stated in the units of
measurement used by the recognized authority.  The statement in a table of comparison
of the vitamin, mineral, or nutrient content shall constitute a guarantee, but need not be
repeated in the guaranteed analysis.  Such table of comparison may appear on the label
separate and apart from the guaranteed analysis.<p>

<p>

REGULATION PF5.	INGREDIENTS<p>

<p>

  (a)	The maximum moisture in all pet foods shall be guaranteed and shall not exceed
78.00% or the natural moisture content of the constituent ingredients of the product,
whichever is greater.  Pet foods such as those consisting principally of stew, gravy,
sauce, broth or juice which are so labeled, may contain moisture in excess of 78.00%.<p>

  (b)	Each ingredient of the pet food shall be listed in the ingredient statement, and names of
all ingredients in the ingredient statement must be shown in letters or type of the same
size.  The failure to list the ingredients of a pet food in descending order by their
predominance by weight in non-quantitative terms may be misleading.  Any ingredient
for which the Association of American Feed Control Officials has established a name
and definition shall be identified by the name so established.  Any ingredient for which
no name and definition has been so established shall be identified by the common or
usual name of the ingredient.  Brand or trade names shall not be used in the ingredient
statement.<p>

  (c)	The term "dehydrated" may precede the name of any ingredient in the ingredient list
that has been artifically dried.<p>

  (d)	No reference to quality or grade of an ingredient shall appear in the ingredient
statement of a pet food.<p>

<p>

REGULATION PF6.	DIRECTIONS FOR USE<p>

  (a)	The label of a pet food product which is suitable only for intermittent or supplemental
feeding or for some other limited purpose shall:<p>

	(1)	bear a clear and conspicuous disclosure to that effect; or<p>

	(2)	contain specific feeding directions which clearly state that the product should be
used only in conjunction with other foods.<p>

<p>

REGULATION PF7.	DRUGS AND PET FOOD ADDITIVES<p>

<p>

  (a)	An artificial color may be used in a pet food only if it has been shown to be harmless to
pets.  The permanent or provisional listing of an artificial color in the United States
Food and Drug Regulations as safe for use, together with the conditions, limitations,
and tolerances, if any, incorporated therein, shall be deemed to be satisfactory evidence
that the color is, when used pursuant to such regulations, harmless to pets.<p>

  (b)	Prior to approval of a registration application and/or approval of a label for pet food,
which contains additives, (including drugs, other special purpose additives, or non-nutritive additives) the distributor may be required to submit evidence to prove the
safety and efficacy of the pet food, when used according to directions furnished on the
label.  Satisfactory evidence of the safety and efficacy of a pet food may be:<p>

	(1)	When the pet food contains such additives, the use of which conforms to the
requirements of the applicable regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations,
Title 21, or which are "prior sanctioned" or "Generally Recognized As Safe" for
such use or<p>

	(2)	When the pet food itself is a drug as defined in Section 1(7) of IC 1971 15-5-13
and is generally recognized as safe and effective for label use or is marketed
subject to an application approved by the Food and Drug Administration under
Title 21, U.S.C. 360(b).<p>

<h1>Mycotoxins in Feed Grains</h1>
<p>

<center>July 18, 1996<p>

</center>
<p>

<b>		CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR MYCOTOXINS</b><p>

<p>

The Office of Indiana State Chemist (OISC) tests feeds and ingredients for mycotoxins.  Testing is performed for aflatoxin,
fumonisin zearelanoine, T-2 toxin  and vomitoxin or DON.  Animals differ in their reaction to these toxins.  FDA has established
the following guidelines according to livestock specie as to the maximum toxin level that can be safely fed.<p>

<p>


<table border width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td colspan=3><center><b>GUIDANCE LEVELS FOR TOTAL AFLATOXINS IN LIVESTOCK FEED</b></center>

<td>Other Feeds
<td>20 ppb</table>
<p>

<u><b>Fumonisin</u> </b>- Fumonisin is a recently identified mycotoxin.  Little published research is available relative to the safety of
fumonisin.  Fumonisin is known to cause equine leukoencephalomalcia in horses and pulmonary edema in pigs that eat
contaminated corn.  The Mycotoxin Committee of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians suggested
in 1993 the following guidelines for fumonisin:<p>

<p>


<table border width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td colspan=3><center>GUIDANCE LEVELS FOR FUMONISIN IN LIVESTOCK FEED</center>
<tr><td>Class of Animal
<td>Portion of Diet
<td>Maximum Fumonisin Level<tr><td>Horses
<td>Non-roughage portion of diet <p>

**Do not feed corn screenings**
<td>5 ppm<tr><td>Swine
<td>Total ration
<td>10 ppm<tr><td>Poultry
<td>Total ration
<td>50 ppm<tr><td>Beef cattle
<td>Non-roughage portion of ration
<td>50 ppm<tr><td>Dairy cattle
<td>
<td>No recommendation</table>
<b>NOTE: </b>Fumonisin can be extremely hazardous to horses.  <i><b>Corn screenings should never be fed to horses.</b></i>  When present in corn
or other grains, fumonisin can result in moldy corn poisoning or leukoencephalmalcia.  Common symptoms are horses become
disoriented, walk aimlessly, deranged behavior, colic, press head against solid objects, blindness, and death.  Horses receiving a
diet containing 5 ppm fumonisin are at risk.  Symptoms will develop in 7 to 35 days.  Confirmation of death resulting from equine
leukoencephalmalcia requires examination of the horse's brain for pathological features including softening and liquidifying of brain
tissue.  Prevalence of fumonisin will vary from year to year depending on weather conditions during the critical period of corn
silking and ear development.  Corn variety, insect damage and excess moisture during storage are also factors.  A problem can be
local or involve a specific storage bin or grower.  Feed manufacturers selling corn or horse feed containing corn should consider
conducting sufficient testing to ensure these feeds are safe for horses.  <i><b>The presence of fumonisin should alert feed manufacturers
to monitor ingredients, especially corn, and evaluate the level of corn in horse feeds.</b></i><p>

<p>

<u><b>Vomitoxin</b></u> - A toxin produced by several species of pink mold fusarium.  Toxin is also known as deoxynivalenol or DON.  It
is a natural toxin that forms when conditions are cold and wet where the grain is grown.  In animals, especially swine, it causes
vomiting, feed refusal, immune suppression, diarrhea, weight loss, and reduced milk production.  Wheat is common grain affected. 
Toxin may concentrate in wheat by-products.  In 1995, a dog food manufacturer recalled 16,000 tons of product ($20 million loss)
as a result of wheat by-product that contained &gt;30 ppm vomitoxin.  FDA has established the following guidelines:<p>

<p>


<table border width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td colspan=3><center><b>GUIDANCE LEVEL FOR VOMITOXIN IN LIVESTOCK FEED</b><tr><td></center>
<center>Class of Animal
<td><center>Portion of Diet</center>

<td><center>Maximum Vomitoxin Level<tr><td></center>

older than 4 months
<td>Grain &amp; grain by-products not to
exceed <b>50%</b> of the diet
<td>10 ppm<tr><td>Chickens
<td>Grain &amp; grain by-products not to
exceed <b>50%</b> of the diet
<td>10 ppm<tr><td>Swine
<td>Grain &amp; grain by-products not to
exceed <b>20%</b> of the diet
<td>5 ppm<tr><td>All other animals
<td>Grain &amp; grain by-products not to
exceed <b>40%</b> of the diet
<td>5 ppm</table>
<p>

<u><b>Zearelenone</u></b> - Zearelenone is another mycotoxin routinely checked by  the Office of Indiana State Chemist.  <i><b>The critical level,
that is the  level considered to be unsatisfactory, is 0.5 ppm.</b></i>  The literature reports the effects and levels as follows; however, I
haven't heard these levels as being suggested guidelines by FDA.  They are, at least in the interim, something to use as a guide:<p>

<p>

	<b></b>0.5 ppm may effect reproductive efficacy in young gilts	<b></b>1.0 ppm may induce animal feminization	<b></b>50-100 ppm can interfere with conception, ovulation, implantation, fetal development, and viability of newborn animals	<p>

<u><b>T-2 Toxin</u> </b>- There is not much known about this one, however, when asked, we consider <i><b>the critical level to be 0.5 ppm</b></i>,
based upon some North Dakota work.	<p>

<p>

At the present time in Indiana, we will use the levels cited here to determine whether an assay result is to be reported as
"Satisfactory" or "Unsatisfactory" under the Indiana Commercial Feed Law (IC15-5-13).<p>

<u><hr>
<p>

</u>The Feed Section in the Office of the Indiana State Chemist and Seed Commissioner administers the
<b>Indiana Commercial Feed Law</b> (IC 15-5-13) and represents the Food and Drug Administration on
matters relating to animal feeds pursuant to the <b>Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</b>.  The Feed
Administrator and his secretary administers the program by:  (1) obtaining the names and location of
firms that are subject to these laws by requiring <b>a license to manufacture and/or distribute commercial
feeds</b> in or into this state, (2)  by <b>label review</b> of new  products being offered and existing products
encountered in distribution, (3) by <b>review of inspections conducted and samples obtained</b>, and (4) by
taking appropriate <b>follow-up action</b> when significant violations are found.  Inspections are conducted
and samples are obtained by an inspection staff of six that are shared with the fertilizer and seed
programs.  Likewise, feed sample analyses are conducted by the Laboratory which serves all the
program areas of this offices.<p>

<p>

The Indiana Commercial Feed Law and its Rules deal primarily with:  (1)  definitions, (2) firm licensing,
(3)  labeling, (4) provisions for determining whether a feed is deemed to be misbranded or adulterated,
(5) feed tonnage reporting and payment of inspection fees, (6) authority for inspection, sampling and
analysis, (7) regulatory actions available, (8) judicial review, (9) protection of confidentiality (10)
cooperation with other agencies and (11) publication of information.<p>

<p>

The keystone to commercial feed industry oversight continues to be compliance with Good
Manufacturing Practices Regulations (<b>GMPR's</b>).  These requirements are primarily:  (1) proper
personnel, (2) suitable equipment, (3) appropriate ingredients, (4) accurate mixing, (5) the prevention of
hazardous cross-contamination, (6)  precise labeling, (7) accurate distribution records, (8) precise
inventory of  daily drug use, (9) acceptable analytical records, and (10) that no major complaints were
received.<p>

Table 1 is reported distribution of commercial feeds for 1995 by companies who are required to submit
quarterly feed tonnage reports and inspection fees for distributing in or into the State of Indiana.  This
tonnage represents the status of the product at the time of distribution.  Feeds reported as ingredients
were initially distributed in that form and are not included in the tonnage of mixed feeds reported in the
second part of the table.  These figures do not include feeds used in the manufacture of custom-mixed
feeds.  Table 2 is a recap of total commercial feeds figures since 1911.

<P>The Office of the Indiana State Chemist &amp; Seed
Commissioner maintains a cooperative agreement with the USDA
Seed Regulatory &amp; Testing Branch for mutual assistance
and cooperation in regulatory matters pertaining to seed
shipped into the state. The Federal Agency authorizes the
Indiana State Seed Commissioner to sample seed and inspect
records pertaining thereto, subject to the Federal Seed Act.
The Federal Seed Act, by virtue of its basic similarity to
the Indiana Seed Law, supplements the state law.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Inspectors employed by the Office of the Indiana State
Chemist &amp; Seed Commissioner are authorized to conduct
inspections and obtain samples of seed lots in possession of
Indiana dealers which were shipped in from out-of-state
sources. Any seed lot involved in &quot;interstate
commerce&quot; is subject to the both the Federal Seed Act,
as well as the state into which the lot was shipped. Samples
are tested at the state level, and if found to be in
violation, are submitted to the Seed Regulatory &amp; Testing
Branch in Beltsville, Maryland for further testing. Lot
records obtained at the time of sampling are also forwarded
to the federal authorities for additional investigation to
determine the most responsible party for the lot. </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The cooperative agreement between the Office of Indiana
State Chemist &amp; Seed Commissioner and the USDA SR&amp;TB
provides a comprehensive enforcement network for both
intrastate and interstate seed commerce. It protects not only
the seed consumer (farmer) but also the Indiana Seedsman
receiving seed from out-of-state shippers for further
retail.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Decisions on enforcement action on interstate violations
rests solely with the USDA Seed Regulatory &amp; Testing
Branch. Upon completion of investigations, warning and/or
charges are brought against the violator for violations
documented.</P>

<CENTER><H1>Seasonal Issues &amp; Concerns</H1>
<P>The following topics are some of the current
issues/concerns that the office of Indiana State Seed
Commissioner has been involved with in regard to inspectional
observations and &quot;frequently asked questions&quot;
received from seedsmen and consumers in the state of Indiana.
This listing will be continually updated to address new
issues and answer new questions that surface during the
current season.</P>

<CENTER><P><A name="treatmentcolor">
 </A> <B>Adequate Coloration on Treated
Seed</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P>An area of concern particularly during the spring and
fall seeding season in 1996 involved the use of seed
treatments and final appearance of treated seed once
pesticides had been applied to provide for protection from
certain diseases and organisms once the seed was planted. The
concern is the lack of &quot;adequate coloration&quot;
applied to treated seed to provide an adequate
&quot;contrast&quot; to that of untreated grain. </P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P>The requirement to &quot;dye&quot; treated seed a
contrasting color is contained in regulations of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, administered by FDA in the
United States. Section 2.25 of Regulation 408, which states,
in part:</P>
<P><I>2.25 </I><B>Grain seed treated with poisonous
substances; color identification to prevent adulteration of
human and animal food.</B></P>
<P><I>... A suitable color for this use is one that is in
sufficient contrast to the natural color of the food seed as
to make admixture of treated, denatured seeds with good food
easily apparent, and is so applied that it is not readily
removed.</I></P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P>The Office of the Indiana State Chemist &amp; Seed
Commissioner cooperates with FDA under written contract to
perform inspections and enforce various regulations requested
by FDA in the administration of the F,D, &amp; C Act. The
major concern with improperly colored treated seed is the
potential for contamination of untreated grain, particularly
when individuals are tempted to dispose of a few remaining
bags of treated seed leftover after planting into a load of
grain destined for the local elevator. It therefore becomes a
&quot;food safety&quot; issue requiring serious concern. With
this in mind, let's explore the issues surrounding this
concern.</P>
<CENTER><P><B>What's the problem?</B></CENTER></P>
<P>During the fall planting season of 1996, OISC inspectors
began noticing several lots of wheat seed, labeled as being
treated, but showing no obvious signs of being dyed a
contrasting color. This seemed to be consistent with many of
the new seed treatment products introduced into the market
within the past few years, along with some of the established
products that may have been reformulated. Apparently, the use
of the traditional dyes used for many years, have been
replaced by newer &quot;food coloring&quot; agents that are
approved as &quot;food grade&quot; colorants. That, coupled
with the reduced rates of treatments used, apparently is
causing some seed that has been treated at recommended rates,
to come out of the treater with no coloration (red, blue,
purple, green, etc.,) showing on the seed. It has also been
noticed that some specific varieties of soft red winter
wheat, namely Patterson, do not stain well with the food
colorants being used. </P>
<P><BR> </P>
<CENTER><P><B>How can it be corrected?</B></CENTER></P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P>Chemical suppliers of seed treatment products are
suggesting that the treater simply add some additional
colorant to the batch to provide a heavier concentration of
the coloring agent. This seems to adequately correct the
problem and results in a product that does come out with
enough of a contrasting color to be distinguished from
untreated grain of the same kind. Perhaps other types of
&quot;surfactants&quot; can be used to enhance the final
color, i.e., provide better coverage to result in a better
stained seed.</P>
<P><BR> </P>
<CENTER><P><B>A word of Caution to the those who treat seed
...</B></P>
<P><BR> </P>
</CENTER><P>Pay close attention to the final seed product
coming out of your treaters. Is it adequately colored? Can
you detect an obvious color difference between the treated
seed and untreated grain? Don't take things for granted. If
it doesn't look right, make some adjustments to compensate
for the lack of coloration. The Office of the State Chemist
&amp; Seed Commissioner will continue to monitor this
situation in the coming season to fulfill our obligations to
FDA in enforcing the F,D, &amp; C Act. Seed lots encountered
by inspectors in retail channels which have been treated with
pesticides that show no obvious coloration will be handled
appropriately to avoid the potential for contamination of
untreated grain. </P>
<HR><H2><BR> </H2>
<CENTER><P><A name="germtest">
 </A><B>Germination Test Date Documentation</B> </P>
</CENTER><P><BR> </P>
<P>Seed laws require the labeler to state the &quot;date of
test&quot; on the label as an indication of
&quot;freshness&quot; of the seed. Section 4(h) of the
Indiana Seed Law mandates the labeler to show &quot;the
calendar month and year&quot; the test was completed to
determine such percentages. That month and year should
correspond to a test that was completed on the lot to
determine quality, on which label claims were based. As an
example, if the only test performed on the lot was done in
November 1995, <I>it is a violation</I> of this section to
show a test date of <B>January 1996</B>. The principle of
&quot;truth-in-labeling&quot; applies.</P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P><B>About testing ....</B></P>
<P><BR> </P>
<P>The Indiana Seed Law requires that seed be tested to
document label guarantees. Section 6(a)(1) states:
&quot;<I>It is unlawful for any person to distribute
agricultural or vegetable seeds within this state (1) unless
the test to determine the percentage of germination required
by sections four and five shall have been completed within a
nine (9) month period, exclusive of the calendar month in
which the test was completed immediately prior to
distribution.&quot;</I></P>
<P>Some key points made by this section include (1) a test
must be made to determine seed quality and to support label
claims, (2) the test to rely on would be the most
&quot;recent&quot; one made immediately prior to
distribution, and (3) the test information is valid for a
period of nine months.</P>
<P><B>Who must do the testing?</B></P>
<P>The law does not require that testing be done by any
particular laboratory. It simply states that a test must be
done. This can include tests performed by a seed
certification agency, other commercial laboratories, the
state laboratory, or an &quot;in-house&quot; laboratory
maintained by the seedsman.</P>
<HR><P><BR> </P>
<P><BR> </P>
<CENTER><P><A name="carryover">
 </A> <B>Responsibilities for Relabeling Carryover
Seed</B></CENTER></P>
<P>When agricultural and vegetable seeds remain in the
inventory of a distributor after the germination test has
expired (9 months) the seed must be removed from sale or
relabeled. New percentages of germination and hard seeds,
where applicable, and the new germination test date may be
entered on the tags previously attached to the seed only if
these items are inserted in such a way as to be clearly
legible and the old percentages of germination, hard seeds,
and the date of test are completely obliterated. In all cases
where such changes are necessary the attachment of new tags
is advised.</P>
<P><I>The person upon whose premises the seed is located
shall be held responsible for obtaining the new test and for
subsequent relabeling of the seed.</I></P>

The Indiana Seed Law, IC 15-4-1, was first enacted in 1921 to serve as a basic "truth-in-labeling" law designed to provide consumers with important information relating to
product quality and identity.  The law regulates both agricultural and vegetable seeds sold
in the state.  "Agricultural" seeds are those of legumes, grasses, forages, cereals, and fiber
crops.  Included in this category are lawn and turf seeds.  "Vegetable" seeds are those of
crops grown commercially and in home gardens and are commonly known as vegetables. 
Seeds grown strictly for their ornamental value (flower seeds, for example) are not
included.<p>

<p>

The law  requires all seeds to be labeled truthfully regarding their identification, purity,
and viability.  Basic quality information relating to germination and weed seed
contamination are required to provide the purchaser important information to make
intelligent purchases.  The law also classifies certain weed seeds as "noxious weeds" and
restricts their presence in seed offered for seeding purposes.<p>

<p>

<p>
<center><P><A name="Inspection"></A></P></center>
<center></u><b>Inspection Program</b>  <p></center>

</center>
The <U><A HREF="inspect/inspect.htm">inspection staff</A></U> of the Indiana State Chemist and Seed Commissioner provides
marketplace surveillance throughout the state through inspectional visits to all retail sales
outlets offering seed products for sale.  These products routinely consist of various
agricultural crop seeds, forage seeds, lawn seeds and vegetable seeds.  Samples are
obtained through official sampling methods and are analyzed in the state seed laboratory
to determine compliance with labeled guarantees.<p>

<p>

Companies authorized through Indiana Seed Permits for seed distribution currently
number 415.  A staff of 6 field inspectors make over 1,500 inspectional visits to individual
seedsmen, dealers, and distributors offering seed products for sale.  Approximately 90
different agricultural and vegetable crop kinds are sampled and inspected each year. 
Samples are collected from over 360 individual companies responsible for the labeling of
such seed distributed through the numerous dealer-distributor locations in the state. 
Samples are typically collected from over 450 different dealer/seedsman locations in the
state.  The State Seed Laboratory  examines over 16,000 guarantees made for these
products.  Such guarantees include % Pure Seed, % Inert Matter, % Other Crop Seed, %
Weed Seed, Noxious Weeds, and Germination claims.<p>

<center>Inspectional Coverage<p></center>

<p>

</center>
The primary activities of seed law enforcement in Indiana are inspection of seed products
in the marketplace and subsequent sampling of those products which are offered for sale
to the consumer to determine compliance with label guarantees.  Each year, several
thousand different lots of agricultural and vegetable seeds are inspected and sampled as a
part of the overall monitoring process of the industry.  During the sampling and inspection
of the various seed lots encountered in the marketplace, seed lot size is documented for
each sample obtained.  This information is used to assess inspectional coverage of the
various seed "crop kinds" offered for sale.  Information relating to seed distribution by
seedsman is also used to target those "major" distributors for proper coverage in relation
to overall share of the market in the state.<p>

<p>

Historically, certain seed crops are more prone to "quality" violations (weed seed
contamination, pure seed percentage, germination, etc.) than others.  Hence, as the figures
in the following tables indicate, we concentrate more inspectional work towards those
kinds where problems are more likely to occur.  This is evident in the figures shown for
inspectional coverage of crops such as alfalfas, clovers, and grasses.<p>

<p>

The following tables show the percentage of total distribution of each crop kind sampled,
comparing the total amount distributed of each crop kind versus the sum of the total of the
lot sizes of each sample obtained.<p>

</b>The Indiana State Seed Laboratory functions as the testing arm of the Office of the State
Chemist and Seed Commissioner to verify seed quality in reference to label claims made
for seed being offered for sale.  Official testing is performed on all inspector-drawn
samples taken for enforcement purposes.  The laboratory also offers a<B><U><A HREF="testfee.htm"> "service testing
program" </B></U></A> for all Indiana residents and consumers who wish to have saved seed tested to
evaluate overall quality.  Testing fees vary depending on sample type and number of
components to be tested.<p>

<p>

The Indiana State Seed Laboratory is an active member of the Association of Official Seed
Analysts (AOSA) and the methods used for sample preparation and analysis in the
laboratory are those approved by the Association.  Under such "Rules For Testing Seeds"
a standard analysis has been developed in conjunction with the enforcement of labeling
laws that furnishes information as to the composition of the seed sample and the ability of
the seed to produce plants. The rules, which are routinely followed, summarize and make
available the accumulated experience of seed analysts.<p>

</b><p>

Product analysis violations for 1995 were assessed and appropriate follow-up action was
assigned to bring about compliance.  Stop sale and/or relabel orders were issued on 168
lots of seed found to be in violation of the law as a result of laboratory analysis. 
Additional enforcement action was taken on 156 lots of seed involving stop sale orders
issued for labeling and other infractions of the law during routine marketplace surveillance. 
Such overall enforcement action resulted in "relabeling" orders for 1,235,556 pounds of
seed and stop sale orders for 674,104 pounds of seed.  <p>

<p>

<center><b>Inspected Seed Lots Out of Compliance</center>
<p>

<p>

</b>Under the most perfect conditions of sampling and testing seeds, some variation will occur
in the purity, germination, and noxious weed seed results if repeated tests are made. 
Tolerances adopted by the Association of Official Seed Analysts and policy guidelines are
applied to test results to compensate for sampling and analytical variations.<p>

<p>

If the test result on a sample is below the guarantee by any amount equal to or less than
the allowance, the sample is considered correctly labeled.  If the deficit is between one and
two times this value, the infraction is considered to be a "minor violation" of the law, and
the dealer is required to change the labeled claim on the unsold portion of the lot to
correspond to the analysis found by the test.  If the result is more than twice the allowance
it is termed a "serious violation" and the seed is ordered to be removed from sale until
relabeling is approved.  Seed lots found to be mislabeled with respect to labeling
requirements under the law are termed "label violations" and the dealer is expected to
make appropriate corrections where necessary.<p>

<b>Section 230.40  Label Requirements</b><p>

<p>

The label or tag for each container of agricultural, vegetable or
other seeds as defined in the Act shall contain the seed analysis
information required in Section 4 of the Act, be in compliance with
prohibitions in Sections 5 and 5.1 of the Act, and comply with
rules pertaining to labeling required under the Federal Seed Act (7
U.S.C. 1551 et seq.) and the following:<p>

A.	The name of the kind or kind and variety for each agricultural
seed component present, either separately or collectively in
excess of 5 percent of the whole, and the percentage by weight
of each in the order of its predominance.  Where more than one
component is required to be named, the word "mixture" or the
word "mixed" shall be shown conspicuously on the label or tag. 
Except, a blend of two or more varieties of a kind may be sold
as a blend or mixture; provided, that:<p>

	1.	the kind name followed by the statement, "Varieties Not
Stated", shall be shown conspicuously on the label or
tag, and <p>

	2.	if the seed comes within the definition of "hybrid" in
the Federal Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1551 et seq.) or Rules (7
C.F.R. 201.2(y) and 201.11a), and as amended in future
amendments, the seed may be labeled as "hybrid".<p>

B.	Origin (State or foreign country), if known, of alfalfa, red
clover, white clover and field corn (except hybrid corn).  If
the origin is unknown, the fact shall be stated.<p>

C.	For agricultural or vegetable seed sold from vehicles, bins or
other bulk containers, to which the purchaser has access
before buying, to examine the seed and the label thereof, a
complete label shall be attached to such vehicle, bin, or
other bulk container in a conspicuous place on the exterior of
said container or a placard conspicuously displayed with the
information required in Sections 4.0 through 5.1 of the
Illinois Seed Law and this rule.  All seed must be packaged in
the presence of the purchaser.  A label or tag meeting all
requirements of the Illinois Seed Law and Rules shall be
supplied to the purchaser if the seed is from one container
and/or one lot and in quantities of:<p>

	1.	Agricultural seed or any mixture thereof, 10 pounds of
more.<p>

	2.	Lawn and/or Turf Grass seed or any mixture thereof, 4
pounds or more.<p>

	3.	NOTE:  The labeling requirements for vegetable seeds sold
in bulk quantities of 1 pound or more shall be deemed to
have been met if the seed is weighed from a properly
labeled container in the presence of the purchaser.<p>

D.	Net Weight.  All net weight labeling shall be consistent with
the requirements of the Illinois Weights and Measures Act
(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, Ch. 147, paragraph 101 et seq.) and its
Rules.  The net weight information must appear on the
container and may also appear on the seed label or tag if

container of certified seed, if offered for sale as certified
seed, shall meet all the requirements for agricultural or
vegetable seeds and in addition shall have attached thereto a
tag issued for such seed by the certifying agency.<p>

F.	Sample Label For Single Agricultural Seed.  The label shown in
Exhibit A is for a single agricultural seed and provides for
a suitable arrangement of required labeling data.  This label
may be used for hybrid corn or a special label may be used
omitting Origin, Hard Seed, and Total Germination And
Hard Seed on the label.  The label shown in Exhibit A may be
used for mixtures of agricultural seeds by adding extra lines
for the components, germination and test dates (under the Kind
of Seed).  Where grown (origin) is required for alfalfa, red
clover, white clover, and field corn (except hybrid corn). 
If the origin is unknown, the fact shall be stated.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Section 230.50  Relabeling Seed After Expiration of Germination
Date</b><p>

<p>

When agricultural seeds, as defined in the Act, remain in the
inventory of a distributor or dealer after the germination test has
expired the seed must be removed from sale or relabeled.  New
percentages of germination, hard seeds or dormant seeds, total
germination and hard seed, and the new date of germination may be
entered on the labels or tags previously attached to the seed only
if these items are inserted in such a way as to be clearly legible
and the old percentages of germination, hard seeds or dormant
seeds, total germination and hard seed, and date of germination are
completely obliterated.  In all cases where such changes are
necessary, the attachment of new labels or tags is advised.  The
person upon whose premises the seed is located shall be held
responsible for obtaining the new test and for subsequent
relabeling of the seed.<p>

<b>Section 230.80  Fee Charges for Requested Official Seed Sampling
and for Seed Samples Submitted for Purity Analysis, Noxious Weed
Test and Germination Test</b><p>

<p>

There are three tests: the purity analysis, which includes an
Illinois Noxious weed seed examination, the germination test, and
the noxious weed seed test.<p>

A.	Samples for seed testing shall be tested in the order of
receipt during the period between July 1 to June 30 of each
year and charges made in accordance with the fee schedule
established under Section 230.80.<p>

<p>

B.	Fee charges for each seed sample submitted for purity analysis
shall be as follows:<p>

	1.	$5.00 each for timothy, clovers, alfalfas, cereal grains,
vetch, oil seed crops, such as soybeans, rape, sunflowers
and such other oil seed crops, and sudangrass.<p>

	2.	$6.00 each for redtop, bluegrasses, bentgrasses, smooth
brome, ryegrass, fescues, and native grasses (see Section
230.150).<p>

	3.	Seed Mixtures.  The charge for seed mixtures (in which
more than one kind of crop seed is present to the extent
of 5% or more) is the total of the fee for the kind of
crop seed in the mixture having the highest fee and 50%
of the fees applicable to the other kinds in the mixture.<p>

	4.	The charge for kinds not listed will be comparable to a
similar kind.<p>

	5.	The State Seed Laboratory shall not be obligated to
analyze for purity and/or test for germination any
uncleaned, unprocessed, and other time-consuming sample,
or any sample which obviously does not meet State Seed
Law requirements.<p>

<p>

C.	Fee charges for germination tests of seed shall be as follows:<p>

	1.	$8.00 each for seed mixtures and native grasses (see

will be given an Illinois noxious weed seed examination unless
other states' noxious weed seed examinations are specified.<p>

<p>

F.	Additional test charges:<p>

	1.	An additional charge of $15.00 will be made for each "Rush" test sample.  When speed is important, a "Rush"
order insures that tests are begun the day your sample
arrives (except for weekends and holidays).<p>

	2.	A purity analysis can usually be completed within a few
hours unless a complex mixture of seeds is involved.  A
request for a phone report will be fulfilled.  All
telephone reports will be made "collect" to person
requesting the tests.<p>

<p>

G.	Billing procedure and analysis invoice:<p>

<p>

<b>Section 230.90  Sampling in the Administration of the Act</b><p>

<p>

A.	General Procedure.<p>

	1.	In order to secure a representative sample, equal
portions shall be taken from evenly distributed parts of
the quantity of seed to be sampled.  Access shall be had
to all parts of that quantity.  When more than one
trierful of seed is drawn from a bag, different paths
shall be followed.  When more than one handful shall be
taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be taken from well-separated points.<p>

	2.	Free-flowing seed.<p>

		a.	For free-flowing seed in bags or bulk, a probe or
trier shall be used.<p>

		b.	For small free-flowing seed in bags a probe or trier
long enough to sample all portions of the bag should
be used.<p>

	3.	Non-free flowing seed, such as certain grass seed or
uncleaned seed, difficult to sample with a probe or
trier, shall be sampled by trusting the hand into the
bulk and withdrawing representative portions.  The hand
is inserted in an open position and the fingers are held
closely together while the hand is being inserted and the
portion withdrawn.<p>

	4.	As the seed is sampled, each portion shall be examined. 
If there appears to be lack of uniformity, the portions
shall not be combined into a composite samples but shall
be retained as separate samples or combined as to form
individual-container samples to determine such lack of
uniformity as may exist.<p>

	5.	When the portions appear to be uniform, they shall be
combined to form a composite sample.<p>

<p>

B.	Bulk.  Bulk seeds shall be sampled by inserting a long probe
or thrusting the hand into the bulk as circumstances require
in at least seven uniformly distributed parts of the quantity
being sampled.  At least as many trierfuls or handfuls shall
be taken as the minimum which would be required for the same
quantity of seed in bags of a size customarily used for such
seed.<p>

<p>

C.	Bags.<p>

	1.	For lots of six bags or less, each bag shall be sampled. 
A total of at least five trierfuls shall be taken.<p>

	2.	For lots of more than six bags, five bags plus at least
10 percent of the number of bags in the lot shall be
sampled.  Round off numbers with decimals to the nearest
whole number, raising 0.5 to the next whole number. 
Regardless of the lot size, it is not necessary to sample
more than thirty bags.  Example:<p>

<p>

		No. Bags in Lot --------7   10   23   50<p>

		No. Bags to Sample------6    6    7   10<p>

<p>

		No. Bags in Lot-------100  200  300  400<p>

		No. Bags to Sample-----15   25   30   30<p>

<p>

	3.	Samples shall be drawn from unopened bags, when
available.  Samples may be drawn from open bags if unopen
bags are not available and the identity of seed has been
preserved.  When sampling open bags, probe the lower
portion of the bag if possible.  The seed near the
opening of the bag may be contaminated.<p>

<p>

D.	Small Containers.  In sampling seed in small containers which
it is not practical to sample as required in subsection c,
entire unopened containers may be taken in sufficient number
to supply a minimum size sample as required in subsection e
of this Section.  The sample may consist of the contents of
one container, or two or more containers when combined.<p>

<p>

E.	Size of Sample.  The following are minimum sizes of samples
of agricultural seed to be submitted for purity analysis and
germination test.  For germination test only submit one-half
the following required quantities:<p>

	1.	Two ounces (56 grams) of grass seed such as timothy,
redtop, bluegrass, or seeds not larger than these.<p>

	2.	Five ounces (140 grams) of red clover, sweetclover,
alsike, alfalfa or seeds of similar size.<p>

	3.	Eight ounces (224 grams) of fescue, ryegrass or seeds of
similar size, except 12 ounces (336 grams) of smooth
brome.<p>

	4.	Thirty-six ounces (1000 grams) of wheat, rye, barley,
soybeans, corn, or seeds of similar or larger size.<p>

	5.	Vegetable seed samples shall consist of at least 400
seeds per sample for germination purposes.<p>

<p>

F.	Information to be Given on Sample for Testing.<p>

	1.	Name and address of owner.<p>

	2.	Kind of seed.<p>

	3.	Variety (if known).<p>

	4.	Lot number or other stock identification.<p>

	5.	Year grown, month of harvest (if known) and where grown.<p>

	6.	Type test desired (whether purity only, germination only,
or both).<p>

	7.	Information as to year grown, month of harvest (if
known), and where grown must accompany each sample of
seed sent for testing.  If the seed is old and only a
check of germination is desired, the analyst will not
waste time and delay your laboratory report, in retesting
if first germination percentage is low.  The State Seed
Laboratory also needs this information on new seed since
some must be prechilled for germination.<p>

<p>

G.	Forwarding Samples to Seed Laboratory.<p>

	1.	Samples of seed on which tests are desired should be sent
to the Illinois Department of Agriculture, Division of
Plant Industries and Consumer Services, Bureau of
Laboratories, State Fairgrounds, P.O. Box 1981,
Springfield, Illinois 62794-9281.  Each sample should be
carefully identified with the kind, variety, and lot
number of the seed it represents and the name and address
of the person submitting the sample.  Be sure your seed
packets are breakproof and sift-proof.  Send your samples
by first class mail or parcel post.<p>

	2.	Specific instructions must be provided concerning the
type of test or analysis desired.  Also if there are any
special instructions for billing, providing extra copies of the report, "Rush" test, etc., they should be
indicated either on the sample container or in the
covering letter.<p>

	3.	The time required for testing depends upon two factors. 
One is the number of other samples being received by the
laboratory at the time the sample arrives and the other
is the time required to complete the test requested. 
Usually tests can be started within 1 to 3 days after the
sample is received.  However, during the heavy testing
period, January - February - March - April, this may be
extended to a week or more before samples can be tested. 
The time required for germination tests may be as long
as a month or more for some kinds of seed.  The average
germination testing period is between 7 - 10 days.<p>

<b>Section 230.100 Labeling Treated Seed</b><p>

All seed treated as defined in Section 4 of the Act shall be
labeled to show the following:<p>

A.	1.	Contents of label.  Any agricultural seed or any mixture
thereof or any vegetable seed or any mixture thereof for
seeding purposes that has been treated shall be labeled
in type no smaller than 8 points to indicate that the
seed has been treated and to show the name of any
substance or a description of any process (other than
application of a substance) used in such treatment in
accordance with this rule; for example:<p>

<p>

		Treated with __________________________________________<p>

						(Name of substance or process)<p>

<p>

		or ____________________________________________ Treated<p>

				(Name of substance or process)<p>

<p>

	2.	If the substance used in such treatment in the amount
remaining with the seed is harmful to humans or other
vertebrate animals, the seed shall also bear a label
containing additional statements as required by
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this rule.  The label shall
contain the required information in any form that is
clearly legible and complies with the Act and its rules. 
The information may be on the analysis tag, or label, or
on a separate tag, or it may be printed in a conspicuous
manner on a side or top of the container.<p>

<p>

B.	Name of substance.  The name of any substance as required by
paragraph (a) of this rule shall be commonly accepted coined,
chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.  Commonly
accepted coined names are free for general use by the pubic,
are not private trademarks, and are commonly recognized as
names of particular substances, such as thiram and captan. 
An example of a commonly accepted chemical (generic) name is hexachlorbenzene.<p>

<p>

C.	All Highly Toxic Substances.<p>

	1.	Seed treated with a highly toxic substance, if any amount
remains with the seed, shall be labeled to show a
representation of a skull and crossbones at least twice
the size of the type used for information required to be
on the label under paragraph A. and shall also include
in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting
color a statement worded substantially as follows:  "This
seed has been treated with Poison," "Poison treated," or
"Poison".  The word "Poison" shall appear in type no
smaller than 8 points.<p>

	2.	Any amount of such substances remaining with the seed is
considered harmful within the meaning of this rule.<p>

<p>

D.	Other harmful substances.  If a substance, other than one
which would be classified as a highly toxic substance under
paragraph C. of this rule, is used in the treatment of seed,
and the amount remaining with the seed is harmful to humans
or other vertebrate animals, the seed shall be labeled with
an appropriate caution statement in type no smaller than 8
point worded substantially:  "Do not use for food," "Do not
use for oil purposes" or "Do not use for food, feed, or oil
purposes."<p>

<p>

E.	No treated seed shall be re-packaged and sold without proper
warning labels.<p>

<p>

F.	Any substance used in the treatment of seed grains or seed
which might be used for feed or human consumption, which is
of a toxic nature, shall be colored so as to be readily
discernible as required by rules of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, as amended (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)<p>

<p>

G.	In the case of seed in bulk, the information required on the
labels of packaged seed shall appear on the container and the
invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such
seed.<p>

<p>

<p>

MS, SC, TX, WA; signed only CA, ID, ND, SD) along with the required filing fee (where
applicable) with the Commissioner/Director/Secretary of Agriculture, Seed Commissioner, or

buyer may commence legal proceedings against a Seller or assert such claim as a counterclaim or
defense in any action brought by the seller, at any time after the receipt of the report of
arbitration.<p>

arbitration under this section, any party may introduce the report of arbitration as evidence of the
facts found in the report, and the court may give such weight to the Council's findings and
conclusions of law and recommendations as to damages and costs, as the court may see fit based
upon all the evidence before the court.  The court may also take into account any findings of the
Council with respect to the failure of any party to cooperate in the arbitration proceedings,
including any findings as to the effect of delay in filing the arbitration claim upon the Council's
ability to determine the facts of the case.<p>

<B> The Association of American Seed Control Officials is an organization of seed regulatory officials from the 
United States and Canada.  The Association was organized in 1949, from an outgrowth of regional meetings held in various
parts of the United States. The members meet annually to discuss mutual concerns of seed law enforcement, to be 
updated on new developments in the seed industry, and to update the Recommended Uniform State Seed Law (RUSSL) which the organization
developed and maintains as a "model" law for states and federal programs.</B>

<b> PRESIDENT'S CORNER  </b>

</i><p>

Updates by<p>

<i>David F. Svik</i>, President<p>

Enclosed with this Newsletter is a copy of the AASCO Board members and all committees for the following
year.  There have been a few changes and additions to this list, so please check to see where you are
listed on the committees.  If you are, please contact your chairperson and let them know that you are
"hopefully" going to be an active member of the committee.  If you are a Chairperson, please get your
committee active and working now on committee business.<p>

<u>AOSCA and NASDA Meetings:</u><p>

As part of my duties as your President, I attended the AOSCA meeting in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, July 31-
August 4th and the NASDA meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, September 10-14, 1994.  I gave
"Greetings" to the AOSCA group and sat in on the Advisory meeting with Chuck Dale.  Chuck recently sent
out a very detailed meeting report to each of you.  While at the NASDA meeting, I visited with Eric Gates
while he was helping his Department host the meeting.  Eric has lined up a top-notch hotel for our 1996
AASCO meeting in New Orleans a few blocks from Bourbon Street so we should have a great location for
this meeting.<p>

The resolution on State Seed Regulatory and Testing programs approved at our annual meeting, which
I submitted to NASDA, was reviewed by their Policy and Planning Committee and combined with a similar
resolution from WASDA.  It was passed by the NASDA members on a voice vote during their general
session.<p>

<u>Status of the Plant Variety Protection Act:</u><p>

The House passed their version of the Plant Variety Protection Act last August after an eleventh hour try
to add a farmers' exemption failed in committee on a 10 to 10 vote.  I spoke today (October 7th) with a staff
person from the PVPA office and they said that if President Clinton didn't sign the bill today, then it would
go into law without his signature.  The law will go into affect in 180 days.  The PVPA office will begin
working on regulations soon to implement the law so they can meet the 180-day deadline.  The PVPA
office will also continue to send AASCO a copy of each letter sent to each breeder approving their variety
under the act for variety protection.  Copies will be sent to Niels Hansen-Trip, our Secretary, and kept on
file.  Should you ever need to review information on a specific variety, please contact Niels.<p>

<u>AASCO Membership for APHIS:</u><p>

I have received an official request from Polly Lehtonen of APHIS inquiring into the possibility of joining
AASCO.  They have regulatory duties under both the Federal Noxious Weed Act and also labeling, noxious
weeds, and staining requirements for imported agricultural and vegetable seed.  Our by-laws would
indicate that they are eligible for membership.  I will be contacting the Board members for their feelings on
this topic.  If you have ideas or comments about membership for APHIS, please contact me.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>AASCO OFFICIAL DEFINITIONS COMMITTEE</b><p>

This committee was formed at the business meeting of AASCO in 1993.  Larry Nees served as the
founding chairman of the committee but this duty was passed on to me, Dave Taylor, to allow him to spend
more time in other areas of the association.  AASCO feels that the inclusion of "official definitions" of terms
common to the seed industry into our official publication will assist in promoting uniformity throughout the
industry and affiliated seed organization for labeling, distribution and trade needs.<p>

I would like to briefly outline the procedure to be used in the function of this committee.  Further information
about the committee can be found in the AASCO official publication.<p>

1.      Proposed official definitions for terms may be submitted to the committee by control officials or any other
party interested in the seed industry, however <b>each and every submission</b> must be accompanied with
information to answer the following questions about each term definition;<p>

	a)  Why is the definition needed?<p>

	b)  How will it promote uniformity in the seed industry?<p>

	c)  What is the definition to be used for?<p>

	d)  When would the term be used?<p>

<p>

2.      Proposal as stated in (1) above must be received by the committee chairman before <b>May 15th</b> to receive
consideration as tentative status for the following year.  Any changes in terms currently in official or
tentative status must also be submitted with the above information by May 15th to receive consideration.<p>

<p>

3.      The committee will review the submitted information and those terms approved by the committee will be
submitted to AASCO board for approval and subsequent submission to the membership for approval at
each annual meeting.<p>

<p>

4.      All terms will remain in the tentative status for at least one year.  If no comments are received, upon the
approval of the membership at the next annual meeting, the term will be elevated to official status.<p>

<p>

5.      Requests for definitions to be placed in RUSSL must be done as a separate action through the RUSSL
review committee and appropriate procedures.  The Official Terms and Definitions section of the AASCO
Official Publication is a separate entity.  Consideration will be given to terms and definitions already in
existence in RUSSL before establishing any further definitions.<p>

MARYLAND UPDATE</b><p>

<u>Straw In Tall Fescue Seed</u><p>

Several Maryland sod producers have reported problems when seeding tall fescue this fall as a result of
stoppages caused by pieces of straw in the seed.  These pieces appear to be crushed straw, typically 3/8"
to 1" in length.  They are easily noticed when viewed thru plastic sample bags.  Due to the lightness of
these pieces, they do not noticeably affect the percentage of inert matter.  They do, however, cause
problems with Brillion seeders.<p>

<u>Undesirable Grass Seeds</u><p>

Despite the fact that Maryland's lawn and turf noxious weed seed list - also known as undesirable grass
seeds - has been in force for over seven years, we continue to experience an unacceptable high number
of violations.  During the fiscal year (July 1, 1993 - June 30, 1994), 18.9% of the lawn and turf seed
regulatory samples resulted in undesirable grass seed violations.  In the majority of cases it appeared that
these were due to failure to test component lots and/or the resulting mixture, or failure to adequately clean
mixing equipment.<p>

Those companies who are trying to comply with this labeling requirement seem to be having relatively few
violations.  Others appear to be making no effort to comply as evidenced by the fact that their labels never
declare any undesirable grass seeds other than annual bluegrass.  Additional regulatory efforts in this area
are planned for 1995.<p>

<u>Use of Brand Names</u><p>

A recently adopted revision to the Maryland Seed law regulations prohibits the use of a brand name as a
substitute for the variety name or to represent a specific variety.  The Maryland Seed Law permits the
labeling of seed by kind or kind and variety.  The new regulation precludes, however, the use of a brand
name in lieu of the variety name.<p>

<b>NEWS FROM NORTH DAKOTA</b><p>

North Dakota State Seed Department's new diagnostic lab is offering a wide variety of testing services both
on a service fee basis and for the Department's ongoing activities.  Steve Marquardt, the new Diagnostic
Lab Director, came on board in December of 1993 and has spent his first few months getting the lab set
up and establishing testing procedures.  Prior to coming to North Dakota, Steve, a Colorado native, was
the director of research for Ceres 2000, Inc., a Winter Haven, Florida plant diagnostics company.<p>

Some of the procedures being done at the present time are: electrophoresis testing for variety ID;
<u>Ascochyta</u> tests on peas and lentils; loose smut test on barley; testing for barley strip mosaic virus; treating
seed to determine if germination is enhanced by treatment; bacterial blight test on edible beans; test for
potato viruses A, M, X, Y, and S; potato leafroll virus test; tomato spotted wilt virus test; bacterial ring rot
test on potatoes; and blackleg test on canola.  Other testing will be done as required or needed.  These
services would be available to other states either on an as-needed basis or on a contract basis.  <p>

Once again, weather played a big role in North Dakota's seed production.  Some areas of the State were
plagued by extremely wet conditions through the whole season and as a result, seed quality is poor in
those areas.  Overall, quality and supply should be better than last year.<p>

<b>WYOMING DEPT OF AGRICULTURE</b><p>

The Wyoming Department of Agriculture (WDA) in 1994 directed its seed inspection efforts towards small
packets of seeds, most notably wildflower seed mixes.  This a  change from the past in that the WDA
usually inspected and sampled agricultural seeds.  The Department felt that additional effort was needed
towards the small packets in that many companies were distributing and selling seeds that were either
restricted or prohibited noxious weeds, or were mixes containing noxious weeds.<p>

Of 5,039 various seed packages and mixes inspected, 1,156 were found to be in violation of the Wyoming
Seed law.  The largest number of violations involved restricted and prohibited noxious weeds, while expired
germination dates ranked second.  At one dealer, 31 seed varieties were inspected, of which, all 31 were
found to be in violation of the Wyoming Seed law.<p>

USDA - AMS CODES FOR INTERSTATE SHIPPERS</b><p>

Some states require out-of-state shippers to have a Dealer's License.  Seed inspectors need to know if
a seed company is an out-of-state shipper to check if that company has a dealer's license.  If the label
shows the local dealer's name and the AMS Code for their interstate shipper, the inspector doesn't know
who the interstate shipper is.<p>

The Seed Regulatory and Testing Branch (SRTB) of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture maintains a list of Code Designations for interstate shippers.  FSA requires that
seed shipped must be labeled with the Shipper's name and address or an AMS code designated.  This
code is issued like "AMS-1234" for example.  The interstate shipper puts the consignee's name on the label
along with the code designation.  Currently there are 772 interstate shippers with an AMS code.<p>

In the past, the name of the Agricultural Marketing Service was the "Consumer and Marketing Service
(C&amp;MS), and others.  The codes then had "C&amp;MS" or "PMA" as a part of the letter prefix,  "C&amp;MS-1234"
for example.  So, if you see a code on a label in the format like "AMS-1234" or "C&amp;MS-456" or "PMA-1234"
it probably is an interstate shipper's code designation.  ALTHOUGH THE AMS CODES ARE
ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL, the SRTB makes this list available to Seed Control Officials on
request.<p>

Call 301-504-9430 or one of the following Regional Marketing Specialists to get a copy of the list or to
check on an AMS code.<p>

<b>LABELING REQUIREMENTS MAY CHANGE</b><p>

The present format for labeling seed has been in use for many, many years.  How many?  I do not know. 
My experience with regulating seed is approaching 35 years, and other than a brief time when Lawn and
Turf Seed was required to be labeled as to "Fine Texture" and "Coarse Kinds," there has been no changes. 
So the general format has served the needs of both the regulated industry and the consumers and to
survive for so many years, it has served both quite well.  However, as I look into the future, I would venture
to guess the format will change in the not to distant future.  Why?  The industry has undergone many
changes, including new plant breeding techniques, and shortly we will be regulating seed produced from
transgenetic plant material.  Keep in mind the consumer needs have also changed, and so we must satisfy
their needs as well.<p>

When the 1994 General Assembly amended the Virginia Seed Law, several amendments were "enabling"
legislation so that the Board of Agriculture (Virginia's rulemaking body) could address many issues by
regulations if and when it became necessary.  One amendment provided for the Board to adopt regulations
to properly regulate seed produced from transgenetic plant material.  There has been some closely
monitored soybean plots of transgenetic seed planted in Virginia that are resistant to Glyphosate
(Roundup).  It appears reasonable that we can expect to encounter within a reasonable period of time
many seeds produced by Bio-Technical methods.<p>

The seed industry in Virginia is not sure, nor is this department sure, what additional labeling will be
necessary, if any, to regulate seed produced by "Bio-tech."  However, the seed industry believes it will be
regulated, and it would be advantageous to be regulated by the Department of Agriculture under the State
Seed Laws rather than by another agency under another law.  Just another new challenge for Seed Control
Officials and something that AASCO's Long Range Planning Committee might want to address.<p>

<b>HIGHLIGHTS OF MIDWEST REGION INSPECTOR SEMINAR</b><p>

The first jointly sponsored Inspector Seminar was held September 13-15, 1994, at Purdue University in
West Lafayette, Indiana.  This training seminar was sponsored by the Office of Indiana State Chemist and
Seed Commissioner, Purdue University, the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and
the Association of American Seed Control Officials (AASCO).  It was the first of its kind to cover multiple
inspectional topics specific to the areas of feed, seed, and anhydrous ammonia inspections.  Registered
participants numbered 68 for the three-day event, and represented 16 states.  Personnel from Idaho,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin were in attendance.  The seminar included
first day topics of "Effective Communication Skills", "Effective Business Writing", "Conflict Management",
and "Stress Management" put on by Purdue University staff.  Day two included discussions about inspector
safety concerns, with a field trip to a local Purina Mills facility to hear an "Industry perspective" about safety
in the workplace and their concerns for inspectors and visitors in their facilities.  Half-day sessions were
conducted, addressing specific topics related to feed inspection, seed inspection, and anhydrous ammonia
inspection.<p>

AASCO served as the primary sponsor for the morning session on seed inspection and sampling.  A big
thank you goes out to fellow seed control officials Ken Rauscher of Michigan, and Mark Ringler of Illinois,
and to Steve Hurst of the Seed Regulatory &amp; Testing Branch of USDA for assisting with presentations on
the topics presented during the seed portion of the program.  Their assistance helped make the event a
success and one which I think all participants found something of interest and useful to them on the job. 
The overall event is currently being evaluated to determine if interest exists to continue it in future years.<p>

TIDINGS FROM TENNESSEE</b><p>

In November, 1992, I was moved from the Animal Industries Division where I was the Administrator for the
Quality and Standards Division, to fill the position of Feed, Seed, and Fertilizer Administrator.  The Feed,
Seed, and Fertilizer Section was like a stepchild being moved from division to division, and at one time,
was even its own division.  It was the vision of the director of Quality and Standards, Jimmy Hopper, to
give the section much more importance and responsibility.<p>

As soon as I took over, I went out into the field to see how our program worked.  I visited over 150
establishments across the state of Tennessee.  It was obvious that the inspectors didn't have enough time
to make thorough inspections, as the list of problems filled two sheets of paper.<p>

We now have nine inspectors and a chief inspector dedicated to Feed, Seed, and Fertilizer.  Our seed
sampling equipment has been updated and the training of inspectors intensified.  We plan to ask the USDA
for assistance in additional training in the near future.<p>

I was extremely impressed with the AASCO meeting held in Idaho a few weeks ago.  I met a number of
people who were very kind to me and volunteered to help in any way they could.  I appreciated their
hospitality and hope to attend future meetings.<p>

<b>ARIZONA APPOINTMENTS<p>

</b>On March 21, 1994, the Arizona Department of Agriculture Seed Testing Lab officially started testing
regulatory seed samples.  On April 11 we made state seed testing lab services available to farmers and
seed dealers.  The seed lab, as part of the State Agricultural Laboratory is located in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The state seed lab is currently staffed by two people:  Kathleen Willey, State Seed Analyst, and Marcos
Alvarez, Seed Lab Technician.<p>

Ms. Willey is a native of Iowa.  She joins the department with 15 years experience in seed analysis.  She
received her education at Iowa State University where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in botany. 
While attending Iowa State, she worked at the ISU Seed Science Center, training under Dr. Leroy Everson
and the staff in seed analysis.<p>

After graduation she moved to Pennsylvania and worked for Agvay Inc. testing for all types of turf grasses,
vegetables, flowers, herbs, and agronomic crops.  In 1981 she earned her RST (Registered Seed
Technologist).  She has worked for several other commercial companies--including ARCO Seed, George
J. Ball Company, and AMM Seed Testing.  Before moving to Arizona, Kathleen had worked six years for
the Kansas Department of Agriculture as the State Seed Lab Supervisor.  In 1988 she received the AOSA
(Association of Official Seed Analysts) Certified Seed Analyst certificate in both purity and germination
testing.  In Kansas she worked primarily with agronomic crops, turf grasses, native grasses, and flowers. 
She was also responsible for the seed lab administrative and fiscal duties.<p>

<p>

1995!  Another year of challenges and opportunities!  I hope your year will be a fruitful and positive one.  We, here
in the Cornhusker State are still recovering from our euphoria after waiting patiently for 22 years for a national
championship in football.  Sorry Penn State, maybe next year!<p>

<p>

<b>New AASCO Members?</b><p>

<p>

What's happening with AASCO?  We are growing in membership.  That's correct!  We have formally invited APHIS
to join our ranks.  Hopefully, in the next few weeks, we will receive dues from APHIS for 1994-95 and will add their
name to our membership list.  Many thanks to Malcolm Sarna for following up on their request for information.  Their
regulatory duties in enforcement of Title III, import provisions of the Federal Seed Act, allow them to join our ranks
under our Constitution and By-Laws.  Polly Lehtonen of APHIS indicates that she will be attending our meeting this
summer to discuss the APHIS revisions of the FSA Regulations.<b><p>

<p>

The "New Plant Variety Protection Act"<p>

<p>

</b>The ink is hardly dry on P.L. 103-349 and questions are already surfacing from producers and others about the
effect of the new PVPA.  I have been asked to give a short presentation to the Nebraska Certified Seed Growers
and Seed Trade at their February meeting on the new law.  Perhaps you will be covering the same topic in your
state.  Hopefully, we will all receive copies of the new law when it is published.  I have also suggested that Malcolm
and Ken check on the possibility of a person from the PVPA office attending our summer meeting to explain the
process of review along with the new changes and the potential effect on state seed laws.<p>

<p>

Enclosed with this newsletter is a copy of an article on the new PVP law by Diversity Magazine, which gave me
permission to reprint the article.  Also enclosed is an application for a subscription to the magazine.  For those of
you that are not familiar with Diversity, it is a news journal published by a non profit organization and deals with
articles covering a wide range of topics in the genetic resource community.  I am hoping they will provide us with
some sample copies to display at our summer meeting.<p>

<b>NASDA Midwinter Meeting</b><p>

<p>

Malcolm Sarna will again be representing AASCO at the NASDA Midwinter Meeting to be held in Washington D.C.
on March 6th.  NASDA has requested that each affiliate organization give a five minute report on it's purpose and
priority issues.  Malcolm and I will be working on our report in the near future.  If any of you have issues that you
feel should be addressed, please give us a call.  One of the issues we will continue to hammer on will be the support
we need by our Departments of Agriculture and NASDA for strong and viable seed programs in each and every
state.<p>

<p>

<b>Long Range Planning Survey</b><p>

<p>

All of our members recently received a survey from Chuck Dale asking for information on state seed programs.  It
is a somewhat detailed, but also very important questionnaire that I hope each of you will spend some quality time
in completing.  Every state seems to be going through the same trials with the reinvention and streamlining of
government.  Now the federal government has gotten into the act with first, the reorganization of USDA to now the 
"Contract with America".  Change is upon us and we can either be part of the answer or be run over by it.  Let's
have a 100% survey return!  The Planning Committee needs your ideas.<p>

<p>

<b>Labeling and Legislative Review</b><p>

<p>

Are you proposing changes to your seed laws or regulations this year?  If so, please consider sending copies to the
Labeling and Legislative Review Committee for review and comments.  The committee consists of represen- tatives
of AASCO, AOSA, AOSCA, USDA, SCST, and ASTA.  The comments are non binding and will provide you with
additional ideas and points of view on your proposals that may be of help.  So far this year, the committee has
received a proposal from one state.  If you have any questions on the functions of this committee, please give me
a call.<p>

<b>1995 Meeting in Michigan</b><p>

<p>

Requests for topics and ideas for the 1995 annual meeting in July have gone out from each regional president.  If
you have topics you would like to see covered at our meeting, please contact your regional president or Program
Chairman, Malcolm Sarna.  Please also consider giving a short talk or report at the meeting.  Your ideas are
important and we need your input!<p>

<b><u>CALIFORNIA REPORT</b></u><p>

<p>

Kathleen Harvey has been named to fill the position vacated by the retired Bob Skaggs.  As Program Supervisor,
Kathleen is responsible for the nursery regulatory, plant certification, and quality cotton programs in addition to seed
control activities.<p>

<p>

California continues work on establishing a mandatory mediation procedure for seed complaints.  It had been
anticipated that the new mediation procedure would be in place by January 1995, but questions raised during the
review process has sent staff back to the "drawing board."  While the delay has been disappointing to the seed
industry, it may be to their benefit.  After considerable discussions with our legal resources, it appears that California
may be able to incorporate the RUSSL notice for complaints into the new regulations.  The proposed regulations
"may" take effect January, 1996.  California's seed laboratory has moved to a new facility.  Their new address is:<p>

California Dept of Food &amp; Agric.<p>

Plant Pest Diagnostics Branch<p>

This is a reminder that California will be hosting the 1995 AOSA/SCST Annual Meeting in Sacramento, July 7 - 14,
1995.  The meeting will be held at the newly renovated Red Lion Hotel.  Rates will be $88+ tax for a single or double
room.  Hotel reservation cards will be included in the meeting registration packets to be mailed this spring.  For
additional information, please contact Debbie Meyer, Jim Effenberger, or Jackie Chesi by calling (916) 262-1100.

<b><u>THE INFORMED CONSUMER AND SEED REGULATION</u><p>

<p>

</b>Wildfires swept over many large areas in the Pacific Northwest during the summer of 1994, and predictably, federal
land managers and some private landowners were soon in the market for seed products to use in wildfire
rehabilitation projects.  Since we have encouraged it, some of these  people were on the phone with us, looking for
advice on where, how, and what to buy for their projects.  Discussions with these callers reinforced our belief that
there is a need to find a way to get information to consumers of seed products so that they are better informed about
buying good quality seed that meets their needs.  There were several issues in common among the inquiries we
fielded:<p>

<p>

1) the relationship of price to quality - many callers were not familiar with the concept of pure live seed, and getting
the "lowest bid" seemed to be a major concern; <p>

<p>

2) a lack of understanding of federal and state seed laws - the requirement to label and to have labels attached to
containers was not often known;<p>

<p>

3) confusion about certification and the use of the term "certified;"<p>

<p>

4) the difference between official sampling and testing, and testing for labeling and/or quality control, where to test,
and costs of testing;<p>

<p>

5) the meaning of an "all states' noxious weed" test.<p>

<p>

Because of the widespread interest in matters related to acquiring quality seed, and because there have been
instances of poor purchasing practices which have resulted in large ($1,000,000 or so) losses from use of seed
contaminated with weeds, the Oregon Department of Agriculture's Noxious Weed Program and the Seed Control
Program are developing a workshop aimed at providing information helpful in improving seed purchasing practices.<p>

<p>

The first presentation of the work-shop will be to employees of the Oregon Department of Transportation in early
February.  Area managers, project engineers and landscape architects will attend a four-hour session that provides
information on the issues mentioned above.  A handbook with a glossary, example labels and test report forms,
explanations of sampling procedures, and other related information will be given to each attendee.  It is expected
that two to four subsequent workshops will be provided to other audiences during 1995.<p>

<p>

In the summer of 1991, one National Forest in Oregon followed recommended procedures for sampling seed
purchased for a fire rehabilitation project and learned that spotted knapweed, a weed not known to occur within the
Forest, was a contaminant of the two lots purchased and delivered.  This seed, amounting to more than 100,000
pounds, was rejected and returned to the vendor and replaced with weed-free seed, avoiding the contamination of
a large area of the Forest with a new invading weed species.  Also in 1991, another National Forest in Oregon was
treating an invasion of Yellow Starthistle that had been introduced in contaminated seed.  Since this introduction,
an estimated $1,000,000 has been expended on treatments and court costs and settlement fees related to this
introduction.  It is obvious that knowledgeable and well-planned purchases of seed materials can save a lot in costs
and headaches, and we hope that a workshop on this topic contributes to developing the knowledge and planning
that can avoid situations like this.<p>

Recognizing the minimal inspector time to collect seed samples, collection will be targeted to labelers that fall under
the following criteria:  1) exceed the twenty percent average noncompliance rate, and    2) large distributors with
no history of sampling.  <p>

<b><u>NEWS FROM NORTH CAROLINA</b></u><p>

<p>

Following the 1993 seed production year in which producers of soybean and peanut seeds had many weather
related problems, 1994 looks bright.  The weather has been kind and PROSPECTS are for good supplies of high
quality seeds available for planting in 1995.<p>

<p>

During the 1995 legislative session, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture will propose changes in the seed
law which will enable the North Carolina Board of Agriculture to require variety labeling of agricultural and lawn and
turf seeds.  The required variety label- ing will be on a kind-by-kind basis, and those kinds of seed generally<p>

<p>

marketed "variety-not-stated" should not be affected.<p>

<b><u>MINNESOTA UPDATE</b></u><p>

<p>

Dr. Harley J. Otto, President and CEO of the Minnesota Crop Improvement Association, retired on January 23 after
more than 17 years in that capacity.  Prior to assuming that position he was on the staff of the University of
Minnesota, College of Agriculture.  In all, Dr Otto has provided over thirty years of leadership and service to
agriculture in Minnesota.  The association grew considerably under his leadership and again in 1994, more acreage
was certified in Minnesota than in any other state.  Upon retirement, his immediate plans are for some relaxation
in sunny south Texas.  His successor will be Dr. Gary Beal who held positions with Pioneer Hi-Bred International
and as President of his own business in Utah.<p>

<p>

In 1994 for the third year in a row, barley and spring wheat production in Minnesota was severely affected by scab,
a plant disease caused by the fusarium fungus.  Cool, damp growing conditions in June made infection rates high
causing many production fields to be virtually worthless.  Certified seed produc- tion suffered much the same fate
and farmers will again have difficulty meeting their needs for the varieties they prefer.  Discussions with farm groups
reveals that many farmers do not intend to plant spring wheat on their land in 1995 for the first time in over 50 years. 
Soybeans, dry beans, canola, and sunflower acreage will likely see at least some increase as a result.  A special
appropriation was made last year in the state legislature for emergency research aimed at developing resistant
spring wheat varieties.  Unfortunately, it could be  ten years or more before that research is able to provide a
potential solution to this problem.<p>

<p>

The University of Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station began collecting royalties on seed varieties in 1994. 
The first variety subject to the royalty was Stander barley and new releases of soybean varieties will be added this
year.  Part of the funds collected will be used to enforce their PVPA rights.  Publicity on their efforts will help the
seed regulatory program in achieving higher compliance with the act.<p>

<p>

The AASCO Long Range Planning and Development Committee, at the meeting in Boise, decided to survey
association members in order to collect specific information about each of the programs.  We hope to identify
successful strategies that not only help a seed regulatory program survive but more importantly, to be effective. 
The survey was mailed in late November and thirteen responses have been received so far.  If you have not
returned the completed survey, please do so as soon as possible.  If you have misplaced your copy, please contact
Charles Dale of Minnesota for another one.  The information collected will be summarized and distributed at the next
meeting in Michigan.<p>

<p>

The next meeting of the AOSCA Advisory Committee will be on February 24 in San Diego, California.  Charles Dale
of Minnesota is the AASCO representative on the committee.  If there are any issues you want discussed at this
meeting, please let me know.<p>

<b><u>PENNSYLVANIA NOTE</u></b> <p>

<p>

Pennsylvania continues to find that lawn seed mixture violations continue to be the area where most violations are
occurring.  Over 30% of the lawn mixtures sampled were in violation.  The largest percentage of these were
components not in tolerance and excessive amounts of noxious weeds - Undesirable Grass Seed.<p>

<p>

We inspected and  tested 1,768 seed lots in 1994.  there were over 11% of these in violation.<p>

<b><u>NEW MEXICO'S FRAMEWORK</u></b><p>

<p>

The New Mexico Department of Agriculture is entrusted with enforcement of the New Mexico Seed Law.  We are
located on the campus of New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The Department is structured
under the Board of Regents of New Mexico State University, and all of the employees work for the university, <b>not</b>
the State of New Mexico.<p>

<p>

The New Mexico Seed Law was enacted in 1978.  We include in our seed law, agriculture seed and vegetable seed. 
The duties of our department are: 1) to sample; inspect; make analysis of, and test agriculture and vegetable seed
transported, sold, or offered or exposed for sale within the state for sowing purposes, at such time and place and
to such extent as may be deemed necessary to determine whether said agriculture or vegetable seed are in
compliance with provisions of this act, and to notify promptly the person who transported, sold, offered or exposed
the seed for sale.  2) to prescribe and to adopt rules and regulation governing the method of sampling, inspecting,
analyzing, testing and examining agriculture and vegetable seed and the tolerances to be followed in the
administration of this act; and 3) to prescribe and after public hearing following due public notice, establish, add to
or subtract therefrom by regulations, a prohibited or restricted noxious weed list; and 4) to prescribe and after public
hearing, following due public notice, to adopt rules and regulation establishing reasonable standards of germination
for vegetable seed.<p>

<p>

The New Mexico Department of Agriculture is not planning any changes to our seed law in 1994/1995.<p>

<u><b>SAMPLING OF LARGE SEED CONTAINERS</u></b><p>

<p>

During the past year the sampling of seed from large seed containers has been a subject of attention among a
number of seed control officials.  More companies are moving from packaging in traditional bags to systems that
will carry much larger volumes of seed.  As this trend continues, sampling methods which insure a reliable sample
need to be developed.  John Flood, an inspector for the Division of Regulatory Services of the University of
Kentucky, obtained samples of wheat this fall utilizing different sampling methods in order to assemble data which
could be studied.<p>

<p>

The data obtained from this sampling is charted.  Four sets of samples were obtained, each set being taken from
the same containers using different sampling probes.  The samples were obtained using a 5/8 x 36 sleeved probe
and a 1 3/8 x 51 sleeved grain probe.  The probes used were not of the compartment type, but rather were open
the length of the probe to allow the contents to flow freely from the end of the probe.  On one set of samples, an
additional probe was used in addition to the two described.  This probe, commonly referred to as the Missouri-D
tube, is a probe which is used to sample bulk fertilizer.  The data for this sampling is presented in the chart shown
on page 6.<p>

<p>

I prefer to offer no conclusions with this data because the sampling involved only a few lots.  The lots sampled were
of good quality and none of the lots sampled were out of tolerance of the guarantees stated by the seedsmen
labeling the lots.  probe length of the 36 inch probe was not sufficient to sample the entire contents of the large bag. 
Sample volumes obtained using the longer, larger diameter probe were much higher.  The use of sleeved probes
which have to be closed dictates that care be exercised because damage to the sample can occur if these probes
are completely closed.  In order to obtain a reliable sampling method for the large containers, data of this nature
has to be assembled.  This data is presented in hope that others will conduct similar studies and we can share our
results.<p>

<center>PRESIDENT'S CORNER</center>
<p>

<center>Updates </center>
<p>

<center>by David F. Svik</center>
<p>

<p>

<b>The End is Near!</b>  It is very difficult for me to believe that two years have almost passed.  This is the last time I will
be providing you with updates and topics of AASCO business.  I have thoroughly enjoyed these past two years as
your "Presidentay" (as Bob Skaggs used to say).  I hope I have served your association well in the fine tradition of
those Presidents before me.  For those of you that will someday be asked to run for an elective office in AASCO,
I encourage you to be a willing candidate when nominated.  You will find that even though it is additional work and
sometimes grief, you will gain much from the experience.<p>

<p>

<b>Upcoming Meetings.</b>  Because the International Seed Testing Assn.  (ISTA) meeting will be held in June this year
in Denmark, meetings such as AOSCA and AOSA are being held on different dates this summer to avoid conflicts. 
Malcolm Sarna will be representing AASCO at the AOSCA meeting which will be held in Colorado on June 5.  I will
be attending the ASTA meeting in Dallas on June 26 and the AOSA meeting on July 9 as the AASCO representative. 
If you have concerns or topics you feel should be brought to these organizations, please con- tact us with your ideas
prior to these meetings.<p>

<b><p>

AASCO Issues!</b>  ISTA will be discussing and voting on an issue at the Denmark meeting which may have long-term
affects on labora- tories, regulatory programs, and AOSA, if passed.  The proposal would amend the ISTA
Constitution to create a non voting membership category for non federal government seed laboratories and
individuals.  This proposal, if passed, would be a major departure from the current philosophy of the one country-one
official lab policy.  If U.S. seed firms were to have to ship internationally using ISTA certificates, requirements for
sampling and testing would change, which would have an impact on our states.  Who would do the sampling for
testing? Would our inspectors now have to be accredited by ISTA?  If so, who would do the accredi- tations and
at what cost to states?  Sampling procedures would change, i.e., sampling would not stop at 30 probes per lot.  There
are a lot of unanswered questions here.  The Federal Seed Lab and Dick Payne, will be casting the U.S. vote on this
issue.  If you wish to know more details, I have a copy of the U.S. position paper.<p>

<p>

The U.S. Seed Health initiative that is being proposed by ASTA is gaining momentum.  A meeting was held in late
March with APHIS officials, ASTA and state Plant Board members.  We have been asked by Dr. Ruth Welliver, a
Plant Board member from Pennsylvania to provide comments from AASCO on this issue.  I have asked Ken
Rauscher to serve as our repre- sentative because of his dual role as a Seed Control Official and Plant Board member. 
We have been informed that a representative of the ASTA group will be attending the Michigan meeting.  He will
be on our program to provide us with more information  on this issue.  <p>

The seed count issue is still on the front burner.  A meeting of the ASTA and National Weights and Measures group
was held in Washington D.C. on April 12, 1995, to discuss problems with labeling and tolerances.  Malcolm Sarna
was present at this meeting and I'm sure he will have a progress report for us at our Michigan meeting.<p>

<p>

<b>Committees - Committees!!</b>  How is your committee doing?  Is it active?  Have you completed your tasks for the
year?  If the answer to these questions is NO, then it's time to get active.  Malcolm will be contacting the
chairpersons to arrange meeting times for each group to get together.  If you are on a committee and have not heard
from the chairperson, give them a call and find out what's happening.  The committees need your ideas!  I hope your
budget will allow everyone to travel to <b>MICHIGAN</b> for this year's meeting in July.  We need your presence and
ideas to remain a viable organization.<p>

<p>

<center>SAY <b><i>YES</i></b> TO MICHIGAN </center>

--and to the 9th Annual Meeting July 23-27, 1995.  I hope your budgets and interest make it possible for you to
attend the meeting this year in Michigan. We have been working hard to put together a very interesting and enjoyable

<u><b>ARKANSAS</u></b><p>

<p>

The Arkansas State Plant Board added barnyardgrass, <u>Bchinochloa crusgali</u>, to the list of noxious weeds in Arkansas,
effective November 1994.  After University researchers presented information on the spread of herbicide resistant
baryardgrass in Arkansas, the Plant Board decided making the weed noxious in Arkansas. They hoped this would
help make the agricultural community aware of the increasing problem of herbicide resistant weeds.<p>

<p>

In a related matter, Arkansas also changed the noxious weed allow- ances in Arkansas Certified rice, soybeans and
wheat to none allowed.  This also was effective in November 1994.<p>

<u><b>SADNESS IN OKLAHOMA</u></b><p>

<p>

On April 19 at 9:00 a.m. our building trembled.  During the next two weeks everyone in Oklahoma City found their
lives shaken.<p>

<p>

It is hard to express the emotions of that day.  The shock of seeing the devastation to the A. P. Murrah and the
surrounding buildings, the excitement of seeing a friend who worked in the Federal building walking down the street
as the cameras pan through the crowd, the tears for friends and loved ones who died or were missing, are only a few
of the emotions we felt.<p>

<p>

Someone said the explosion was supposed to tear this state and nation apart.  However, from what I have seen, it
has been an implosion that has brought this country together.  In Oklahoma City, for weeks after the disaster, 
officials reported a decrease in the crime rate.  As requests for blood and supplies went out--it was hard to believe
the generosity.  Many in our office, minutes after the blast, went to donate blood a few blocks away and found the
lines too long.  They were telling people they would not  get to them that day.  Our office took up a donation and
went to buy needed supplies.   As we were going through Wal Mart someone came up, and in a whisper, asked if
that was for downtown -- and handed us twenty dollars.  Even at the checkout stand the manager came over and
wrote out a discount.<p>

<p>

What a few individuals intended for evil has allowed many to demon- strate the greatest expression of love and
generosity.   Love is greater than hate.<p>

<u><b> TEXAS ACTIVITIES</u></b><p>

There have been two regulation amendments that went into effect in November 1994.  The noxious weed seed list
was amended by reclassifying annual bluegrass, <u>Poa</u> <u>annua</u> from the prohibited category to the restricted category
with no limitation per pound.  Only the name and number must be shown.  The seed continues to be considered
noxious only when found in lawn and turf type seed.  The section pertaining to hybrid labeling was amended, to allow
hybrid cotton seed to be included in the variable 75% to 95% hybrid category.<p>

<p>

All computers in the Seed Quality Program have been recently upgraded.  There have been numerous complaints
involving watermelon, pepper, cucumber and onion diseases.  However, only two of the complaints have been filed
for seed arbitration.  It appears that the trend in our area is to file a seed complaint for any disease problem(s) that
occurs in a production field, otherwise, seed activities have been routine.<p>

<p>

Hopefully, by September 1995 the system will allow communication and transfer of laboratory data between all seed
program offices.  Although we are still in the dark ages, we are happy to be making some progress.<p>

<b><u>KEEPING CANADIAN SEED<p>

GROWERS COMPETITIVE</u></b><p>

<i>How much government involvement does it take to ensure that quality objectives are met?</i><p>

<p>

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is concerned with ensuring the quality of seeds produced and sold in
Canada.  This work is not only crucial to Canada's own food security, but helps to attract buyers from international
markets.  In recent years, fiscal pressures in Canada, as elsewhere, have forced officials to assess exactly what value
their regulatory program adds.  Associate Director of Canada's Seed<p>

 Section, AAFC, Mr. Niels Hansen-Trip says "There's been such an explosion of knowledge and expertise that
governments cannot keep up on their own, but then, neither can industry.  There has to be a partnership with all
players involved."<p>

<p>

Towards this end, the Seed Section is working jointly with the Canadian seed industry on several initiatives for
change.  In a pilot project designed and managed by AAFC, Canadian officials are using the hybrid corn inspection
program to look at what it takes to satisfy the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
standards, and how total quality management systems can benefit both regulators and service users.<p>

<p>

The impetus for closer scrutiny of the OECD's <i>official</i> inspection requirements springs from two sources: the success
of some seed growers in the Netherlands, and Canadian industry's concern about keeping its competitive edge.  Jim
McCullagh, Chief of the Seed Section's International Unit, explains that for some years now, Dutch seed growers
have carried out their own quality checks to ensure that seed produced in the Netherlands meets government
requirements.  These companies, along with a number of Canadian and multinational seed companies with established
quality management systems, questioned whether or not it makes sense to pay for government monitoring and
inspection services when their own rigorous standards more than satisfy OECD requirements.<p>

<p>

The OECD, faced with the same fiscal pressures that many countries are experiencing, is considering the risks and
benefits of private inspection programs.  They did not make a decision on whether a national agency - Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada, for example - may delegate the authority to inspect and approve seeds to non-government
interests.  This is where the Department's 1994 pilot project comes in.<p>

<p>

Involving a number of seed corn growers, who currently conduct <i>unofficial</i> inspections of their own, its purpose was
to examine what advantages and pitfalls there might be for government and industry in a system of delegated
responsibility for official inspection.  To start with, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada invited some of industry's
experienced field supervisors to take part in the federal inspector training program.  Upon completion of the course
the inspector was eligible to participate in the pilot project.  The project, called a "temporary experiment" in Europe,
was run in tandem with AAFC's regular inspection program.  The Department monitored seed corn fields inspected
by private inspectors, and compared, analyzed and assessed their reports against those of the government inspectors. 
The training program for government inspectors was adjusted to focus more on the skills inspectors need to solve -
rather than merely find - problems when they audit companies that meet the Department's "total quality management"
specifications.  For its own part, industry is looking carefully to see whether it is worth the extra costs involved (for
training its own inspectors and insuring against related liabilities) to have more control over the timing of seed
certification.<p>

<p>

The results from the 1994 pilot project were evaluated and modifications to the program will be implemented for
1995.  The major change will come from the incorporation of ISO guides that pertain to inspection activities and third
party product certification.  These general principles will be used to establish standards for both parties - the regulator
and the companies using private inspectors.  These standards will clearly identify what is expected of each party in
the delivery of crop inspection.<p>

<p>

As government and industry gain more experience in this area, Canada will be better placed to assess the potential
benefits and drawbacks of delegating the inspection function.  If successful, the model will be used in other areas of
regulation in the seed industry.  And, as Jim McCullagh says, "If the OECD decides that 'official inspections' can
indeed be delegated, we'll have things up and running.  This will help to give Canadian seed growers a competitive
edge."<p>

<u><b>IOWA SEED NEWS</b></u><p>

<p>

This year we looked at an abnormally small amount of seed.  This was due to personnel and time shortages.  The
personnel problems will be solved by next seed season, but I don't know how to add extra time to the year.<p>

<p>

A bill was introduced to regulate the seeds of native prairie plants.  At present, seeds of prairie plants are not
considered agricultural seeds nor vegetable seeds.  Those are the only seeds regulated by the state.  The seeds of
native prairie plants are more in demand each year.  However, the bill to regulate these seeds never made it out of
committee.<p>

<p>

Plant Health Testing - All our seed inspectors and entomologists now have a copy of the "Handbook for Seed
Inspectors" published by AASCO.  The entomologists and I do a lot of seed sampling for disease testing for export
of seed.  Many countries require freedom from specific disease.  For example, all of the countries of the European
Union require corn seed to be free from Stewart's wilt.  They accept a field inspection or laboratory test.  Samples
must be "officially drawn" by a government inspector and tested in an approved lab.  Many companies are not sure
what seed they want to send until shortly before the new growing season, so the Iowa State Lab does a lot of seed
testing.  Although most of the seed sampled by our office and tested for diseases is corn seed, a lot of soybean seed
and other seed is sampled and tested.<p>

<p>

The number of countries requiring field inspections or seed health testing has grown over the last few years.  This
number should continue to grow as new countries are formed and older countries start looking toward protecting
their agriculture.  Unfortunately, not all the requirements are based on biology. Politics drive many decisions.  Some
decisions are retaliatory for something our country has done.  Some probably are based on someone trying to protect
their job;<p>

and others could be based on ignorance or misinformation.  Since both industry and the government are pushing
exports, seed health testing and the associated work should continue to increase.<p>

<b><u>REGULATING ''HERBICIDE-TOLERANT" VARIETIES  -- DISCUSSED AT RECENT SEMINAR IN
ILLINOIS</b></u><p>

<p>

A two-day special seminar was held in Champaign, Illinois on May 9  and 10, and was well attended by seed control
officials, official seed analysts, and the seed trade.  This meeting was originally organized at the request of the Illinois
Crop Improvement Association in Champaign.  The intention was to invite seed control officials  to see greenhouse
testing facilities and growout testing procedures that Illinois Crop Improvement Association is offering as a testing
service to the industry and state agencies. Control Officials representing the States of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, and Wisconsin met on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday
morning to hear and participate in discussion on topics as: "Herbicide Tolerant Testing Procedures," "Centralized
Testing Concept for Herbicide Tolerant Varieties," "The Chemical Industry Viewpoint on Herbicide Tolerant
Claims," and the "Seed Industry Viewpoint on Marketing and Evaluating Herbicide Tolerant Varieties of Corn,
Soybeans, and Cotton."<p>

<p>

The Tuesday afternoon opening session was hosted by the Illinois Crop Improvement Association at their greenhouse
facilities.  A tour of the facilities was provided and overviews of their testing protocols were explained. 
Representatives from Monsanto and the University of Illinois made presentations concerning  their involvement and
concerns with these new types of seed products.  Illinois Crop Improvement has established a service testing program
to evaluate herbicide tolerant claims and they provided explanations of their program and the services they offer. 
A price list for tests they offer can be obtained from them at the present time.<p>

<p>

The Wednesday morning session included presentations on "Label Claims for Herbicide Tolerant Varieties,"
"Laboratory Test Procedures to Determine Herbicide Tolerance," and "Impact on the Market"- discussions
concerning what's currently being marketed and the potential of such a market for herbicide tolerant varieties.  Open
discussion was held on these topics and information and concerns were shared on the aspect of how much regulatory
agencies should be involved in monitoring and regulating these new types of products in the marketplace.<p>

<p>

Major concerns from those control officials in attendance included:  having "recognized" test procedures that could
be standardized; should the industry (seed and chemical) assist in providing effective testing protocols for such new
products prior to the introduction of those products in the market; lack of "quantitative" claims with the present
labeling (something that could be measured); and should AASCO develop labeling criteria for herbicide tolerant
varieties?  Concerns of the seed and chemical industries included: "farmer-saved seed" and attempts to control the
use of such for such varieties; accreditation of test procedures to evaluate varieties and claims; and having a third
party involved in evaluating/verifying characteristics of new products.<p>

<p>

Good open discussion during the two- day meeting helped to make us more aware of what's coming with these new
seed products.  Participation from the seed industry, seed certification, and those control officials and their laboratory
staff helped to make this an interesting and informative "first" meeting to discuss herbicide tolerant seed varieties. 
We look forward to continuing these discussions at our annual meeting in July, in Michigan.  Sincere thanks are
extended to Jim Shearl, Illinois Crop Improvement Association manager, and Mark Ringler of the Illinois Department
of Agriculture for their assistance in planning this seminar.<p>

<u><b>CLAIMS FOR GENETIC TOLERANCE TO PESTICIDES AND PESTS</b></u><p>

<i>And how to regulate the claims for that tolerance</i><p>

<p>

The special meeting at Champaign, Illinois concerned claims for genetic tolerance to pesticides and pests and how
to regulate these claims.  The Recommended Uniform State Seed Law (RUSSL) does not have labeling and
advertisement, Section 3.(a)(2) and (3).  Such claims will be made and should be allowed on seed considering the
value of that information to the crop producer.<p>

<p>

A number of good questions were raised but three seemed to lead to more questions.  One of those was the
development of methods for verifying the claims.  Ken Rauscher asked if the firm making the claim should be
expected to provide a method for verifying that claim.  Claims for a particular benefit might involve considerably
different scrutiny than claims for a different benefit.  Such a requirement is written into the Federal Food and Drug
Act, and it is said to work reasonably well.  One difference exists however, in that the claim for the drug is also
approved by the governmental agency.  It would seem that methods for verifying claims would need to go through
an approval process, or the claim maker would be subjected to various scrutinies from different states.  Some seed
purchasers and control officials would read more into a claim than others.  These thoughts lead to considerable time
and cost in developing methods for verifying whatever claim a seed labeler might choose to make; and that leads to
wondering if the regulation of tolerance claims is feasible.  <p>

<p>

Another concern was the quan- tification of tolerance claims.  Most claims have simply stated that the genetic entity
is resistant or tolerant to a specific disease.  Resistance or tolerance is taken to be in comparison to other existing
varieties or brands.  The claim is implied but not quantified.  Defensive postures are often voiced to the effect that
we do not want claims to be too specific because of the trouble it can get the trade into from liability suits.  There
is another side to this however, which limits the development of the industry to the specifications that are available
for use.  Good labeling and regulation are dependent on a precise assessment of the information provided.<p>

<p>

A third concern was tolerance or resistance claims on <u>brands</u>.  With more of the new varieties being sold as brands
and the reason for developing the variety being to incorporate a genetic alteration, the sellers will certainly want to
promote the benefit of that alteration.  Claims could be verified for brands as well as for varieties, but since the
genetic identity of brands is not known to anyone other than the labeler, who is to say whether the tolerance claim
is true for any lot other than the one tested.  If truth-in-labeling is to be assured, such claims will have to be denied
for anything other than a defined variety.<p>

<p>

All three concerns become much less important if the regulation of the tolerance claims is judged to be beyond the
practical capability of government service.  Many products are sold without a disinterested party overview, but none
are sold where there are both regulation and no regulation of information on the same label.  Gary Arthur suggested
at the meeting that the regulated information be put on the seed tag and the non regulated information be put on the
bag.  Seed laws are based on the seller providing specific information that is considered to be useful and truthful. 
A distinction between what is truthful (or regulated) could be noted on the seed label and bag to try to eliminate the
confusion.  I am sure most of the seed trade would choose a different word than <i>"truthful"</i> if they supported making
this distinction.<p>

<u><b>SEED CONTROL OFFICIALS AND THE PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION ACT AS<p>

AMENDED</b></u><p>

<p>

Amending the Plant Protection Act (PVPA) was necessary for several reasons: to include closer alinment with the
requirements of UPOV; clarify the producer's right to save and sell seed (known as the farmer exemption); and make
the PVPA more in line with laws protecting Intellectual Property Rights and others.  While all are valid reasons to
amend PVPA, I am concerned about the disparity it will create, and the unbelievable difficult task of enforcing the
state seed laws.  Note that I said "will," because I am convinced that for whatever reason, a majority of the farmers
who purchase PVPA varieties still do not or choose not to understand the requirements of the 1970 version of
PVPA, and for Seed Control Officials the amendments will make the situation worse.<p>

<p>

To begin with, the PVPA is complex legislature, extremely hard to read and understand when compared to state seed
laws or the Federal Seed Act (FSA).  With no reflection upon the public educators, they found   it difficult to discuss
PVPA in open meetings on a voluntary basis, and many times they formed the wrong conclusion with disastrous
results.  Since the educators did not understand the requirements, and the producers did not want to, it is no wonder
that "brown bagging" became a common practice.  Seed Control Officials can take as much credit for educating the
producers as any other group.  Now, we must face the producers and explain that a revision of PVPA has taken place
on <u>April 4, 1995</u>.  Just getting the producer to recognize that the rule that applied prior to April 4, 1995, is not the
same as the rules of today will be a monumental task.  Even though that seed protected after April 4, 1995, will be
appropriately labeled, how will we ever convince the purchaser of the importance of not only reading the label, but
to comprehend the information?<p>

<p>

So, what is the problem?  It is my understanding that every state has  a signed Memorandum of Understanding for
the enforcement of the Federal Seed Act.  Even though you may not have amended your state seed law to include
any provisions of Title V, under the cooperative agreement, you still have the responsibility to enforce Title V.  To
enforce Title V, we are now obligated to explain to the producers that if you are producing a variety protected before
April 4, 1995, you can save only enough seed to plant your expected acreage for the coming year.  However, should
you change your mind and plant another crop or sell your farm, then you could sell the seed you saved.  Since he will
continue to question that, you can explain that the new variety he just planted was protected after April 4, 1995, and
while he can continue to save enough seed to plant his holdings, there is no provision to sell the first bag without the
owners permission.  Oh yes, don't forget there are exemptions to include alfalfa, clover (I assume all kinds), lawn,
turf and forage grass seed -- which can be sold as "Variety not stated."<p>

<p>

For me, I thought that minor surgery and a "band-aid" would have restored the PVP to good health.  However, with
major surgery, and much mending tape, we now have created a monster with many heads for Seed Control Officials. 
Will there be confusion?  I think it has already begun.  There are already varieties on the market that apparently
protection has been delayed until after April 4.  These are labeled <i>"Plant Protection Contemplated,"</i> which I
understand is used in lieu of "Plant Protection Applied For."  What happens if these are never protected for whatever
reason?  What if these are Title V Varieties, and the seed is marketed before they gain Title V status?  Does that
mean that we could have seed of the same variety being marketed for both Title V and non-Title V?<p>

<p>

In spite of what I have said, I still support amendments to PVPA, as it alone will continue to sustain the public plant
breeding programs in Virginia by collecting a royalty from public released varieties that we need, in addition to
varieties from private plant breeders. But, somehow or other couldn't the final product of PVPA be a little simpler?<p>

<p>

<b>Greetings</b> to all my seed control colleagues!  I want to start out by acknowledging the contributions of two of our
members, beginning with Dave Svik, our immediate past president.  Dave did an outstanding job guiding our
organization during the past two years, representing us at allied organization meetings and even before a
Congressional committee.  Well done Dave!  Special recognition is also due Ken Rauscher.  He was the perfect host
for our meeting in East Lansing.  Those of you who weren't there missed a great one.  Many thanks to Ken and his
fine staff.<p>

By now, each of you should have received a list of committee assignments.  Most of the accomplishments of AASCO
are the result of our committee activities.  This is an opportunity for those who are unable to attend annual meetings
to still have a chance to play a part in the work of AASCO.  Even if you are not a member of a certain committee,
don't hesitate to give your input to the committee members.  My special thanks go to those of you who agreed to
chair our various committees.<p>

<p>

In September I represented AASCO at the NASDA meeting in Portland, Oregon.  As many of you know, Oregon
has a very diverse agriculture of which they are justifiably proud and very actively support and promote.  Not
unexpectedly, the Farm Bill was a major topic of discussion.  We also heard presentations on
agriculture trade in the 21st century and agricultural research. <p>

<p>

AOSA President Debbie Meyer has appointed Dr. Richard Payne of the Federal Seed Laboratory
to chair a seed count committee, the purpose of which is to develop guidelines for conducting seed
count tests.  I will be serving on this committee as will other public and private seed laboratory
personnel, members of the seed industry and researchers.  The committee will also be keeping in contact with weights
and measures officials.  Hopefully the efforts of this committee will assist in resolving some of the seed count
concerns which have been discussed at our last two annual meetings.<p>

<p>

I have also learned that a rule proposal concerning germination tests conducted on file samples is being submitted
to the AOSA Rules Committee for consideration.  If adopted, the rule would provide that file samples more than six
months old should not be considered a source of seeds for germination for the purpose of updating the seed lot label. 
As we all know, the conditions under which a seed lot is stored may be significantly different than those under which
the sample is stored.  What do you think?  You may want to share your thoughts on this with your seed laboratory
manager.<p>

<p>

I'm sure the year ahead of us will be an interesting one.  The important thing is that we all communicate.  Please let
me hear from you on items you feel AASCO should be dealing with.<p>

<p>

<b><u>WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WISCONSIN? </b></u><p>

The Wisconsin seed control official was alerted by a county agricultural agent of an advertisement for "Canada
Green" lawn seed identified as a "hybrid" and making other outlandish claims.  Recognizing the address on the ad
was of Pennsylvania origin, a call was made to the Pennsylvania seed control official, Joe Garvey.  He took
immediate action calling a conference with the company and sending the ad with his concerns to the USDA Seed
Regulatory and Testing Branch.  It is my understanding the company will be working with Pennsylvania Department
of Agriculture to revise the ad so claims are more accurate and realistic.  Research data is being sought to
substantiate some of the claims.<p>

Joe did indicate the information on the label was accurate.  It is a mixture with a pure seed composition of 46%
creeping red fescue, 25% annual ryegrass and 24% Kentucky blue grass.  The supplier was from Roxboro, Quebec.<p>

The ad was of national distribution appearing in "Parade" magazine and states targeted for videos and individual
mailings.  The ad was in the "Parade" August 13, '95 issue, p. 18.  <p>

By the time you receive this news the lawn seeding season will be over for us in the temperate zone.  But you may
be interested as we look at the coming spring.<p>

In the February Newsletter, it was indicated that the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade &amp; C. P. was
sending out a bid for contracting seed testing for the fiscal year July 1, '95 through June 30, '96 with the option of
two one-year renewals.  We are pleased to report the Nebraska Dept. of Agriculture was the successful bidder.  Dave
Svik and I are working on procedures to resolve a few bugs in the system.  The major kink has been adapting the
computer program to the data on the forms.  Winter grain and lawn seed samples are testing the system -- so far, so
good!<p>

<u><b>NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR THE STATE OF UTAH</u></b><p>

In Utah we are working diligently to become part of the computer age.  We are traveling on the electronic
information highway at a rapid speed.  It is a goal of our department, and the rest of the state to use the newest and
most improved systems of computer technology available.  Within a few months we will have computers installed
in all of our field offices.<p>

Our inspectors that are located throughout the state will be able to prepare all kinds of information and reports, or
receive the same from the main office in Salt Lake City, through the internet system.  The internet system currently
connects us with many other state and federal offices, i.e., USU Extension, Forest Service, BLM, National Parks etc. 
Eventually we will be connected with the major businesses involved in the agriculture industry.<p>

Fax machines were the newest innovative equipment that we used.  Seed lab reports or other information could be
quickly faxed to our seed inspection offices throughout the state, or to seed businesses in a flash.  No longer was it
necessary to rely on mail delivery.  Now, although the fax is still very handy and useful, the computer has taken over
and become one of the most important tools we use.  E-mail has almost replaced the fax machine. <p>

During the past year we have developed new seed lab reports that are generated on the computer.  The time saved
in typing the old reports, and the ease with which the new reports are prepared is amazing.  Errors in report
preparation are practically eliminated, or are easily corrected.  The computer does most of the work with input from
the secretary.  Annual reports and other summaries of the work can be prepared much easier than before.<p>

It seems that the only thing left to do is to perfect the TRANSPORTER so we can travel in the method of Captain
Kirk. The TRANS- PORTER would certainly save the travel budget and allow us to attend more conferences and
workshops.  <i>"Beam me up Scotty."</i><p>

<u><b>TEXAS REPORT</u></b><p>

The Seed Quality Division lost two of its valued employees at the end of August, due to retirement.  <p>

John Metcalf wanted to become a fishing guide and Jodie Keilberg wanted to become a cowboy.  We wish them well
in their new careers.  As a result, we have reorganized the division, Fred Woodward is now the Deputy Director for
Seed Quality.  He will assume the responsibilities for seed law as well as certification.  Please give Fred a call if you
need assistance.<p>

During the fiscal year, we will be reviewing all of our seed law regulations and determining what, if any, sections
need to be repealed, replaced, or amended.  All sections that are not repealed, amended, or reaffirmed by August 31,
1996, will expire.  Looks like it's going to be a busy year for us.<p>

<u><b>NEWS FROM NEBRASKA</u></b><p>

Nebraska Agriculture struggled through one of its more rocky growing seasons in 1995.  The wet spring caused
farmers headaches as crops were not planted until very late in May and into June.  Then we got hit with hot dry
weather during the summer which stressed dryland crops but did speed the development of the corn and other crops
to maturity.  The final blow was the extensive freeze over the state in early September which basically ended the
growing season about three weeks too soon.  Initial reports of up to 400 million dollars in potential loss in the value
of all crops were reported.  However, that estimate has been lowered somewhat as the crops are being harvested. 
Some crops were hurt bad, some not so bad depending on the area of the state, the amount of moisture received and
planting dates of the crops.<p>

Without a doubt, germination on seed corn will be affected as much of the seed crop was still in the field.  Soybean
germinations will also be affected as much of the seed we have received so far have immature green beans mixed in. 
Most of the native grass seed crop was lost to the freeze and I have been told that supplies of native grass seed will
be tight due to very little carryover.  The good news was that Nebraska had one of it's best wheat crops in a while.<p>

As of July 1, 1995, our seed laboratory has been providing the testing services under a contract with the Wisconsin
Department of Agriculture's seed regulatory program.  We had a very smooth transition thanks to the efforts of our
computer program analyst and look forward to an interesting and challenging three years as we provide seed tests
for Bill Brener's regulatory program.<p>

The seed lab will continue to provide support to our bureau feed program in the wild bird food area by providing
examinations for noxious weed seed.  We are also providing support to our weed division by providing TZ tests on
prohibited noxious weed seed to determine viability for counties in court cases and various spraying programs.<p>

In PVP news, we issued our first hearing notice to a firm for sales of protected varieties of wheat in violation of the
Nebraska seed law which requires that the seed can be sold only if the variety was certified.  The firm was charged
because they violated a prior agreement made with us that they would cease all sales of seed by variety name.  The
administrative hearing will be held in late October.<p>

NEW PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION COMMISSIONER</b></u><p>

Dr. Kenneth Evens recently retired as commissioner of the PVP Office.  Dr. Marsha A. Stanton has been named the
new commissioner.  In making the announcement Agricultural Marketing Service Science Division Director William
J. Franks, Jr. pointed out Dr. Stanton's ". . . extensive experience with the PVP Act . . . " and her ". . .<p>

strong professional and academic background with regard to plant breeding and genetic resources."  Dr. Stanton has
served as a consultant representing the American Society of Agronomy, the Crop Science Society of America, the
Soil Science Society of America, and the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.  Dr. Stanton was a major
participant in amending the PVP Act to conform with the 1991 convention of the International Union for the
Protection of New Varieties of Plants.  She received her Ph.D. degree from the University of Arkansas.<p>

<b><u>NORTH DAKOTA REPORT</u></b><p>

Scab once again raised its ugly head in North Dakota in 1995, though not as high as the two previous years.  The
scab levels in wheat and barley are lower than in 1993 and 1994, but will still somewhat affect seed quality.  Overall
grain crop quality and quantity were slightly below average.  Row crops are still being harvested, but generally look
good.<p>

The affect of the 1994 amendments of the PVPA is a big topic of discussion throughout our state's seed industry. 
One of the big questions is the extent of liability for the seed conditioner who knowingly or unknowingly processes
unauthorized seed of a protected variety.<p>

We as seed regulators have a huge task in front of us for not only enforcing the changes in PVPA, but to inform
producers and the industry of how the changes affect them.<p>

One of the things that concern me as the person responsible for seed regulation is the role that the industry expects
of us as regulators in the enforcement of PVP.  I sometimes get the feeling that the industry looks to the agency
responsible for seed regulation to protect their financial interest in their varieties.  I am not entirely comfortable with
that assumption.  I feel that our primary function is to monitor seed labeling and how seed is offered to the public. 
Most of us, by statute, are also charged with overseeing PVP, but I wonder if maybe the extent of our involvement
should only be limited to determining whether or not a PVP violation has occurred, and let the owners protect their
financial interest.  Do other states struggle with this perception?  I would like to hear some feedback and comments,
or opinions.<p>

<b><u>THE KENTUCKY SEED PROGRAM OVERVIEW</b></u><p>

The administration of the Kentucky seed law is the responsibility of the Division of Regulatory Services, a part of
the University of Kentucky, college of agriculture.  The division also has responsibility for the administration of the
Kentucky feed, fertilizer, and creamery license laws.<p>

Our field inspection duties are performed by nine inspectors, each assigned to a specific work area.  Each inspector
performs duties in the areas of seed, feed, and fertilizer.  An additional inspector performs the duties of the creamery
license law statewide.  Each program is administered by a program coordinator.<p>

The division maintains a seed laboratory for testing regulatory samples and service samples.  The laboratory is staffed
with three purity analysts, two germination analysts, and a seed testing coordinator.  A staff assistant is shared by
seed testing and seed regulatory. Laboratory tests per- formed include purity, germination, noxious weeds, all states
noxious, moisture, seed count, hypocotyl color, accelerated aging, tetrazolium, phenol (wheat), peroxidase
(soybean), cold test, test weight, treated seed germination, and endophyte.<p>

Seedsmen shipping seed in Kentucky are required to obtain an annual permit to label seed, submit a quarterly report
of sales, and pay an inspection fee based on the units sold.  The annual permit fee is twenty-five dollars.  All
Kentucky seed dealers and non-certified seed conditioners are required to register and pay a registration fee of
twenty-five dollars.<p>

The seed certification program in Kentucky is the responsibility of the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association. 
The association establishes the seed quality standards for Kentucky certified seed, performs the field inspection
duties, and approves the plants where Kentucky certified seed is processed.  Certified seed from other states
distributed in Kentucky must meet the standards established for Kentucky certified seed.  Fees for participation in
the certified seed process in Kentucky are paid to the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association.<p>

In Kentucky seed regulatory actions include non-compliance notices, stop-sale orders, regulatory hearings, and court
proceedings through local or state jurisdiction.  The most common regulatory action is the stop-sale order.  These
orders are issued from our office and also by our field inspection staff.  Stop-sale orders issued from our office are
usually the result of a seed lot which our laboratory has found to be out of tolerance of the seed label guarantees. 
Our field staff issues stop-sale orders on site for seed lots which are observed to be out of compliance with our seed
law requirements.  Our office has issued 370 stop-sale orders and our field staff has issued 185 stop-sale orders
through the month of October of the current year.<p>

During 1994, our laboratory tested 2,409 regulatory samples and 5,909 service samples.  The 1994 regulatory
samples had an overall deficiency rate of 14.07%.  Our field inspection staff has obtained 2,842 regulatory samples
through October of the current year.  Our laboratory has also received 3,164 samples for service tests.  This current
year will be a record year for regulatory samples in Kentucky.  A very large planting of fall wheat has contributed
to the increase in regulatory samples.<p>

The purpose of our seed program in Kentucky is the same as all other states -- our laws and regulations are written
to assure the consumers that the label guarantees are correct.  A consumer is not only the person who purchases a
bag of seed at the retail outlet, but it is also the seedsman who purchases on a wholesale basis from both in-state and
out-of-state sources.  Our seed program protects and benefits both parties.<p>

<b><u>NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM IN WEST VIRGINIA</b></u><p>

The West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Regulatory Protection Division is undergoing substantial changes in
our computer programming.  We are in the process of moving away from a DOS Operating System to a Windows
System, utilizing <i>Access</i> as our software base.  Changing to the <i>Access</i> program will allow us to manage and analyze
our seed registration, laboratory, and market data in a more effective way.  For example, we plan on using the
uniqueness of Product Bar Codes (when available) as a key means in which to track retail products by
company/manufacturer in our registration process.<p>

This new innovative approach in data management will provide more time to maximize on the regulatory duties of
inspection, laboratory and compliance staff, and enable us to better serve the public and those we regulate.<p>

The West Virginia Department of Agriculture is reviewing the WVDA State Seed Law for future revision.  News
on possible revisions and a time frame will be sent to the appropriate committees and organizations upon completion.<p>

<p>

<b><u>COMPUTERIZED TOLERANCES</u></b><p>

At the 1995 AOSA National Convention, Mr. Crispin Rendon demonstrated a computer program on tolerances.  He
has developed a computer program which works with both the AOSA and Federal Seed Act tolerances.  I am sure
that many seed control officials are not aware of his work which could be very useful.<p>

Mr. Rendon is an Associate Biologist with the California Department of Food and Agriculture.  He works with the
Pest Exclusion and Seed Services Division and has a special interest in computer programming.  I am including this
article in the AASCO Newsletter to inform other seed control officials of his work that did not make it to the AOSA
convention.  Any further inquiries should be made directly with Mr. Rendon at his office phone number which is 909-782-4190 or FAX which is 909-782-4187.<p>

<b>Happy New Year from snowy Maryland!</b>  Those of you who are used to having over 30 inches of snow dumped
on you, in a few days time, I'm sure are having fun watching us try to deal with all this white stuff.  While we are told
that what happened on January 7th and 8th was technically not a blizzard, they sure could have fooled us.  It will be
interesting to see what the rest of the winter has to offer.<p>

<p>

Dennis Brown reports that the <i>Certification Issues Study Committee</i> will soon have their report completed, which
he will then circulate to each of you.  Once you have reviewed it, please share your observations with Chuck Dale. 
Chuck, as our delegate to the Association of Official Seed Certifying    Agencies      Advisory <p>

<p>

Board, will be attending their winter meeting on February 16th.  He plans to share the results of this study with them. 
Since there will not be an opportunity for us to take any formal positions prior to that meeting, it is important that
we each share our thoughts with Chuck so he can reflect the views of seed control officials.<p>

<p>

Those of us who represent AASCO at other organization's meetings need your input.  Chuck would welcome any
items you feel should be brought before the AOSCA Advisory Board.  I plan to attend the NASDA mid-winter
meeting and I'd like to know of any concerns or issues that would better prepare me for that meeting.<p>

<p>

I trust all our committees are up and running!  It's surprising how fast July comes!  If you haven't already done so,
please take a look at your committee duties and responsibili- ties and get the ball rolling.<p>

<p>

Steve Burningham, chairman of the <i> Meeting Place Committee</i>, recently sent out a memo soliciting meeting hosts
for 1998.  Since our 1995, 1996, and 1997 meetings will all have been east of the Mississippi, Steve is hopeful that
the 1998 meeting will be out west.  Please consider taking your turn.<p>

<p>

Dr. Larry Copeland of Michigan State University recently submitted a proposal for a study of seed sampling methods. 
You may recall that we appropriated money for this purpose several years ago, but have not been successful in
finding someone to undertake this study.  Our reactivated <i>Sampling Research Committee</i>, under the leadership of
Larry Nees, is currently reviewing Dr. Copeland's proposal and will make recommendations to the Executive Board.<p>

<p>

For those of you wondering what became of the task force to study labeling needs generated by new technology, I
haven't forgotten!  As required by the resolution passed at <p>

our  meeting  last  summer,  I  have contacted other organizations asking them to provide members for this task
force.  If any of you would like to serve on this task force -- please let me know.<p>

<p>

Finally, if changes to your state seed law or regulations are under consideration, please consider submitting them to
the <i>Labeling and Legislative Review Committee</i>.  The committee will review your pro- posals for conformity with
RUSSL and perhaps offer other helpful suggestions.  <p>

<b>NORTH CAROLINA NEWS</b><p>

The trend in a number of states is for the "release" of seed lines to private companies who then market them under
brand names for product identification rather than as varieties.  North Carolina law has traditionally prohibited this
practice by requiring seed products sold with a brand name or designation to be labeled with variety name or names
on the seed analysis label.<p>

<p>

During the 1995 session of the North Carolina legislature, the seed law was amended to enable, by regulation, the
requirement that certain named kinds of seed be sold only by variety name.  The provision prohibits the use of
"variety not stated" labeling on those designated kinds.<p>

<p>

On December 7, 1995, the North Carolina Board of Agriculture passed a regulation which will require that the
variety name be stated on the seed analysis label for the following kinds of seed:<p>

COTTON, FIELD CORN, PEANUTS, SOYBEANS, TOBACCO, WHEAT<p>

The proposed effective date is February 1, 1996.<p>

<b>PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE GEORGIA SEED LAW</b><p>

A proposed revision to the Georgia Seed law has been prepared for legislative consideration early in 1996 by the
Georgia General Assembly.  The proposed revisions are a comprehensive update of the law consistent with current
industry standards, other state and federal seed laws and the Recommended Uniform State Seed law (RUSSL).  The
proposed draft has been reviewed by the AASCO <i>Labeling and Legislative Review Committee</i>, the ASTA, the
Georgia Seedsmen's Association and the Georgia Crop Improvement Association.  The Georgia seed law was last
revised in 1956.<p>

<b>NEW KID ON THE BLOCK</b><p>

On August 1, 1995, the Arizona Dept. of Agriculture had a new kid on the block.  Kathleen Willey<p>

became the seed and hay program manager for the state.  This is a new position and  program for the
department.  <p>

<p>

Kathleen comes into the position with 16 years experience in seed analysis, 8 years in private industry,
and 8 years in public service.  An Iowa native, she grew up on the family farm which produced corn
and soybeans.  From there she went on to graduate from Iowa State University with a degree in
Botany.<p>

<p>

The seed industry in Arizona is as diverse as the state itself.  With everything from citrus, to dates, to vegetables, to
cereals, to turf, and yes, cactus too -- regulation and enforcement is challenging at best.  But this is a challenge
Kathleen is looking forward to taking on and developing into a strong program for Arizona.<p>

   <b>PENNSYLVANIA CO-HOST TO WORKSHOP</b><p>

The Northeast Seed Analysts Workshop (NESAW) was co-hosted by New York State Seed Laboratory and the
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture at Harrisburg, PA on November 2 and 3, 1995.<p>

<p>

Approximately 30 people attended from nine state and federal agencies.  Ellen Chirco from the New York seed lab
arranged the program and conducted the meeting.  Joe Garvey  was responsible for making the local arrangements.<p>

<p>

The 50% hands-on training to satisfy the AOSA training certificate requirement consisted of crop seed ID's requiring
both common and scientific name, apiaceae spp. seed ID, ryegrass fluorescence calcula- tions and grass seed mixture
purity tolerance calculations led by Malcolm Sarna.<p>

<p>

Rodney Young explained the AOSA rule changes which were effective October 1, 1995; changes in the Federal Seed
Act, interaction between APHIS and the Federal Seed Act.  Other topics discussed were exercises using the
Handbook #25 referee distributed by the California State Laboratory, how to label crownvetch germination as
discussed in "Items of Interest" Spring, 1994.  A referee will be conducted on crownvetch in an attempt to break
dormancy of swollen seed.  This referee will be discussed at the NESAW in the fall of 1996 which will be held at
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania again and co-hosted with the New York State Laboratory.<p>

<b>CALIFORNIA</b><p>

It appears that after six years law and regulation changes; the mandatory mediation of seed complaints will become
a reality in California.  The proposed regula- tions underwent extensive revision in 1995.  In addition, supporting
legislation was passed in 1995.  The regulations will become effective March 1996.  The good news is that <p>

<p>

California will adopt the "arbitration/conciliation/ mediation" notice language found in the Recommended Uniform
State Seed Law (RUSSL).  The notice will be required on all agricultural and vegetable seed sold at retail for
nonfarm use.<p>

<p>

There are other changes to the California Seed Law that will take effect in 1996.  The role and the authority of seed-certifying agencies has been clarified at the request of the seed industry and the California Crop Improvement
Association.  The labeling requirements for the "viability assurance statement" has been limited to agricultural and
vegetable seed sold at retail for non- farm use.  Copies of the California Seed Law and Seed Inspection Regulations
are available upon request.<p>

<p>

In 1996 California will be updating the language and structure of its regulations for seed inspection to reflect changes
made in the Federal Seed Act and to address local issues.  It is hoped that this revision will take effect sometime in
1997.<p>

<b>SAMPLING RESEARCH  COMMITTEE UPDATE<p>

</b>This relatively "new" committee formed by past president Svik in 1994 has been busy reviewing and considering a
research proposal submitted by Dr. Larry Copeland of Michigan State University to evaluate sampling equipment
used by member states.  The Association has been looking at establishing such a study since 1989, and money has
been pledged by the Regional Associations along with AASCO to partially fund a project.<p>

<p>

Dr. Copeland has put together a written proposal with outlined objectives to be able to evaluate sample probes and
triers.  His main objectives of the study are as follows:<p>

1.      Which of the many types of probes used by official seed enforcement agencies in the United States and Canada
provide the most representative samples for different kinds of seeds.<p>

<p>

2.      What criteria or performance standards should be required for sampling equipment?<p>

<p>

As a member of the <i>Seed Inspectors Qualifications and Training Committee, </i> I was involved in two separate surveys
that were circulated back in 1987 and 1989 to try to gain a feel for the variability in sampling equipment that was
being used across the U.S. and Canada.  We found that AASCO members were using a wide variety of sample probes
and tools to sample the same products from state to state and country to country.  This variability causes a great deal
of concern about "representative" samples that may or may not result from the use of such equipment.  Dr. Copeland
is eager to get involved in a study to properly evaluate this equipment to deter- mine which design is most effective.<p>

<p>

We would like to begin making a collection of sampling probes from AASCO members so that Dr. Copeland can
determine how many pieces of equipment will be involved in his study.  These probes would be given to him on a
temporary, short-term basis and would be returned at the end of the study.  If you would be willing to donate a
sample probe that your state is currently using, please contact Dr. Larry Copeland and arrange to ship him the
equipment at the following address:<p>

<b>ILLINOIS SEED ARBITRATION ACT</b><p>

Last year in a ruling handed down by an Illinois court, the Seed Arbitration Act was found to be limiting due process. 
The judge presiding over the case ruled that the 30-day limit of notification by the user to the Department was too
narrow in its time perimeters.  In his comments, the judge found that a person may not be aware of a problem or have
sufficient time to request arbitration during the harvest period which may exceed the 30-day notification required.<p>

<p>

The Illinois Dept. of  Agriculture has drafted an amendment to the present law that would expand the window of time
for requesting arbitration.  The proposed change is as follows:  <p>

<p>

"Except in case of seed that has not been planted, the claim shall be filed within a time
that will permit effective inspection of the plants under field conditions and in no case
later than 30 <u>90</u> days after completion of harvest."<p>

<p>

Hopefully this change will meet the time required for "due process" while allowing a timely and thorough
investigation of all pertinent information.<p>

<b>PVPA EFFORTS IN KENTUCKY<p>

</b>Efforts to inform Kentucky  seeds- men and producers of the changes in PVPA are currently underway.  The PVPA,
the Federal Seed Act, the amended Kentucky Seed Law and the recent supreme court decision which defined a
farmer's right to save seed were topics which received considerable attention during a joint meeting of the Kentucky
Seedsmen association and the Kentucky Seed Improvement Association.<p>

<p>

The Division of Regulatory Services has been involved in this effort since early last year, however I continue to hear
the all too familiar "I didn't know I couldn't do that."  A very recent mailing to 70 seed processors by certified mail
contained: <p>

<p>

copies of a laminated PVPA information poster <p>

copies of our seed law and regulation <p>

a complete listing of protected varieties of soybeans and wheat <p>

a seed conditioner record form<p>

a chart detailing what can and cannot be done with custom conditioned seed based on protection status<p>

and a declaration form for custom conditioned seed  <p>

In addition to the certified mailing, two seed conditioner workshops have been scheduled at the end of February. 
Our seed improvement association has made attendance of one of these workshops mandatory for its approved
processors.  The PVPA will be one of the main topics at these workshops.<p>

<p>

The role we all play as state regulatory officials in the enforcement of the PVPA is one which places many demands
upon our resources.  In Kentucky, many seed kinds which are not covered by the PVPA are also widely used.  Seed
which does have plant variety protection is either Title V U.S. Protected or U.S. Protected.  In the case of Title V
seed, all of us have the option of submitting these violations to USDA, however this is not an option for seed with
Title V protection.  In Kentucky, when a violation is noted in this category of seed which involves an infringement
on the rights of the variety owner, the owner is contacted and provided with documentation of the infringement.  The
variety owner has the right to pursue an infringement proceeding.  The Plant Variety Protection Act gives the
certificate holder this right.  Owners of seed in this category must be willing to take action to protect their rights if
the purpose of the act is to be realized.  The willingness of variety owners to take action will become even more
important with the introduction of seed varieties which have been genetically altered.<p>

<p>

The goal of the Plant Variety Protection Act can be realized through a cooperative effort between the seed industry,
state and federal seed control officials, and individuals involved in seed production.  As control officials, we must
first assure that seed producers and the seed industry  have a clear understanding of seed laws.  We must then take
the action required to discourage those who are going to violate those laws.  A part of this action is providing variety
owners with information in regard to noted infringements.  The owners of  PVP certificates must then be willing to
pursue the rights  which the PVPA affords them.<p>

<b>IT JUST DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY</b><p>

As Bill Brener reported in the November AASCO Newsletter , the "CanadaGreen" ad was too good to be true, and
it was!  Since Virginia some how or other gets involved in most controversial matters, this one is no exception.  So
Bill, forgive me for writing on your coattail.<p>

<p>

As most of you know, the "CanadaGreen" lawn and turf mix- ture was packed in Canada by Garden Seed, Roxboro,
Quebec, who shipped it to The Kline Group, Roanoke, Virginia.  Kline provided the warehouse space, personnel for
packing, and Tri-Star Products, Laureldale, PA or Parsippany, NJ  was supplying the inventory and payroll.  It has
proved to be a bit of an embarrassment to Virginia for the seed to be shipped from our state, but on the other hand
we did have the opportunity to try and correct the problem with help from many of you.<p>

<p>

The  day     after     receiving     the<p>

first inquiry as to, What is "CanadaGreen"?, Malcolm called to say they received an order and it was shipped from
Roanoke.  We immediately visited the Kline Group and placed under "Stop Sale, Use, or Removal Order" 8,000 -
4 lb. containers, all were of Lot #035781.  We collected one container for a sample.  Our seed laboratory determined
the lot was contaminated with 99.84 /lb. of Quackgrass, a prohibited noxious weed seed, 456.48 /lb of Annual
bluegrass and 399.36 /lb of <u>Poa</u> <u>trivialis</u>.  Annual bluegrass and <u>Poa</u> <u>trivialis</u> are Restricted Noxious Weed seed in
lawn and turf seed in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.  Because it contained Quackgrass, which is
a noxious weed seed under the Federal Seed Act (FSA), APHIS became inter- ested -- particularly since it was not
sampled when it entered the U.S.<p>

<p>

Since the shipment was found to contain Quackgrass in excess of that permitted for entry into the U.S., APHIS took
charge of the lot and it was denied entry.  On November 13, 1995, an APHIS inspector and one from our Department
witnessed the loading of the seed on two trailers, after which they were sealed for return to Canada.  The APHIS
inspector gave each truck driver specific instructions that they should make known to the Canadian authorities at
Alexandria Bay border crossing the content of their cargo.  Later, we received information from the Canadian shipper
that the seed was returned.  However, this is not the end of the story!<p>

<p>

<p>

During the two months the seed was held under "STOP SALE" at Roanoke, many, many things took place.  The
FSA office became involved and Tri-Star received a warning about their advertisement.  Joe Garvey met with some
of the Tri-Star officials early on.  Several of us requested copies of any future advertisement before it was to appear
in print, but promises were all we received.  The ad which appears with this article is from a direct mailer <u>SmartNews</u>
<u>Shopper</u>, head- quarters unknown, but bulk mailing permit was from Bensenville, Illinois.  This ad is only a slight
improvement of the original ad and still contains 13 statements which Virginia considers to be false and misleading. 
I have repeatedly advised Tri-Star and their attorney that if they wanted to avoid further controversies with the ad
they should work with AASCO, but to no avail.  What is most disturbing is the companies involved (Garden Seeds,
Tri-Star) have been less than cooperative.  They supply nothing requested or nothing that is useful or only a small
amount of that requested.  After repeated requests, we have yet to receive a laboratory report for the seed.<p>

<p>

Garden Seed sent two containers of Lot #626655 to Virginia and Maryland for testing as replacement for Lot
#035781.  Both Virginia and Maryland found both containers to be within testing tolerance of the label or easily
relabeled.  An individual from Maryland placed an order and for that received, the lot number showing was #626655;
however, when the outside label was removed the one underneath was -- you guessed it -- Lot #035781.  The
company will not respond to any inquires about the shipment and this occurred while the seed was under "STOP
SALE."  So there was more to the lot than what was in Roanoke, but we have not learned where.<p>

<p>

What is the latest?  Well, the latest is that the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business
Bureau, New York, New York reviewed the ad and made a bad situation worse.  They, more or less, agreed with
Tri-Star that with a few modifications of the statements, they would be truthful and substantiated.  In defense of the
statements used in the ad, the advertiser used excerpts from the descriptions of the three kinds included in the mixture
as justification for the statements.  <p>

<p>

<i><u>Example</u>:  The inclusion of annual ryegrass is because it is "cool season," "germinates rapidly," and "quick to
establish."  For the purchaser in Virginia and many other states the most important descriptive terms of annual
ryegrass is "<u>short lived</u>," "<u>light green color</u>," "<u>competitive</u>," "<u>bunch-type grass</u>," and is "<u>considered poor among
turfgrass for heat and low temperatures</u>."  All of these terms were used in the same reference to describe annual
ryegrass, but they chose to use only the <b>"friendly"</b> terms to justify the statements.  And so it goes.  I am sure we
have not heard the last of this one!<p>

<b>ON A PERSONAL NOTE </i>  </b><p>

This will be my last contribution to the Newsletter, and while I do not want to leave with a controversial matter still
unsettled, it appears I will.  Retirement is March 1, 1996.  Consequently, I suggest that you work through Malcolm
and USDA for a final agreement of the ad.  <p>

<p>

To all of this I say -- AASCO is in good hands.  Good bye, Good Luck and Godspeed.<p>

I am writing this article on my one day in the office between the AOSA/AOSCA/SCST meetings in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin and the ASTA meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona.  Needless to say, it is a busy time for me, but more
importantly, a busy time in seed circles.  Much is happening and much is being talked about.  However trite it may
sound, change is going on!  Much of it is necessary and much of it is desirable.  But during times of change mistakes
can easily be made.  While many progressive ideas will be adopted, we may also learn the hard way that some of the
old "tried and true" ways of doing things were done that way for a good reason.  The challenge will separate the
good ideas from the bad.  This is not going to be easy, but all of us must participate.  More than ever before,
communication between our organization, the seed trade, seed consumers, our affiliate organi- zations and among
ourselves is vital if we are to understand what's happening and be players in these changes.  A good place to start
is our upcoming meeting in New Orleans.  Program Chairman Jim Warren has crafted an exciting agenda of timely
topics.  Be there!<p>

<p>

The AOSA/AOSCA/SCST meetings were busy.  The Wisconsin Crop Improvement Association did an outstanding
job in hosting these meetings.  This was the first time all three organizations have met together.  It was difficult to
be involved in all the different meetings.  Due to my AOSA responsibilities, I didn't have much time to attend the
AOSCA meetings.  Fortunately Chuck Dale, our AOSCA Advisory Committee delegate, was at that meeting, while
Dick Lawson was available to represent us at the AOSA Committee of Affiliates meeting.  My thanks to both of
these men.  All three of us will be reporting to you in New Orleans.  <p>

<p>

Congratulations to Ken Rauscher who was recently named an honorary member of the Michigan Crop Improvement
Assn.  Ken was cited for forging an excellent relationship between the Michigan Dept. of Agriculture and Michigan
certified seed producers.  He was also recently promoted to the position of Director of the Pesticide and Plant Pest
Management Div.  of MDA.  Congratulations are also due Dick Lawson who was just elected vice president of
AOSA.<p>

<p>

Larry Nees has agreed to chair our task force on labeling needs generated by new technology.  Other AASCO
members will be Bill Brener and Mark Ringler.  Two important positions are about to become vacant in AASCO,
both the result of some of our stalwart members being assigned new responsibilities in their respective departments. 
Ken Rauscher has notified me of his need to step down as Treasurer, while Joe Hardy will be resigning as RUSSL
Review Committee chairman.  We owe both men a real vote of thanks for all the time they have given to these
demanding tasks.<p>

<p>

Finally, Steve Burningham and the other members of the Meeting Place Committee are working on sites for our
future meetings. We'll be meeting in Lexington, Kentucky in 1997 but the years after that are still open.  If your state
has not hosted a meeting in recent years, please give it some thought.  <p>

<p>

See you in New Orleans!<p>

<b>ANNUAL MEETING</b> --<b>NEW ORLEANS </b><p>

Remember!  The annual meeting this year will be July 13-18, 1996 in  New Orleans, Louisiana -- city of parades and
that wonderful southern hospitality.  The hotel site will be the Omni Royal Orleans.  Contact Eric Gates, Louisiana
Dept. of Agriculture &amp; Forestry for details.  His telephone number is 504-925-4733.<p>

<p>

<b>ARKANSAS</b><p>

The Arkansas State Plant Board Seed Division has had a busy year with regulation changes, setting up databases for
our new computer system, and the addition of new Plant Board inspectors and inspector supervisors and seed
tonnage auditors.<p>

<p>

Pending regulation changes and/or additions include a matrix of civil penalties for violators of seed laws and
regulations that will go before a public hearing in June.  This should give the Plant Board a better tool for uniformity
in dealing with violators and allow the Board to impose fines rather than being limited to canceling or restricting a
company's license.  We have also been active in working with a seed industry committee to establish regulations
allowing for bulk certification of blue-tag certified wheat and the use of "superbags" as approved con- tainers for
blue-tag grade wheat.  In addition to this, reports of other states finding Tropical Soda Apple in seed samples
prompted us to propose this weed as prohibited noxious in Arkansas.  Both of these proposed changes will also go
before a public hearing in June.<p>

<p>

We have spent a great amount of time this year setting up databases for seed division work and training staff on their
use.  The seed certification information that we already had on computer transferred to the new system, however all
the forms, indexes, etc. had to be rebuilt.  Doing this, along with establishing databases for the non-certified service
and regulatory programs, has been rewarding but time consuming.  We are now able to respond much more quickly
on requests for information on indivi- dual samples as well as more general reports such as germination averages on
individual varieties.<p>

<p>

The Plant Board is organized into five divisions with most of the inspection staff serving all divisions.  In the past
10-12 months, nine inspectors have been added, including four inspector supervisors that are coordinating activities
between the office and field.  Most of these new inspectors are still in the training process.  In addition to this, the
Plant Board Grain Warehouse Auditors have been trained to conduct seed tonnage audits and are currently
conducing some audits for the seed division.<p>

<p>

Hopefully, most of these changes in regulations, data processing and inspection staff is just the foundation for more
improvements for our agency.  We seem to have more plans that we have time for, but "inch by inch, everything's
a cinch!"<p>

<b>IOWA</b><p>

Seed companies are using other parts of the world for winter nurseries.  More production seed is coming from these
same areas as well as research and parent increase seed.  The primary areas are Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico. 
There is a greater chance of introduction of some new pests now than a few years ago.  USDA tries to intercept the
pests coming in with the seed, but they will not catch everything.  Many diseases will not be visible on the seed. 
Your department should work with the seed companies in your state on the potential problems.  The companies
should know what is in their fields in these countries.  It would be a good idea to talk to representatives of the
companies about   the   problems they see in their fields.<p>

<p>

All the states are different.  In Iowa we are the regulatory seed lab and the office concerned with phyto- sanitary
regulations.  It is a good idea for you to talk to the office in your state that handles phytosanitary work to find out
which companies grow seed overseas.  You really want to know about companies that have production overseas. 
They may bring large quantities of seed into the U.S.  Even though USDA checks for weed seeds and insects, they
are not necessarily looking for problems of concern to your state.<p>

<p>

If you know when a company is bringing in a large quantity of seed from overseas, you could have an inspector
sample the seed when it reaches its destination.  Most companies will be very happy to comply.  They don't want to
be known as the company that introduced a problem to the U.S. or to one of the states.<p>

<p>

For example, Iowa has never had head smut of corn become established in the state.  Head smut occurs in Chile and
in parts of the U.S., like Texas.  It's been found three times in Iowa.  Each time the company involved (not the same
company three times) plowed the field under and made sure corn was not planted there the next year.  In one case
the company paid the farmer to plant alfalfa and leave it for a three-year period.  Over the years I've talked to various
company representatives about not being the company known for introducing head smut into Iowa.  Now I get
informed if anything new is found, and invited to see the problem and the control of the problem.<p>

<b>HAWAII</b><p>

The Hawaii Dept.  of Agriculture's   seed control programs, although  modest in comparison to other states,
continued under blue skies and record breaking heat.  Four stop sale orders were issued for various labeling violations
thus far in Fiscal 1996.  Over 90 seed lots have been tested for germination.  Our seed certification program has seen
a significant increase in requests for seed corn certification.  We have received over 150 applications thus far, making
1996 the busiest year since the inception of the certi- fication program in the 1970's.  According to a seed company
official, the trend will continue, with seed companies expanding their operations in the islands.  There has been no
sign of maize chlorotic mottle virus, which plagued the seed corn growers on the island of Kauai in 1989 and 1990. 
Although it is unknown whether the virus has been eradicated, credit must go to the seed companies for adhering
to an annual 60 day corn-free fallow period to keep virus levels down.<p>

<p>

Under title III of the Federal Seed Act and other regulations, which is administered in cooperation with APHIS-PPQ,
several foreign vegetable and agricultural seed lots were refused entry.  Although millet seed contaminants were the
primary cause of rejections, one agricultural seed lot from Australia was found to be contaminated with <u><i>Orobanche</u></i>
sp., a parasitic weed.  Currently, <u><i>Orobanche</i></u> is not known to occur in Hawaii.<p>

<b>MONTANA</b><p>

The Montana Department of Agriculture, under the authority of the Montana Seed Law establishes the fees for the
analysis of seed samples to be tested at the Montana seed lab located on the campus of Montana State University
in Bozeman, MT.  New fees were sought by the lab in 1995 so that the schedule more closely reflects the costs of
running the program.  The fees were pro- posed to the various agriculture groups and received general support. 
Through the rule make process, the new schedule became effective in January, 1996.<p>

<p>

Due to funding challenges, the field activities of the Department have been somewhat limited.  Activities are centered
around complaints coming from industry and being more focused on potential violations.  Pending the resolve of
funding issues, routine duties such as inspection of seed conditioning facilities, seed label reviews and sampling will
be increased.  This past fall saw the conclusion of a case in which the largest civil penalty ever administered under
the Montana seed law was levied and paid the Department.<p>

PENNSYLVANIA</b><p>

The spring season has been unseasonably cool and wet.  Seed has been moving fairly well, however.  The largest
problem in seed control has been the unbelievable amount of outrageous advertisements.  Ads that claim that their
product will be the answer to all homeowners lawn problems.  What makes controlling these ads so difficult, is the
products are most often mail order and not located in the state.  Most consumers should adhere to the old adage "that
if it sounds too good to be true, it is."<p>

MINNESOTA <p>

</b><u>Seed Law Change</u><p>

The Minnesota Seed Law was amended in the 1996 session of our legislature and the amendment was signed in law
on April 2, 1996.  the amendment reads as follows:<p>

<p>

<i>Minnesota Statues, section 21.901.<p>

BRAND NAME REGISTRATION.  The owner or originator of a variety of nonhybrid seed that is sold in this state must annually register
the variety with the commissioner if the variety is to be sold only under a brand name.  The registration must include the brand name and
the variety of seed.  The brand name for a blend or mixture need not be registered. The fee is $15 for each variety registered for sale by
brand name.<p>

</i><p>

<u>Strategies for Winning Compliance in Truthful Seed Labeling</u><p>

We tried something different two years ago in an attempt to obtain compliance from a small seed company located
in Minnesota.  We were in the final stages of bringing a case against the company to trial for numerous and
continuing violations of the seed law.  The company, after finally realizing the seriousness of their situation, decided
they would make some changes in their operation.  They came to us and asked what they could do to get back into
compliance and stay there in the future.  We agreed to a series of meetings aimed at developing a detailed compliance
agreement.  The agreement would contain specific steps they would take to change their operation.  We agreed to
review all their labels prior to printing and to show them how to begin a check sample system for all purchased
product, to make sure the labeling was accurate.  We also agreed to make unannounced inspection visits on a
periodic basis and obtain official samples to check on their progress.  We are happy to report that the company has
virtually turned their business around.  The violation rate on samples obtained of their products has dropped to near
zero and they are now a profitable and growing business.  We will be gradually decreasing our sur- veillance because
we feel it is no longer needed at the current level.  As an additional benefit manage- ment from the company gave
a presentation to our inspectors outlining how the process worked and promoting it as a positive way of regulating. 
Our inspectors reacted very favorably to this since it is rare they receive positive feedback from clientele.  From our
perspective, it has been a win-win situation.  It also cost us and them a lot less than prosecution would have.  We
intend to use this option more often but only when conditions warrant it.<p>

<p>

We are also currently looking at another method of increasing com- pliance.  It all started when one of our staff
attended a training session entitled "Managing Beyond Bureaucracy."  As an exercise, some of the individuals
involved decided to develop a strategy for increasing compliance with the seed law in Minnesota.  To do this they
contacted a small local garden center and a major seed company for their ideas in this matter.  We received an eleven
page report from this group and that is much too long to reprint in this newsletter.  the report is very interesting and
I thought you might be interested in at least a few of their ideas, they are as follows:<p>

<p>

1.	A more aggressive and compre- hensive program of education is needed for all stakeholders.<p>

<p>

2.	Measurement and evaluation of outcomes should be done to strengthen or adjust the compliance strategies used.<p>

<p>

3.	Consumers need to be more discerning in the purchasing habits.  Education on reading labels is needed.<p>

<p>

4.	Market forces should play a larger role in enforcing and achieving compliance.<p>

<p>

The report gave suggestions for some innovative ways of accom-plishing the four items listed above.  I will be
distributing copies of the report to NCSSCOA members at our meeting in New Orleans.  If anyone not in that group
wants a copy, please contact me.<p>

<u><p>

Is It Summer Anywhere Yet?</u><p>

We have had  one of the   coldest (if not  <u>the</u> coldest) springs on  record, following a   winter that  saw heavy snow
accumulations.  The result is a spring planting season that is at least three weeks late and in some cases has not
arrived yet.  Our prime wheat, potato, barley, and sugar beet producing region has been hit the hardest.  It is likely
that many farmers in this area will not be able to harvest a crop this year.  They are understandably frustrated.  The
high grain prices will not do them any good if they have nothing to sell.<p>

<b>PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION ADVISORY BOARD MEETING</b><p>

The Plant Variety Protection (PVP) Advisory Board met March 27-28, 1996 at the National Agricultural Library
Building in Beltsville, MD.<p>

<p>

December, 1995, marked the 25th anniversary of the Plant Variety Protection Act, and was celebrated with    an  
 anniversary     party  on  March 27.  In attendance were all the former commissioners, as well as Dr. Marsha Station,
the commissioner since September, 1995.<p>

<p>

Shirley Watkins, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, gave opening remarks at the
board meeting on March 28.  Commissioner Stanton gave a progress report on the activities of the PVP office and
an update on their strategic plan.  Work on publication of the revised PVP Act and the Regulations and Rules of
Practice is in progress currently under legal review.  It will be made available on their world wide web, as well as the
soybean crop database.  Plans are to include wheat and corn databases this summer.  Availability of this data will
allow applicants to make some prelim- inary searches to find possible variety conflicts.  <p>

<p>

Results of a PVP Customer Satisfaction Survey were discussed, particularly ways to shorten the turnaround time for
processing PVP applications.  A report was also given by the PVP Advisory Board subcommittee, appointed to
evaluate several issues relating to the protection of hybrids and parental lines under the PVPA as amended in 1994.<p>

<p>

The next meeting of the PVP Advisory Board was tentatively set for March, 1997.<p>

<b>KARNAL BUNT DISEASE IN WHEAT</b><p>

Most of you are by now familiar with Karnal bunt, the disease that threatens the export of U.S. wheat.  <i>Bunt</i> means
a destructive covered smut of wheat, and smut means a matter that blackens, such as coal dust.  The name <i>Karnal</i>
comes from the name of the town in India near where the disease was first found.  the disease is actually a fungus
<u>Tilletia</u> <u>indica</u> which can survive in the soil, but may also be carried by the seed.  Affected grain is discolored, has
a pungent fishy odor and lower palatability.  Flour made from the affected grain has an unpleasant taste but there is
no toxicity associated with the infection.  Generally, wheat con- taining more than 3% bunted kernels is considered
unfit for human consumption.*<p>

<p>

Because of the effects of Karnal bunt on grain quality and the fact that it is a seed-borne disease, most countries have
imposed restrictions on the importation of wheat from areas having infections.  Twenty-two countries are known
to regulate or prohibit grain movements on the basis of Karnal bunt.  That is of particular concern considering that
over fifty percent** of the U.S. wheat produced is being exported and that constitutes 3.3 percent*** of the U.S.
balance of payments.<p>

<p>

Special emphasis has been given to regulating the disease for reasons, in addition, to the lack of acceptance by other
countries.  Its distribution in the U.S. is still limited.  Known infections included Arizona, and areas in New Mexico,
Texas and California where infected seed was shipped for planting.  Secretary of Agriculture Glickman signed a
<i>"Declaration of Emergency" </i> authorizing the transfer and use of funds to conduct a program to identify, control and
eradicate Karnal bunt.  All wheat-producing states' departments of agriculture are participating in the survey.  <p>

<p>

The disease has not spread exceptionally rapid since it has been known to occur in India since 1931 and Mexico since
the early seventies.<p>

<p>

One reason for bringing the subject up for discussion is to consider the potential for using seed regulatory inspection
samples to survey for this disease and others.  Seed control officials or seed laboratory super- visors have a cost-free
survey mechanism resource through the responsibilities of their present jobs.  If the seed samples collected represent
what seed is being offered for sale, the survey should be an unbiased representation of what actually exists.  There
would be costs involved in observing lots for the diseases but that could be managed by the respective administrator. 
In some cases, it might be practical to train seed analysts to look for the plant pest, if it could be put off until a time
in the season when seed regulatory responsibilities declined. Regula- tory responsibilities are normally given to state
officials administering plant laws.  Those administrations have the authority to place quar- antines on plants carrying
pests, but many are quite limited in their ability to survey the extent of the problem.<p>

<p>

Another advantage of surveys through seed regulation might be the authority granted in seed laws to draw samples
without having to spread the fear of what action might be necessary if pests are found.<p>

<p>

There is also some potential to use the state-collected seed samples for other purposes.  It is probable that surveys
performed by seed breeders are less representative of actual conditions that those which could be performed using
the seed collected by departments of agriculture.  The seed collected for seed regulation would be produced under
conditions similar to the common practices of fertility and pest control.  In addition, information from the state
collection of samples could be made available to whoever needs the information or for whatever research project

Some other information is given below on the disease that might be of interest:<p>

<p>

The disease is a floral disease which may infect all species of Triticum (common wheat, durham, emmer and spelt) and Triticale.  Infected plants
appear to show symptoms only on the kernels and heads.  Normally, only a few random seeds per head are attacked, not the entire head.  The
fungus is usually confined to the embryo end of the kernel so discoloration develops only at the end or along the crease of the kernel.  The
disease is not easily detected in the field since most infections are not heavy enough to cause noticeably smutty masses, and the glues are not
noticeable distorted.  Confirmation   of   the   presence   of    the<p>

disease is normally done by washing infected grains of the crop, screening off larger particles, separating the spores by centrifugation at 200
g and identifying the spores at 100X magnification.<p>

within the state for seeding and sowing purposes, at such time and place and to such extent
as he may deem necessary to determine whether said agricultural or vegetable seeds are in
compliance with provisions of this chapter, and to notify the distributor of any violations.<p>

	2.      To prescribe, and after public hearing following due public notice, to adopt rules and
regulations governing methods of sampling, inspecting, analyzing, testing, and examining
agricultural and vegetable seed, tolerances to be followed in the administration of this
chapter, and such other rules and regulations as may be necessary to secure the efficient
enforcement to this chapter.<p>

	3.      To prescribe and, after public hearing following due public notice, establish, add to, or
subtract therefrom by regulation prohibited and restricted noxious weed lists.<p>

	4.      To prescribe and, after public hearing following due public notice, to adopt rules and
regulations establishing reasonable standards of germination for vegetable seeds.<p>

	5.      To adopt regulations establishing standards for the effectiveness of legume inoculant applied
to pre-inoculated seed.<p>

	6.      To adopt regulations governing the treatment of seed and the labeling and distribution of
treated seed.<p>

	7.      To publish at least once a year, in such form as he may deem proper, information concerning

time when the conveyor is accessible, for the same purpose.<p>

	2.      To issue and enforce a written or printed "Stop Sale" order to the owner or custodian of any
lot of agricultural or vegetable seed which the state seed commissioner or his agent finds is
in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, which order shall prohibit further sale, processing and movement of such seed,
except on approval of the state seed commissioner, until he has issued a release from the
"Stop Sale" order of such seed: Provided, that in respect to seed which has been denied sale,
processing and movement as set forth in this paragraph, the owner or custodian of such seed
shall have the right to appeal from said order to a court of competent jurisdiction in the
locality in which the seed is found, in compliance with IC-4-22-1, praying for a judgment
as to the justification of such order prohibiting the sale, processing and movement in
accordance with the findings of the court.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed as limiting the right of the state seed commissioner to proceed as authorized by
other sections of this chapter.<p>

	3.      To establish and maintain or make provisions for seed testing facilities, to employ qualified
persons, and to incur such expenses as may be necessary to comply with these provisions.<p>

Sec. 10.  Any lot of agricultural or vegetable seed not in compliance with the provisions of this act
shall be subject to seizure on complaint of the state seed commissioner to a court of competent
jurisdiction in the locality in which the seed is located.  In the event that the court finds the seed to
be in violation of this act and orders the condemnation of said seed, it shall be denatured, processed,
destroyed, relabeled, or otherwise disposed of in compliance with the laws of this state: Provided, that
in no instance shall the court order such disposition of said seed without first having given the
claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for the release of said seed or permission to process or
relabel it or bring it into compliance with this act.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>15-4-1-11  Injunction</b><p>

Sec. 11.  The state seed commissioner is hereby authorized to apply for, and the court to grant a
temporary or permanent injunction to restrain any person from violating or continuing to violate any
of the provisions of this act, or of any rule or regulation promulgated under the provisions of this act,
notwithstanding the existence of other remedies at law.  Whenever such an injunction is granted, no

each twenty-five (25) pound tag or label, twelve cents ($0.12) for each fifty (50) pound tag or label,
eighteen cents ($0.18) for each seventy-five (75) pound tag or label, and twenty-four cents ($0.24)
for each one hundred (100) pound tag or label for alfalfa, clover, vegetable, and grass seeds or
mixtures of any of these; and two and one-fourth cents ($0.0225) for each twenty-five (25) pound
tag or label, four and one-half cents ($0.045) for each fifty (50) pound tag or label, six and three-fourths cents ($0.0675) for each seventy-five (75) pound tag or label, nine cents ($0.09) for each
hundred (100) pound tag or label, and nine cents ($0.09) for one hundred (100) pounds for each tag

successor may return for credit any unused state seed commissioner tags or labels which have become
obsolete.  Credit for the return of such obsolete tags or labels shall be allowed after deducting all
costs of printing and handling.  When a distributor is granted a permit to report the quantity of seed
sold and pay the inspection fee on the basis of this report in lieu of attaching or furnishing state seed
commissioner tags or labels as provided in subsection (d), he may return for credit, within sixty (60)
days after issuance of the permit, all unused state seed commissioner tags or labels whether obsolete
or not.  Those tags or labels submitted as blank will be credited at the purchase price and those that
have been filled out will be credited for their purchase price less the cost of printing and handling.<p>

b) Each distributor of agricultural seed in packages of one (1) pound or less shall pay by January 15
of each year an annual fee of forty-five dollars ($45) for each brand of seed distributed, and such
distributor shall not be required to affix state seed commissioner tags or labels to such packages of
one (1) pound or less which bear a proper label.  However, such payment of an annual fee shall not
be required of retailers who furnish quantities of one (1) pound or less from a properly labeled
container of seed on which the inspection fee has been paid.<p>

<b>15-4-1-14  Business of selling seed under contract to purchase crop; license; bond; suspension
or revocation of license; violations</b><p>

Sec. 14.<p>

a) Any person who is engaged in the business of selling any agricultural or vegetable seed and who
enters into a contract with the purchaser whereby he agrees to repurchase the seed crop produced
by said purchaser at a price in excess of the current market price of the seed at the time of delivery,
is required to secure an annual license from the state seed commissioner to engage in such business;
in order to secure such license, the application for the license shall be accompanied by a bond with
corporate surety, to be approved by the seed commissioner, in the penal sum of ten thousand dollars
($10,000), running to the state, for the use and benefit of any such purchaser of seed who may have
a cause of action against any seller who fails to comply with the terms of the purchase contract.<p>

b) Application for said license shall be made to the state seed commissioner and shall be accompanied
by a fee of one dollar ($1.00) for each place of business from which agricultural or vegetable seeds
are distributed by the licensee, and said license shall expire at the end of the calendar year in which
it is issued.  The state seed commissioner may suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue such license to any
person failing to comply with this chapter.  If hearing is waived by nonappearance of the person at
the time and place designated for the hearing, the state seed commissioner may proceed to act under
this section and suspend, revoke or refuse to issue a license.  The failure to fulfill any contract to
deliver seed sold, or the failure to repurchase the seed crop produced from any agricultural or
vegetable seed sold, shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud the purchaser if the crop
produced by the purchaser meets the requirements as prescribed in the contract of sale.  Whenever
the state seed commissioner has evidence that a licensee has committed fraud on any purchaser, he
shall immediately start proceedings to suspend or revoke the license issued to such licensee.<p>

c) Any applicant for a license may request the state seed commissioner to accept a verified financial
statement of the assets of the applicant in lieu of the submission of a bond; and if the state seed
commissioner, after an examination of the financial statement submitted by the applicant, is of the
opinion that the applicant is finally responsible for any damage that may arise out of a breach of any
such purchase contract, he may accept the statement in lieu of a bond.<p>

d) It is a Class B misdemeanor for a person to enter into a contract with a producer of any 
agricultural or vegetable seed, whereby the person sells seed and agrees to repurchase the seed crop
produced therefrom at a price in excess of the current market price at the time of delivery, unless the
person has a license as prescribed in subsection (a) of this section.<p>

The above vegetable seed germination standards include hard seeds if any are present.<p>

Sec. 8.  Labeling seed as to germination.  The required seed label for agricultural seeds shall not carry
any statement relating to the sum of the percentage of germination and the percentage of hard seeds.<p>

Sec. 9.  Relabeling seed after expiration of germination date.  When agricultural seeds remain in the
inventory of a distributor after the germination test has expired the seed must be removed from sale
or relabeled.  New percentage of germination, hard seeds, and the new date of germination may be
entered on the tags previously attached to the seed only if these items are inserted in such a way as
to be clearly legible and the old percentages of germination, hard seeds and date of germination are
completely obliterated.  In all cases where such changes are necessary, the attachment of new tags
is advised.  State Seed Commissioner tags or labels which become obsolete because of expiration of
the germination date may be returned for credit as provided in Section 13a)IC15-4-1-13a.  The
person upon whose premises the seed is located shall be held responsible for obtaining the new test
and for subsequent relabeling of the seed.<p>

Sec. 10. File samples of seed.  the requirement to keep for one year a file sample of each lot of seed
after final disposition of the lot will be deemed to have been met if a representative sample is
submitted to, or an official sample is obtained by, either the State Seed Commissioner or the Indiana
Crop Improvement Association.<p>

Sec. 11.  Grower's declaration.  A grower's declaration is a statement signed by the grower or shipper
giving, for any lot of seed the lot number, the kind, variety and origin.<p>

Sec. 12.  Labeling of seed distributed to wholesalers.  After seed has been processed, it must be
labeled before distribution to any person, including a wholesaler.  Labeling of seed supplied to a
wholesaler may be by invoice or by an analysis tag attached to the invoice if each bag or other
container is clearly identified by a lot number stencilled on the container or if the seed is in bulk.  Each
bag that is not so identified must carry complete labeling.<p>

Sec. 13.  No inspection fee is to be paid on seed supplied to a wholesaler, one whose predominant
business is to supply other distributors rather than consumers of seed.  Seeds distributed under all
other conditions (except those specifically exempted in IC15-4-1-8) must be completely labeled and
the inspection fee must be paid thereon when distributed.  The inspection fee is not to be paid more
than once on any shipment of seed.  At the end of each quarter the state seed commissioner will issue
a credit to any distributor of seed for the inspection fee paid to his supplier on (1) seed subsequently
sold to a wholesaler, and (2) seed to which he subsequently attached state seed commissioner tags
or labels.  For payment of the annual fee forty-five dollars ($45) on agricultural seeds distributed in
packages of one (1) pound or less, each definitive type shall constitute a brand.  Example: "Sunny
Lawn Seed" and "Shady Lawn Seed" are separate brands.<p>

Sec. 14.  Quantities of agricultural and vegetable seed shall be reported on forms furnished to the
permit holder by the State Seed Commissioner at the end of each calendar quarter.  Quantities shall
be reported according to kind of seed as designated on the report form.<p>

Sec. 15. A disclaimer, nonwarranty, or limited warranty used on any labeling or advertisement shall
not directly or indirectly deny or modify any information required by IC15-4-1 or the regulations
under IC15-4-1.<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 2.  CONTENTS OF THE LABEL</b><p>

Sec. 1.  the label shall contain the required information in any form that is clearly legible and complies
with IC15-4-1-4 for agricultural seed and IC15-4-1-5 for vegetable seed and the regulations under
IC15-4-1.  The information may be on a tag attached securely to the container, or may be printed in
a conspicuous manner on a side or the top of the container.  The label may contain information in
addition to that required by IC15-4-1, except any additional information shall not be misleading.<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 3.  NAME OF KIND AND VARIETY</b><p>

Sec. 1.  The name of a kind and variety of seed and any descriptive terms pertaining thereto shall be
correctly represented in any labeling and advertisement of the seed.<p>

Sec. 2.  The name of each kind of agricultural or vegetable seed is the name associated with one or
more related species or subspecies which singly or collectively are known by one common name,
except that name which has become synonymous through broad general usage may be substituted
therefor, provided the name does not apply to more than one kind and is not misleading.<p>

Sec. 3.  The name of each variety of agricultural or vegetable seed is the name determined in
accordance with the following considerations;<p>

a) The name of a new variety shall be the name given by the originator or discoverer of the variety,
except that in the event the originator or discoverer of a new unnamed variety, at the time seed of the
variety is first introduced into channels of commerce of the United States for sale to the public,
cannot or chooses not to name the variety, the name of the variety shall be the first name under which
the seed is introduced into such commerce.<p>

b) The variety name shall not be misleading.  The same variety name shall not be assigned to more
than one variety of the same kind of seed.<p>

Sec. 4.  The representation of the same kind and variety of seed in any advertisement or labeling shall
be confined to the kind and variety determined in accordance with IC15-4-1-3.  The name shall not
have associated therewith words or terms that create a misleading impression as to the history or
characteristics of the kind and variety.  Descriptive terms and firm names may be used in kind and
variety names provided the descriptive terms or firm names are a part of the name of the kind and
variety of seed.  Examples:  Stringless Green Pod, Detroit Dark Red, Black Seeded Simpson and
Henderson Bush Lima.<p>

Sec. 5.  The terms descriptive of color, shape, size, habit of growth, disease resistance, or other
characteristics of the kind and variety may be associated with the name of the kind and variety
provided it is done in a manner which clearly indicated the descriptive term is not a part of the name
of the kind and variety.  Examples:  Osh-kosh Pepper (yellow), Copenhagen Market (round head)
Cabbage, and Kentucky Wonder pole bean.<p>

Sec. 6.  Terms descriptive of quality and origin and terms descriptive of the basis for representations
made may be associated with the name of the kind and variety of seed; however, the terms shall be
clearly identified as being other than part of the name of the kind and variety.  Examples:  Blue Tab
Gem Barley, Idaho Origin Alfalfa, and Grower's Affidavit of Variety Atlas Sorghum.<p>

Sec. 7.  Terms descriptive of the manner or method of production or conditioning of seed may be
shown.  For example Certified, Registered, Scarified, Treated, and Hulled may be associated with the
name of the kind and variety of seed provided the terms are not misleading.<p>

Sec. 8.<p>

a) Brand names and terms taken from trademarks may be associated with the kind and variety or
mixtures of kinds or varieties or blends of varieties of seed as an indication of source; however, the
terms shall be clearly indicated as being other than part of the name of the kind and variety, mixture
or blend.  Brands may not be used in place of variety names or in any manner in which they may be
interpreted as being a variety name.<p>

b) When both brand and variety names are stated, the terms must be shown in the following order
from left to right or top to bottom:<p>

	1. the brand name;<p>

	2. the word "brand";<p>

	3. the variety name;<p>

	4. the kind name.<p>

c) When a brand name is stated but no variety name, the terms must be shown on the seed label in
the following order from left to right or top to bottom:<p>

	1. the brand name;<p>

	2. the word "brand";<p>

	3. the kind name;<p>

	4. the words "variety not stated."<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 4.  BLEND LABELING AND ADVERTISEMENTS</b><p>

Sec. 1.  A seed mixture consisting of two (2) or more varieties of the same kind may be designated
as a "blend" of seed.  The word "blend" must be included as a part of the name of the blend.  The
variety name of each component of a blend shall be shown on the label along with the percentage by
weight of each component in excess of five percent (5%) and the germination percentage and hard
seed percentage, if applicable, of each component.<p>

The variety designation of each component, the percentage by weight of each component, and the
germination percentage and hard seed percentage, if applicable, of each component may be omitted
if the label states the kind of seed and the words "varieties not stated."  The blend may be represented
by one common pure seed percentage, one germination percentage, and one hard seed percentage,
if applicable, for the blend as a whole.<p>

Sec. 2.  Blends or mixtures may be assigned brand names but not variety names.  The labeling and
advertisements of varietal blends must not create the impression that the seed is a single variety.<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 5.  HYBRID SEED LABELING</b><p>

Sec. 1.  If any kind and variety of seed present in excess of five percent (5%) is "hybrid" seed, it shall
be designated "hybrid" on the label.  The percentage that is hybrid shall be at least ninety-five percent
(95%) of the percentage of pure seed shown unless the percentage of pure seed which is hybrid is
shown separately.  If two (2) or more kinds or varieties are present in excess of five percent (5%),
each that is hybrid shall be designated as hybrid on the label.  Any kind and variety that has pure seed
which is less than ninety-five percent (95%) but more than seventy-five percent hybrid seed as a result
of incompletely controlled pollination in a cross shall be labeled to show the percentage of pure seed
that is hybrid seed.  No one (1) kind or variety of seed may be labeled as hybrid if the pure seed
contains less than seventy-five percent (75%) hybrid seed.  If may be labeled as a mixture or blend.<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 6.  METHODS OF SAMPLING</b><p>

Sec. 1.<p>

a) In order to secure a representative sample, equal portions shall be taken from evenly distributed
parts of the quantity of seed to be sampled.  Access shall be had to all parts of that quantity.  When
more than one trierful of seed is drawn from a bag, different paths shall be followed.  When more than
one handful is taken from a bag, the handfuls shall be taken from well-separated points.<p>

b)1.    For free-flowing seed in bags or bulk, a probe or trier shall be used.<p>

	2.      For small free-flowing seed in bags a probe or trier long enough to sample all portions of
the bag should be used.<p>

c) Non-free flowing seed, such as certain grass seed or uncleaned seed, difficult to sample with a
probe or trier, shall be sampled by thrusting the hand into the bulk and withdrawing representative
portions.  The hand is inserted in an open position and the fingers are held closely together while the
hand is being inserted and the portion withdrawn.<p>

d) As the seed is sampled, each portion shall be examined.  If there appears to be lack of uniformity,
the portions shall not be combined into a composite sample but shall be retained as separate samples
or combined to form individual-container samples to determine such lack of uniformity, as may exist.<p>

e) When the portions appear to be uniform, they shall be combined to form a composite sample.<p>

Sec. 2.  Bulk seeds shall be sampled by inserting a long probe or thrusting the hand into the bulk as
circumstances require in at least seven (7) uniformly distributed parts of the quantity being sampled. 
At least as many trierfuls or handfuls shall be taken as the minimum which would be required for the
same quantity of seed in bags of a size customarily used for such seed..<p>

Sec. 3.<p>

a) For lots of six (6) bags or less, each bag shall be sampled.  A total of a least five (5) trierfuls shall
be taken.<p>

b) For lots of more than six (6) bags, five (5) bags plus at least ten percent (10%) of the number of
bags in the lots shall be sampled.  (Round off numbers with decimals to the nearest whole number,
raising 0.5 to the next whole number).  Regardless of the lot size it is not necessary that more than
thirty (30) bags be sampled.<p>

c) Samples shall be drawn from unopened bags except under circumstances where the identity of the
seed has been preserved.<p>

Sec. 4.  In sampling seed in small containers where it is not practical to sample as required in 360IAC
1-6-3, a portion of one unopened container or one or more entire unopened containers may be taken
to supply a minimum size sample.<p>

<p>

<b>Rule 7.  SCHEDULE OF CHARGES FOR SERVICE TESTS, ANALYSES AND
EXAMINATIONS</b><p>

Sec. 1.  Any person may submit to the seed laboratory of the Seed Commissioner samples of seed for
analysis, test, and examination.  The fees are based on costs of time and materials and are as indicated
in 360IAC 1-7.  There are two (2) tests:  the purity analysis, which includes an Indiana noxious weed
seed examination, and the warm germination test.<p>

The following schedule of charges consists of:<p>

	1.      A complete test, which includes a purity analysis, a noxious weed seed examination and a
warm germination test;<p>

		CHARGE:  ten dollars ($10) for all agricultural and vegetable seeds<p>

	2.      Purity analysis and noxious weed seed examination only;<p>

		CHARGE:  six dollars ($6) for all agricultural and vegetable seeds<p>

	3.      Warm germination test only;<p>

		CHARGE:  six dollars ($6) for all agricultural and vegetable seeds as defined in the act.<p>

Sec. 2.  The charge for seed mixtures in which more than one (1) kind of crop seed is present to the
extent of five percent (5%) or more is the total of:<p>

	1.      Complete test: ten dollars ($10) for the first kind plus five dollars ($5) for each additional
kind in the mixture.<p>

	2.      Purity analysis and noxious weed exam only; six dollars ($6) for the first kind listed plus
three dollars ($3) for each additional kind in the mixture.<p>

	3.      Germination test only: six dollars ($6) for the first kind plus three dollars ($3) for each
additional kind in the mixture.<p>

Sec. 3.  The State Seed Laboratory shall not be obligated to analyze for purity or test for germination
any uncleaned, unprocessed, and other time-consuming sample, or any sample which obviously does
not meet requirements of IC 15-4-1.<p>

Sec. 4.  Any re-examination of a sample to secure information not furnished on the original report,
or any analysis or test to obtain information not specifically required by IC 15-4-1, will be subject to
a charge in proportion to the amount of work required.<p>

Sec. 5.  Samples which do not indicate the test desired will be given a complete test and charged
accordingly.<p>

Sec. 6.  Samples for seed testing submitted to the seed laboratory shall be tested in the order of
receipt and reported accordingly.<p>

<p>

<center>INTRODUCTION</center>
<p>

<p>

	The purpose of this Seedsman's Handbook will be to clarify and simplify questions that many
seedsmen have about the Indiana Seed Law, its Rules and Regulations, and Seed Certification
Rules and Standards, and how they pertain to all areas of labeling and distributing seed in
Indiana.<p>

<p>

	It is hoped this handbook will address the more common labeling problems and questions
experienced by seedsmen in the state, and present the information in layman's terms (brief and
to the point).  As you may agree, laws and regulations sometimes don't seem to address
specific situations, and because of the complex and vague wording, are interpreted in different
ways by different people.<p>

<p>

	Many desires have been expressed to the authors of this handbook to put together a handy
reference that will provide simple, straight-forward answers and explanations in all areas of
seed labeling and distribution in the state.<p>

<p>

	Additional questions or problems not addressed by the topics listed in this handbook should be
directed to:<p>

<center><b>A GUIDE FOR DISTRIBUTION AND LABELING OF SEED IN INDIANA</b></center>
<p>

<p>

	The first Indiana Seed Law was enacted in 1921 for the purpose of assuring adequate
information through fair and consistent labeling.  The current Act as amended September 1,
1986, carries on that purpose and provides the consumer the opportunity to make intelligent
purchases of agricultural and vegetable seeds.  The basic concept of the law is to assure
complete and accurate labeling of seed before any seed is offered for sale or sold for seeding
purposes in the state.<p>

<p>

	The seed law applies to all commonly known agricultural and vegetable seeds marketed in the
state.  Important aspects of the law governing these commodities include:<p>

<p>

	UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF SEEDS - The Indiana Seed Law prohibits the sale of
agricultural and vegetable seeds by anyone if (a) the seed has not been tested for germination
within the stated 9 month test period, (b) the seed carries labeling that is false or misleading in
any manner, (c) the seed contains any prohibited noxious weed seeds, more than 0.25 percent
of restricted noxious weed seeds, or more than 2.5 percent of all weed seeds, (d) the seed is
represented to be "certified seed", "registered seed", or "foundation seed" unless it has been
produced and labeled in accordance with the standards of the Indiana Crop Improvement
Association.<p>

<p>

	GROWER EXEMPTION - The provisions of the law do not apply to seed grown, sold, and
delivered by the producer on his own premises directly to the purchaser.  However, the
provisions do apply to the seed if it is advertised by newspaper, circular, catalog or other
public means.<p>

<p>

	AUTHORITY OF INSPECTION PROGRAM - The duty of Administering the Indiana Seed
Law is vested in the State Seed Commissioner, who maintains the authority to conduct
inspections and to collect samples to determine compliance with the law.<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 1.  REQUIREMENTS FOR SELLING AND DISTRIBUTING SEED IN<p>

<center>INDIANA</b></center>
<p>

<p>

<p>

	Any person or company who wishes to distribute agricultural or vegetable seeds in Indiana
must either (1) purchase from the office of the State Seed Commissioner "Official seed tags"
which are filled out by the seedsman and attached to each container, or (2) apply to the State
Seed Commissioner for a "permit" to use his own labeling and to report the quantity of seed
sold and to pay the inspection fee on the basis of said report in lieu of attaching or furnishing
official state tags.<p>

<p>

	Under option number one, any person or company may purchase official state seed tags in
weight denominations greater than or equal to the size of the container in which the seed is
sold.  The following styles of tags are offered for sale:<p>

<p>

STYLE "A" TAGS (for alfalfas, clovers, vegetables, and grasses)<p>

		100 pound - 24 cents ($0.24)<p>

		 75 pound - 18 cents ($0.18)<p>

		 50 pound - 12 cents ($0.12)<p>

		 25 pound -  6 cents ($0.06)<p>

<p>

STYLE "C" TAGS (for mixtures of alfalfas, clovers, vegetables, and grasses)<p>

		100 pound - 24 cents ($0.24)<p>

		 75 pound - 18 cents ($0.18)<p>

		 50 pound - 12 cents ($0.12)<p>

		 25 pound -  6 cents ($0.06)<p>

<p>

STYLE "B" TAGS (for all other agricultural seeds)<p>

		100 pound - 9 cents ($0.09)<p>

		 75 pound - 6.75 cents ($0.0675)<p>

		 50 pound - 4.5 cents ($0.045)<p>

		 25 pound - 2.25 cents ($0.0225)<p>

<p>

	Under option number two, any person or company may apply for a "permit" to distribute seed
under private label, and to report the quantity of seed sold on a calendar quarter basis, and to
pay the inspection fee on the basis of said reports.  Report forms are furnished automatically at
the end of each calendar quarter for reporting purposes.<p>

<p>

	Any person or company applying for such a permit is issued a permit number which is not
required to be shown on the label.  There is no fee or charge for such permit.  Once a permit
is approved, it is considered permanent unless cancelled by the holder, or by the State Seed
Commissioner if such action is warranted.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

	The following fees are applicable under the permit system:<p>

<p>

	For seeds distributed in packages in excess of 25 pounds and in bulk:<p>

	All alfalfas, clovers, vegetables, and grasses -- 24 cents/100 pounds<p>

	For all other seeds -- 9 cents/100 pounds<p>

	For seeds distributed in packages exceeding one pound and up to and including 25 pounds in
weight:<p>

	All alfalfas, clovers, vegetables, and grasses -- 6 cents/package<p>

	For all other seeds -- 2.25 cents ($0.0225)<p>

	Agricultural seeds sold in packages of one pound or less require an annual registration of
$45.00 per kind and/or brand.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 2.  LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGRICULTURAL SEEDS</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	The Indiana Seed Law considers "labeling" to consist of any labels, and other written, printed,
or graphic representations, in any form, accompanying or associated with any lot of seed
whether in bulk or in containers, and includes any representations on the invoices.  This, of
course, encompasses all information on the analysis label(s) as well as printed information on
the container.  It is important to note such information on the label and container shall not be
conflicting.<p>

<p>

	Under Section 4 of the law, all agricultural seed sold for seeding purposes must be labeled
truthfully with the following information:<p>

<p>

	1)	Commonly accepted name of the kind and variety of each agricultural seed present in excess of
5 percent by weight, in the order of its predominance.  However, the variety designation may
be omitted if the label states the name of the kind and the words "variety not stated".  When
more than one (1) component is required to be named, the word "mixture" or the word
"mixed" shall be shown conspicuously on the label.  A mixture consisting of two (2) or more
varieties of the same kind may be designated as a "blend".<p>

<p>

	2)	Lot number or other lot identification.<p>

<p>

	3)	Origin (State or foreign country where grown) for all seeds except hybrid corn.  If the origin is
unknown, that fact shall be stated.<p>

<p>

	4)	Name and address of the person or company who labeled the seed or who distributed it within
the state.<p>

<p>

	5)	The percentage of "pure seed" by weight, of each seed component in excess of 5 percent.<p>

<p>

<p>

	6)	"Other crop seeds" percentage, representing the presence of all other agricultural or vegetable
seeds.<p>

<p>

	7)	"Inert matter" percentage present.<p>

<p>

	8)	"Weed seed" percentage present.  The law provides for a maximum allowable limit of 2.5
percent of all weed seeds.<p>

<p>

	9)	The name and rate of occurrence per pound of each kind of "restricted noxious weed seed"
present.  The law allows for a maximum allowable limit of 0.25 percent by weight occurrence
of restricted noxious weed seeds.  Any seeds present in amounts less than the maximum limit
must be shown on the label.<p>

<p>

       10)	Germination percentage, exclusive of hard seed.<p>

<p>

       11)	Hard seeds percentage, if present.<p>

<p>

       12)	The calendar month and year the test was completed to determine such percentages.  Such test
shall have been completed within a nine (9) month period, exclusive of the calendar month in
which the test was completed immediately prior to distribution.<p>

<p>

	<b>NOTE:  The germination percentage and hard seed percentage must be shown separately
on the label.  Any such reference to "total germ and hard seed" is not permitted
on the label.</b><p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 3.  LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR VEGETABLE SEEDS</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	Each container of vegetable seed of any size which is distributed within the state shall
have attached to the container or printed on the container a label with the following information:<p>

<p>

	1)	The name of the kind and variety of seed.<p>

<p>

	2)	The name and address of the person who labeled or who distributed the seed.<p>

<p>

	3)	For seeds which have been treated, the same labeling shall be required as for
agricultural seeds.<p>

<p>

	4)	The number of noxious weed seeds per pound of vegetable seed, if any are
present.<p>

<p>

	5)	For seeds which germinate less than the standard last established:<p>

		a)	The percentage of germination, exclusive of hard seed.<p>

		b)	Percentage of hard seed, if present.<p>

		c)	The calendar month and year the test was completed to determine such
percentages.<p>

		d)	The words "Below Standard" in not less than 8-point type.<p>

<p>

	Vegetable seeds sold in pre-packaged packets must be labeled with the above label
information printed on each individual packet.  Vegetable seeds sold in bulk form must also be
labeled with the appropriate information attached to the bulk container in a conspicuous manner.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 4.  SEED LABEL FORMATS</b><p>

<p>

	The Indiana Seed Law does not restrict the labeler to any specific label format for the
required label information.  However, the rules and regulations under the law do place some
restrictions on how such information must be shown, in that any "abbreviations or contractions
of required terms is not permitted.  In addition, the omission of any required terms is not
permitted.  This would apply to situations involving, for example, seed which did not contain
any "other crop seeds" or "weed seeds" to be labeled with such categories listed as having "0.00
percent"."<p>

<p>

	A recommended label format for agricultural seeds showing a suggested order of label
components is as follows:<p>

<p>

<p>

LOT NO. ______  ___________________________________________________<p>

<b>SECTION 5.  NAMING VARIETIES</b><p>

<p>

	All agricultural and vegetable varieties may have "only one" legally recognized name,
and that name must be used by anyone who represents the variety in labeling and advertising.<p>

<p>

	The responsibility for naming new varieties is given to the originator or discoverer of a
new variety.  If that person or company can't or chooses not to name a variety, someone else
may give a variety a name for marketing purposes.  In any case, the "name first used when the
seed is introduced into commerce" will be the name of the variety.<p>

<p>

	It is illegal to change a variety name once the name has been legally assigned.  In other
words, a buyer may not purchase seed labeled as variety "X" and resell it as variety "Y".  In
the case where seedsmen are buying lines from plant breeders to market under their own name,
it is important to determine if indeed the line has or has not been introduced into general
commerce previously.  If a seedsman purchases "exclusive" rights of ownership of a newly
released line, and that line has not been purchased by anyone else, then the seedsman purchasing
such exclusive rights to the line may assign the "variety" name to it.  However, if the same line
is offered to other buyers as well, then the variety name or number must be the one used by the
discoverer or breeder of that line during the initial time the line is offered for sale.  Individual seedsmen purchasing such a line have the option of labeling that line by brand name with or
without disclosing the original variety designation.  If the seedsman chooses not to disclose the
original variety name, the following guidelines should be followed utilizing appropriate brand
name nomenclature and the "variety not stated" labeling option.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 6.  BRAND NAME LABELING</b><p>

<p>

	Brand names and terms taken from trademarks may be associated with the kind and
variety names as an indication of source.  However, such terms shall be clearly indicated as
being other than part of the name of the kind and variety.<p>

<p>

	The Indiana Seed Law now defines the term "brand" as a word, name, number, or design
used to identify seed of one person to distinguish it from seed of another person.  Brand names
may be used in conjunction with "variety not stated" labeling for individual lines, mixtures, and
blends as long as such brand names are clearly indicated as being other than part of the name
of the kind, variety, mixture or blend.  The word "brand" must be included as a part of the
brand name to avoid any misrepresentation of the name of the product.<p>

<p>

	A private brand seed variety marketed under the "variety not stated" labeling option of
section 4(a) of the seed law may be labeled with a brand designation as mentioned previously. 
When a brand name is stated but no variety name, the terms must be shown on the seed label
in the following order from left to right or top to bottom:<p>

	(1)	the brand name;<p>

	(2)	the word "brand";<p>

	(3)	the kind name;<p>

	(4)	the words "variety not stated".<p>

<p>

For example:  ACME 1234 BRAND WHEAT<p>

			Variety Not Stated<p>

<p>

	Placement of the word "brand" is extremely important to properly indicate the complete
brand designation.  In the above example, the brand name is clearly represented as "Acme
1234".<p>

<p>

	Section 15-4-1-6(b)(10) of the Indiana Seed Law states that "it is unlawful for any person
within this state to assign the same brand designation to more than one variety or blend of the
same kind of seed, if not sold by variety name".  This simply means that a particular variety or
line may only have one brand name assigned to it by an individual seedsman throughout the
period of time that he chooses to market that brand.  As an example, if variety "X" is sold as
"Acme 1234 Brand" the first year, it must also be sold as "Acme 1234 Brand" in subsequent
years by the same seedsman.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 7.  BLEND LABELING AND ADVERTISING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	The labeling and advertising of a varietal mixture or blend must not create the impression
that the seed is a single variety.  Blends may be assigned brand names, and the word "Blend"
must be included as a part of that name.  For example, if a soybean product were a blend of
three varieties, the label or advertising could not read "Golden Pod Soybeans" because "Golden
Pod" could be mistaken for a variety name.  The same soybeans could be sold as "Golden Pod
Brand Soybean Blend" or "Golden Pod Soybean Blend".<p>

<p>

	The following three examples cover most options for labeling blends in Indiana:<p>

	A.	Blend containing two varieties (protected publics) with all varieties stated.  The
blend must be labeled with the percentage by weight and germination of each
component.  For example:<p>

<p>

		ACME 5500 BRAND WHEAT BLEND			Lot Number 1<p>

<p>

	49.75% Caldwell			Germination:  95%	Origin:  IN<p>

	49.70% Auburn			Germination:  95%	Origin:  OH<p>

	   .00% Other Crop Seed<p>

	   .50% Inert Matter			Germ Test Date:  Sept. 1986<p>

	   .05% Weed Seed			Noxious Weed Seeds - None<p>

<p>

	B.	A blend containing three varieties with one variety stated (protected public) and
the other two labeled "Varieties Not Stated".  For example:<p>

<p>

		ACME 5600 BRAND WHEAT BLEND		Lot Number 2<p>

<p>

	49.75% Caldwell			Germination:  95%	Origin:  IN<p>

	49.75% Varieties Not Stated	Germination:  95%	Origin:  IN<p>

	   .00% Other Crop Seed<p>

	   .50% Inert Matter			Germ Test Date:  Sept. 1986<p>

	   .00% Weed Seed			Noxious Weed Seeds - None<p>

<p>

	C.	A blend containing any number of components that are labeled "varieties not
stated" may be represented by one common pure seed percentage, one
germination percentage, and one hard seed percentage, if applicable, for the blend
as a whole.  Keep in mind that multiple varieties labeled under a group term must
use the plural form of the term, such as "varieties not stated".  For example:<p>

<p>

		ACME 5700 BRAND SOYBEAN BLEND		Lot Number 3<p>

			VARIETIES NOT STATED<p>

	99.50% Pure Seed			Germination:  90%	Origin:  IN<p>

	   .00% Other Crop Seed<p>

	   .50% Inert Matter			Noxious Weed Seeds - None<p>

	   .00% Weed Seed			Germ Test Date:  Jan. 1986<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 8.  MIXTURE LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	Seed mixtures consisting of 2 or more different kinds of seed, each present in excess of
5% by weight, shall be labeled to indicate such by use of the term "Mixture" as a part of the
name for the product.  The percentage by weight and name of each component shall be listed
in order of predominance, along with a separate germination percentage and hard seed
percentage (where applicable) for each component of the mixture.  The origin of each component
shall also be listed.  Crop kinds sold under "common kind designations" such as kentucky
bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and medium red clover, as examples, must be labeled as "variety
not stated" when not labeled by variety name.  The former version of the seed law provided for
a Rule which exempted 17 different crop kinds from the mandatory variety labeling requirement. 
Crops commonly sold by common kind designations could be labeled as such with or without
varietal reference.  Such crops now must be labeled appropriately with the phrase "variety not
stated".  For example:<p>

<center>Medium Red clover  Lot Number 123</center>
<p>

<center>Variety Not Stated</center>
<p>

	An example of a mixture label is as follows:<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 9.  BULK SEED LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	Seed sold in bulk form is required to be labeled with the same information as required
on packaged products.  However, in cases of bulk sales, the invoice may serve as the master
label for the given quantity being sold.  All label information should be printed on the invoice
or delivery ticket at the time the customer takes possession of the lot, or a tag containing the
label information may be attached to the invoice.<p>

<p>

	In the case of bulk sales made by a seedsman using "Official State Seed Commissioner
Tags", a sufficient number of tags must be provided to the customer to cover the weight of the
total purchase.<p>

<p>

	For example, a bulk sale consisting of 1,200 pounds of seed must be accompanied by 24
- 50 lb. tags or 16 - 75lb. tags, or 12 - 100lb. tags, etc.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 10.  TREATED SEED LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	The Indiana Seed Law and the Federal Seed Act require that all treated seeds be labeled
to show the "commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic) or abbreviated chemical name". 
The proprietary or trade name is unacceptable by itself.  If shown, the trade name must be in
a subordinate position to the coined, generic, or abbreviated chemical name of the product.<p>

<p>

	Some examples are shown below:<p>

<p>

	1)	"Vitavax" is a proprietary name for a product containing "Carboxin", which is
the commonly accepted coined name for that substance.<p>

<p>

	2)	"Granox" is a proprietary name for a combination of "HCB" and "MANEB",
which are the commonly accepted coined names for those chemicals.<p>

<p>

	Most chemical companies who provide pre-printed labels to their customers are careful
to meet these requirements.  However, mislabeling sometimes occurs when seed firms make
their own tags.  Many tags are observed having only proprietary names, and not the coined
generic, or abbreviated chemical names as required.<p>

<p>

	The "Farm Chemicals Handbook", (Meister Publishing Company, Willoughby, Ohio) is
an excellent reference for this information.  Questions, regarding treatment substances can also
be directed to the Office Of The Indiana State Seed Commissioner.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 11.  VIGOR LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	There continues to be much interest in "Vigor" tests, vigor testing, and vigor labeling
of agricultural seeds because of the additional and valuable information that is obtained when
such tests are used "in house".  These types of tests, along with other tests become very helpful
for evaluating lots of seed over a wide range of stresses and conditions.<p>

<p>

	However, methods for such tests have not yet been standardized by any official testing
governing body, such as the AOSA, (Association of Official Seed Analysts).  AOSA has
continued to make progress in developing methods of vigor tests, but much variability exists
between the numerous test methods being used.  Because of this variety and variability of vigor
tests, any reference in the form of publicity, advertising and labeling to vigor tested, vigor
testing, vigor rated, etc. is considered incomplete and misleading unless "defined" and explained
appropriately on the label, including a vigor test date.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><p>

<p>

SECTION 12.  HYBRID SEED LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	If any kind and variety of seed present in excess of 5% is "Hybrid" seed, it shall be
designated "Hybrid" on the label.  The percentage that is hybrid shall be at least 95% of the
percentage of pure seed shown unless the percentage of pure seed which is hybrid seed is shown
separately.  If two or more kinds or varieties are present in excess of 5%, each that is hybrid
shall be designated as hybrid on the label.  Any kind and variety that has pure seed which is less
than 95% but more than 75% hybrid seed as a result of incompletely controlled pollination in
a cross shall be labeled to show the percentage of pure seed that is hybrid seed.  No one kind
and variety of seed may be labeled as hybrid if the pure seed contains less than 75% hybrid
seed.  It may be labeled as a mixture or blend.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 13.  CARRYOVER SEED LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	When agricultural and vegetable seeds remain in the inventory of a distributor after the
germination test has expired (9 months) the seed must be removed from sale or relabeled.  New
percentages of germination and hard seeds, (where applicable) and the new germination test date
may be entered on the tags previously attached to the seed only if these items are inserted in
such a way as to be clearly legible and the old percentages of germination, hard seeds, and date
of test are completely obliterated.  In all cases where such changes are necessary the attachment
of new tags is advised.<p>

<p>

	The person upon whose premises the seed is located shall be held responsible for
obtaining the new test and for subsequent relabeling of the seed.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 14.  TOLERANCES APPLIED TO LABEL GUARANTEES</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	If we flip a coin 10 times, we don't necessarily get 5 heads and 5 tails, and if we flip it
again 10 times, we don't expect to repeat the same heads-tails ratio as the first time.  Likewise,
if one person who tests a lot of seed and gets 85 percent germination, 88.61 percent pure seed,
and no noxious weed seeds, we don't expect the next person who tests the lot to get exactly the
same results.  We, therefore, have tolerances to compensate for the expected variation between
one test and another.<p>

<p>

	Tolerance tables which are used are found in the "Rules for Testing Seeds" published by
the Association of Official Seed Analysts allow for both mathematical and experimental error. 
They are based on the following concepts:<p>

<p>

	1)	The tolerances are to be used to determine whether the second analysis is
significantly poorer than the first.<p>

<p>

	2)	The labeled analysis (first analysis) and the inspection analysis (second analysis)
are both unbiased estimates.<p>

<p>

	3)	The probability of error is 5 percent.<p>

<p>

	4)	Each analysis is of one working sample.<p>

<p>

	5)	There are 2 samples.<p>

<p>

	6)	Tolerances for "chaffy" and "non-chaffy" kinds differ.<p>

<p>

	7)	Tolerances for unmixed and mixed kinds differ.<p>

<p>

	In summary, tolerances are used to determine significant differences between analyses
of a given lot of seed.  It is advised that tolerances should not be used to determine label
guarantees, or be built into label guarantees.  Seed should be labeled accurately based on actual
analysis information.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 15.  "NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS IN INDIANA"</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	Section 6 of the Indiana Seed Law states it is unlawful to distribute seed within Indiana
if the seed contains or consists of  PROHIBITED Noxious weed seeds, and/or if seed contains
or consists of RESTRICTED Noxious weed seeds in excess of 0.25% by weight.  The name and
number per pound of each RESTRICTED Noxious weed seed must be shown on a seed tag or
label if present in quantities less than 0.25%.<p>

<p>

	The following weeds are classified as "Noxious" weeds in Indiana when found in seeds
offered for sale for seeding purposes.  There are other specific laws currently in effect in Indiana
which deal with illegal propagation and infestation of specific weeds and which are enforced by
local government agencies.<p>

<p>

<center><b>CERTIFIED SEED LABELING</b></center>
<p>

<p>

	An act of the 1935 Indiana state legislature provides for the state certification of seeds,
plants, or plant parts.  In Indiana, the certification of agronomic crops has been delegated to the
Indiana Crop Improvement Association by the Director of the Purdue University Agricultural
Experiment Station under the state law governing seed certification.  Rules and regulations
concerning certification are approved by the Director of the Experiment Station and are applied
by the Indiana Crop Improvement Association.<p>

<p>

PURPOSE OF CERTIFICATION - <p>

<p>

	1.	To provide a system whereby newly developed crop varieties can be increased
into sufficient quantities for distribution to the Indiana farmer.<p>

<p>

	2.	The primary objective of certifying seed is to maintain the genetic purity and
identity of the seed from the time it leaves the plant breeder until it is available
to the farmer.<p>

<p>

	Each person or company who certifies seed in Indiana must follow the policies and
procedures that have been established by the Indiana Crop Improvement Association.  If the seed
has been produced in such a manner that it does meet all of the standards that have been
established for Certified Seed, official tags are issued to the grower in order that they may be
attached to each bag of seed that he sells.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 1.  REQUIRED FORMAT FOR CERTIFICATION TAGS</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	Variety name must be stated.<p>

<p>

		a.	The variety must be eligible for certification in Indiana.<p>

		b.	Once a name is established for a particular variety or blend, that name
should not change.<p>

<p>

	2.	Kind of seed must be stated:  Soybeans, Wheat, Corn, etc.<p>

<p>

	3.	An Identifying number must be on the tag.<p>

<p>

		a.	Indiana uses a producer number as a reference number on certified tags. 
This is a 3-digit number assigned to each producer of certified seed in the
state.<p>

		b.	The fourth digit in the producer number indicates year of production.  The
fourth digit is equivalent to the last digit of the year in which the crop was
produced.<p>

<p>

	4.	A lot number must be on the tag.<p>

<p>

		a.	This is any combination of letters or numbers assigned by the seedsman
to identify a particular batch of seed.<p>

		b.	The lot number of the certified tag and the analysis tag should match.<p>

<p>

		c.	The certified lot number should also match the lot number on the bag or
package.<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 2.  LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASSES OF CERTIFIED SEED</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	All certified seed, when offered for sale, shall have an official certification label
affixed to each container, except in the case of bulk sales.<p>

<p>

	2.	The appropriate labels will be issued for the specific classes of seed:  Foundation,
Registered and Certified.<p>

<p>

	3.	The Michigan Certification scheme has no Registered seed class.  All Michigan
Certified class seed is produced from Foundation seed.  In addition, Michigan
will not accept the Certified class of seed (blue label) from other states, unless it
has been produced from Foundation Seed.  To facilitate the movement of certified
seed into Michigan, the Indiana Crop Improvement Association will place an "R"
on the certified (blue) tag to verify seed lots are the progeny of Foundation seed. 
Seed with Registered labels meets the Michigan requirements with no additional
labeling.<p>

<p>

	4.	Analysis tags and information on the bag should reflect the actual class of seed
being shipped.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 3.  PLANT VARIETY PROTECTION LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	There are three possibilities associated with plant variety protection.<p>

<p>

		a.	NOT PROTECTED - Variety is not protected by the Plant Variety
Protection Office.  The variety may be sold in the marketplace without the
permission of the owner of the variety.<p>

		b.	U.S. PROTECTED VARIETY - The variety is protected by the Plant
Variety Protection Office.  If can be sold only with the permission of the
owner of the variety.  The words U.S. PROTECTED VARIETY should
appear on the analysis tag or somewhere on the package.<p>

		c.	TITLE V PROTECTION - The variety is protected under the Title V
option of Plant Variety Protection and can be sold by variety name only
as a class of certified seed.  The certified tag carries the following
statement:  UNAUTHORIZED PROPAGATION PROHIBITED - U.S.
PROTECTED VARIETY.  TO BE SOLD BY VARIETY NAME ONLY. 
AS A CLASS OF CERTIFIED SEED.<p>

<p>

	2.	It is unlawful to sell uncertified seed of a variety protected under the Title V
option unless permission is obtained from the owner to sell such seed "Variety
Not Stated".<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 4.  CERTIFIED BLEND LABELING</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	All components in a certified blend must be certified.<p>

<p>

	2.	Title V varieties cannot be used in uncertified blends without the owner's
permission (see Section 3).<p>

<p>

	3.	It is not necessary to list the components of a blend on a certified tag.  Blend
components will be kept on file (confidentially) by the agency.  See section
relating to analysis tag information - Section 7 of the Seed Law Requirements.<p>

<p>

	4.	The blend name or number must be consistent.  If components or percentage of
components change, assign a new designation to the blend.<p>

<p>

	5.	Protection statements will be used if any of the components of the blend are
protected.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 5.  BULK MOVEMENT AND SALE OF CERTIFIED SEED</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	There are three types of bulk movement of certified seed:<p>

		a.	Bulk sale of unconditioned seed (seedsmen)<p>

		b.	Bulk sale of cleaned seed (consumers)<p>

		c.	Bulk sale of seed to applicators (fertilizer)<p>

<p>

<center><b>BULK SALE OF UNCONDITIONED SEED</b></center>
<p>

	1.	This is movement of unconditioned seed from one seedsman to another.  It
involves wholesaling of seed in the bulk.<p>

<p>

	2.	The seedsman selling the seed is responsible for filing a bulk transfer certificate
available from the Certification Office.<p>

<p>

	3.	It is the buyer's responsibility to complete certification on the seed by submitting
a final certification sample and ordering certified tags with the buyer's producer
number through the certification office.<p>

<p>

	4.	The buyer of unconditioned certified seed must be a certified seed producer.<p>

<p>

	5.	If seed is bulked to an Indiana seedsman from another state it must be
accompanied by a bulk transfer certificate as is necessary if bulk seed is sent out
of state.<p>

<p>

	6.	When seed is produced in another state and bagged in Indiana the origin of the
seed should be indicated on the certified tag and the state tag.<p>

<p>

	7.	Since this is a cooperative effort between certifying agencies, the word
INTERAGENCY will appear somewhere on the certified tag.<p>

<p>

	8.	Seed can be moved in bulk only once.<p>

planting.<p>

<p>

	2.	The seedsman must file a Bulk Retail Sale Certificate available from the
Certification Office.  A copy of the bulk retail sales certificate goes to the farmer
who purchases the seed.  This certificate also provides analysis information for
the farmer since no other tags are involved in these sales.<p>

<p>

	3.	Certification tags are not used in these sales.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center>BULK SALES TO APPLICATOR - CERTIFIED CLASS ONLY</center>
<p>

<p>

	1.	A seedsman may sell cleaned seed in the bulk to an applicator or firm involved
in mixing the seed with non-seed products.<p>

<p>

	2.	An applicator is usually a fertilizer company that is spreading seed with fertilizer.<p>

<p>

	3.	The seedsman must file a Bulk Retail Sales Certificate available from the
Certification Office.  A copy of the certificate accompanies the seed to the
applicator.  This certificate also provides analysis information for the farmer since
no other tags are involved in these sales.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 6.  REBAGGING OF CERTIFIED SEED</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	When seed is rebagged and/or reconditioned, new certification tags are generally
needed.<p>

<p>

	2.	New lot numbers can be assigned to seed that has been rebagged and/or
reconditioned.<p>

<p>

	3.	The certification tags will still indicate the year of production in the producer
number - not the year of rebagging.<p>

<p>

	4.	Rebagged seed from another state must indicate origin of seed.<p>

<p>

	5.	All rebagged seed or reconditioned seed is reported to the Certification Office
using a "Reconditioning Form" available from the agency.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 7.  LABELING CARRY-OVER LOTS OF CERTIFIED SEED</b><p>

<p>

<p>

	1.	It is not necessary to put a new certified label on seed that has been carried over
in the same package.<p>

<p>

	2.	If new tags are requested for carry-over seed, the year of production will be part
of the producer number on the certified tag.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 8.  UNIFORM LABELING INVOLVING LABEL AND CONTAINERS</b><p>

<p>

	1.	Variety names, kind, and lot numbers of the certification tag should match the
information on the analysis tag and the bag, and not conflict with any other
information on the package.<p>

<p>

	2.	Seed may not be sold in bags with a different kind of seed stated on the bag.  In
other words - SOYBEANS cannot be sold in bags that are designated as WHEAT.<p>

<p>

	3.	The company name on the analysis tag and the company name on the bag should
match.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 9.  ATTACHING LABELS BEFORE SEED IS DISTRIBUTED</b><p>

<p>

	1.	When bagged seed is transported, labels must be attached.  The certified tags
must be affixed to the bag when the seed leaves the plant.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 10. CERTIFIED BAGS CARRYING NON-CERTIFIED SEED</b><p>

<p>

	1.	Only officially certified seed may be sold in bags bearing certification labels; or
in bags that have printing or designates or implies in any way the seed is
certified.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>SECTION 11. QUALITY ASSURANCE LABELS</b><p>

<p>

	1.	The quality assurance label is issued by Indiana Crop Improvement Association
for seed meeting all the requirements of the Indiana Crop Improvement Quality
Assurance Program.<p>

<p>

	2.	The label is green with the phrase "ICIA Inspected" in conjunction with the ICIA
quality assurance logo.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

	3.	Seed lots bearing this label have met standards for field inspection, laboratory
evaluation and post-control growouts; based upon an applicant/breeder's
description.<p>

<p>

	4.	The following information appears on the Quality Assurance Label:<p>

<p>

		a.	Variety, brand, or blend designation<p>

		b.	The phrase "Variety or Varieties Not Stated" if applicable<p>

		c.	Kind of seed<p>
