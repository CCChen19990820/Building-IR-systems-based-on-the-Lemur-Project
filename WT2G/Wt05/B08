<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>One of the most effective waste minimization programs that can be established is the active life-cycle management of hazardous materials before they become hazardous waste.  </P>

<P> The active life-cycle management program provides procedures that allows hazardous material users the option to extend the life of certain hazardous materials after their shelf life term has expired.  These procedures include defining the following for each individual material stored:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Shelf Life Item</P>

<P><li> Shelf Life Code</P>

<P><li> Acceptable Quality Level</P>

<P><li> Condition Code</P>

<P><li> Shelf-life Action Code (SLAC)</P>

<P><li> Sampling and Inspection Tests</P>
</ul>
<P> <B>Shelf-life Item</B>. Item or material possessing deteriorative or unstable characteristics to the degree that a storage time period must be assigned to assure that item will perform satisfactorily in services. Shelf-life items are categorized into two types:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Type I. An item of supply which is determined through an evaluation of technical test data and/or actual experience to be an item with a definite non-extendible period of shelf-life. The single digit shelf-life code designating Type I material is a letter (A-S).</P>

<P><li> Type II. An item of supply having an assigned shelf-life time period that may be extended after completion of an inspection, test, or restorative action. The single digit shelf-life code designating Type II material is a number (1-9).</P>
</ol>
<P> <B>Shelf-life Code</B>. A code assigned to a shelf-life item to indicate its storage time period. Shelf-life codes are standard within the Department of Defense (DOD) and are published regularly. For example, items used by the Navy which have an assigned shelf-life code are listed monthly in NAVSUP PUB 4105 (List of Items Requiring Special Handling [LIRSH]).</P>

<P> <B>Acceptable Quality Level</B>. The maximum percent defective (or the maximum number of defects per hundred units) that, for purposes of sampling inspection, can be considered satisfactory as a process average.</P>

<P> <B>Condition Code</B>. A code assigned to classify material in terms of its readiness for issue and use, or to identify action underway to change the status of material. The condition codes used by stocking activities in shelf-life procedures are listed below. &quot;Users&quot; of the material normally do not downgrade condition codes in this manner. They leave the material in &quot;A&quot; condition until the shelf-life has expired.</P>

<P> <B>Shelf-life Action Code (SLAC)</B>. A code assigned to a shelf-life item to specify the type of inspection, test, or restorative action to be taken when the item has reached the end of its designated shelf-life. It also specifies the allowed extension period for the item after the inspection, test, or restorative action has been completed. NAVSUP PUB 4105 promulgates the Shelf-life Action Code (SLAC) for items used by the Navy that have  assigned shelf-life codes.</P>

<P> <B>Sampling and Inspection Tests</B>.  On-site tests conducted on Type II materials to extend the material&#146;s shelf life.  In most cases, shelf-life extension tests are not complicated, do not require a laboratory, and can be done on the spot by anyone with a minimum amount of training.  In many cases they consist of visual checks for damage or deterioration.</P>

<P> An effective shelf-life extension program is a critical part of life-cycle management.  A significant portion of hazardous materials turned in for disposal are in their original packaging and meet the performance requirements as defined in the military specification.  Unfortunately, the material is declared unusable solely because it has reached the end of its designated shelf-life term.  </P>

<P> The shelf life code of a given hazardous materials is dependent upon many parameters including storage conditions, packaging, the chemistry of the material, and it&#146;s critical use.</P>

<P> Shelf-life extension programs are the single most neglected aspect of shelf-life management. Organizations (users as well as suppliers) generally do not conduct in-house inspections of tests to extend the shelf-life of their material. They either don't extend shelf-life at all or rely on the monthly DOD Quality Status Listing (QSL) to tell them what shelf-life material can be extended and for how long. When the QSL is used, extension efforts often consist solely of re-marking material with the new expiration dates published in the QSL. There is nothing wrong with that, and it needs to be done, but the QSL primarily lists only DLA-managed items that require laboratory testing. Items that require only visual checks are not listed; neither are GSA-managed items. There is a DOD initiative underway to extend the QSL into a DOD listing that will include material managed by DLA and all military services.  Unfortunately, it will be some time before it becomes fully integrated and it will never list items that require only visual checks to do extensions.</P>

<P> In-house inspections and tests are adequate for most material. It is, however, often difficult for personnel to find descriptions of the specific inspections or tests required to extend the shelf-life of particular items. There is no single source of test information. GSA and all military services except the Navy have developed separate storage standards with extension criteria for the material they manage.  Each DLA Inventory Control Point (ICP) has developed storage standards for material managed by the particular ICP. Every command should have a collection of those standards. Together, they represent the existing universe of shelf-life extension test and inspection guidelines. Individual product specifications are the only other source of inspection and test information. Storage Standard Points of Contact are listed in DOD 4140.27-M (Shelf-Life Item Management Manual).</P>

<P> The Navy has not yet developed storage standards for shelf-life extension inspections and tests on Navy-managed material. In the absence of specific guidelines, use common sense. For most Type II material, shelf-life extension tests are not complicated, do not require a laboratory, and can be done on the spot by anyone with a minimum amount of training. They are usually nothing more than visual checks for damage or deterioration.</P>

<P> Navy Item Managers refer callers to Fed-Std-793 (Depot Storage Standards) when asked what tests need to be conducted to extend the life of particular products.</P>

<P> Another highly effective hazardous material shelf-life management technique is the comprehensive study of a specific hazardous material to determine the material&#146;s true shelf-life term.  In many cases the shelf-life term of hazardous materials are too conservative.  In many cases, hazardous material users depend upon conservative manufacturer recommendations in defining shelf-life terms.  It is also noteworthy that in recent years, the chemical stability and packaging of hazardous materials has improved significantly.  As a result, shelf-life terms that were defined prior to these improvements are likely to be too conservative.  The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) has conducted several studies to determine the true shelf-life term of hazardous materials that are commonly procured by the Navy.  Only hazardous materials that are purchased in large volumes and historically have been disposed as a hazardous waste due to expired shelf-life terms were considered for study.  These studies have indicated that the shelf-life term of approximately 50% of hazardous materials procured by the Navy are too conservative.</P>

<P> The primary classes of hazardous materials undertaken for study by NAVSUP were: (1) Chemicals, (2) Paints, Sealants, and Adhesives, and (3) Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POLs).  The table presented below summarizes the results of the study:</P>

</TABLE>

<P> The table indicates that for many materials an increase in the shelf-life term is appropriate.  However, prior to implementing an increase in shelf-life term for a specific material, the materials degradation mode, packaging and anticipated storage conditions must be studied to determine if a shelf-life term increase is appropriate.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis: </H3>

<P>The savings incurred through reduced disposal costs and reduced reordering of materials varies widely depending on the quantity of material purchased annually and the purchase and disposal costs.  The example presented below is of a common detergent with a shelf-life term of 36 months.  A study of this detergent&#146;s degradation mode, packaging and storage conditions revealed that 48 months is a more appropriate shelf-life term.  The economic benefit from the lengthening of this material&#146;s shelf-life term is presented below:</P>

<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> 35,000 gallons of detergent (NSN 7930-00-282-9699) is purchased annually</P>

<P><li> Purchase cost: $12/gallon</P>

<P><li> 1,800 gallons disposed annually as a hazardous waste due to expired shelf-life term.</P>

<P><li> Disposal cost: $21.10/gallon</P>

<P><li> Current shelf-life term of detergent: 36 months</P>

<P><li> Recommended shelf-life term: 48 months</P>

<P><li> Increasing the shelf-life term by 33% (36 to 48 months) will result in a 33% savings in new purchase and disposal costs</P>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), as part of their hazardous waste minimization and pollution prevention initiatives, has developed a policy for &quot;affirmative procurement&quot; of various hazardous materials (HM). The objective of this policy is to significantly reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances, through the use of affirmative procurement practices. In so doing, the federal government seeks to become a leader in the world wide phaseout of these substances.</P>

<P> Executive Order 12843, entitled, &quot;Procurement Requirements and Policies for Federal Agencies for Ozone-Depleting Substances,&quot; was issued on April 21, 1993, by President Clinton. The executive order is intended to reduce the federal government's procurement and use of substances that cause stratospheric ozone depletion, in accordance with the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, to which the United States is a signatory. The executive order includes the following provisions:</P>

<P>1. The federal agencies (including all military departments) shall, to the extent practicable:</P>
<ul>
<P> a. conform their procurement policies and practices to the stratospheric ozone protection requirements included in Title VI of the Clean Air Act;</P>

<P> b. maximize the use of safe alternatives to ozone-depleting substances;</P>

<P> c. evaluate the present and future use of ozone-depleting substances, and evaluate their use of, and plans for recycling;</P>

<P> d. revise their procurement programs and practices to specify use of non ozone-depleting substances, to the extent economically practicable; and</P>

<P> e. exercise leadership and develop exemplary practices related to phasing out the use of ozone-depleting substances.</P>
</ul>
<P>2. Defines ozone-depleting substances as those controlled internationally by the Montreal Protocol and nationally under Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments. This includes both Class I and Class II substances, as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P> a. Class I substances includes chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform.</P>

<P> b. Class II substances include hydrochlorofluorocarbons and any other substances so designated by the EPA by any subsequent regulations.</P>
</ul>
<P>3. Federal Policy: The policy to be followed by federal agencies is to implement cost-effective programs to minimize the procurement of materials and substances that contribute to the depletion of stratospheric ozone, and give preference to the procurement of alternative chemicals, products, and manufacturing processes that reduce overall risks to human health and the environment by lessening the depletion of ozone in the upper atmosphere. This policy encourages federal agencies to conform their procurement policies to the general requirements of Title VI of the Clean Air Act Amendments. Key elements of the policy are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P> a. Minimizing the procurement of products containing or manufactured with Class I substances, and maximizing the use of safe alternatives. Federal agencies should also be aware of the EPA phaseout schedule for Class II substances;</P>

<P> b. Amending existing contracts to be consistent with the phaseout schedule for Class I substances. Agencies should also be aware of the phaseout schedule for Class II substances in awarding new contracts;</P>

<P> c. Implementing practices which recognize the limited availability of Class I substances, such as reducing emissions and recycling ozone-depleting substances; ceasing the purchase of nonessential products containing ozone-depleting substances; and requiring that any new contracts provide that acquired products containing Class I or Class II substances be labeled in accordance with Section 611 of the Clean Air Act Amendments.</P>

<h2 align=center>Compost Turning and Aeration Using Windrow Turners</h2>
<p align=center><img src="/icons/tspiralc.gif">
<P>

<P><B>Revision:</B> 8/96</P>

<P><B>Process Code:</B> Navy: N/A; Air Force: N/A; Army: N/A</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Low; Air Force: Low</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> N/A</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> N/A</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Windrow turners are used to turn and aerate compost in windrows (long extended piles).  Windrow turners break up anaerobic pockets in the compost, introduce oxygen, and release heat from the pile.  Windrow turners are especially suited for high-volume facilities.</P>

<P> Large windrow turners are typically self-propelled and straddle the windrow, using a cylindrical drum with attached flails to mix the compost.  Smaller windrow turners consist of a unit that can be attached to a front-end loader or tractor that is driven between windrows.  This side-mounted unit may have the advantage of being more economical for sites that do not require a full-time windrow turner.  However, since they turn only half of the pile or windrow, more passes are needed for each pile and labor hours are increased.</P>

<P> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills by an average of 15.9% (EPA, 1994).</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using windrow turners concerns the operation of power equipment and health issues of working with decomposing organic matter.  Operators should be specifically trained to use the turner.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and hearing protection should be used if needed.  Consult the base safety office on proper PPE and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Turns more cubic yards of compost per hour than a front-end loader</P>

<P><li> Produces compost with a superior texture relative to that produced by a front-end loader</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Turner design and size limits windrow dimensions to a maximum of five to seven feet high and 14 to 18 feet wide at the base</P>

<P><li> Windrow turners require level surfaces to operate efficiently </P>

<P><li> Can be difficult to move from site to site</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Windrow turners cost can vary from approximately $45,000 to $250,000.  These units can process from 2,000 cubic yards/hour (requires front-end loader) to 4,000 cubic yards/hour (self-propelled unit).  Operating costs, not including labor, are $18/hour to $35/hour, respectively.</P>

<P> The cost of constructing and operating a windrow composting facility will vary from one location to another.  The capital costs include compost pads, grinder, compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loader, windrow turner, and offices.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Process 3000 tons/yr of yard waste, food waste, etc.</P>

<P><li> Produce 1,500 tons/yr of finished compost</P>

<P><li> Capital costs:  $600,000 (does not include land costs)</P>

<P><li> Solid waste disposal costs:  $20/ton</P>

<P><li> Cost to pickup and haul waste to landfill:  $50/ton</P>

<P><li> Operating costs (labor and maintenance):  $165,000/yr</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Waste paper has been estimated to represent 35-40% of the waste presently disposed in landfills.  The pollution prevention goal for federal facilities reduction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is 50%.  Significant progress toward this goal can be achieved through waste paper recycling.  Recycling offers the opportunity to decrease the cost of landfill disposal and provide a renewable source of pulp for recycled paper production as well as a number of other uses.  Recycling and reuse of paper also decreases the quantity of virgin timber required to produce the volume of paper products consumed annually.</P>

<P> The quality of recycled paper products continue to improve thereby increasing the demand for recyclable paper, especially, Office Waste Paper (OWP), which is normally of higher quality due to a higher fiber content.  This paper is now recycled for use in printing and writing paper, graphics stock, and tissue paper.  The paper industry has been improving and integrating paper de-inking processes in existing mills in order to improve their ability to increase the quantity and quality of their recycled pulp feedstocks.  Some projections indicate that there could be a shortage of recycled feedstocks in the near future if the quantities of recycled paper do not increase.</P>

<P> In order to achieve the most effective recycling and reuse program for waste paper, it is important to understand the different types of waste paper generated and develop programs that minimize commingling of non-compatible paper types.  Typical types of paper to be segregated include office waste paper, newspaper, cardboard, and other lower quality papers such as wrapping paper and waxed paper.</P>

<P> Other uses for recycled paper include the use of shredded paper for packaging and the production of pelletized paper for use as a renewable fuel source in industrial boilers or power plants.  These uses are often associated with lower quality waste paper not appropriate for recycling into writing/printing grade paper.  The generation of shredded paper has increased in numerous industries and agencies.  The advantages of shredding paper for reuse as packaging are decreased costs in alternative packaging media such as Styrofoam peanuts.  Shredded paper can also be composted as opposed to disposed of in landfills (See Paper Shredder Data Sheet).</P>

<P> Another waste paper reuse alternative is in the production of fuel pellets.   Lower grade waste paper is pelletized and utilized as a solid fuel source in industrial boilers.  Pelletized paper has similar physical characteristics to conventional solid fuels, is easily consumed by boilers, and can be produced at competitive costs.  The advantages of using palletized paper fuel include: a new use for discarded paper; reduction in the consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels; paper provides a higher level of heat generation; and because paper contains little sulfur, its co-firing with coal reduces sulfur emissions.  Paper also produces 10-20% less carbon than coal.</P>

<P> A comprehensive paper recycling program should include an inventory of existing waste paper sources, management of the wastes to minimize mixing of higher and lower quality materials, and the identification of appropriate recycling alternatives for the various grades of paper in the area of the facility.  Proper management and diversion will result in lower landfill disposal costs, potential energy savings, and environmental benefits.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper storage and handling of recycled paper prior to off-site shipment should include an evaluation and reduction of potential fire hazards associated with accumulating loose, waste paper.  Most hazards can be reduced by regular collections and storage in appropriate containers away from heat sources.  Consult your local fire prevention officials for specific evaluation and recommendations.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume and expense of waste disposed in landfills</P>

<P><li> Reduces the volume of new timber required in the production of paper products</P>

<P><li> Reduces the use of non-renewable fossil fuels if pelletized and reused as solid fuel source</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires handling and transportation to recycling facilities</P>

<P><li> Requires sorting to obtain most beneficial reuse for each type of paper</P>

<P><li> Requires personnel training to be effective</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The following cost elements for a recycling program represent those anticipated for a typical Navy application:  2,000 tons of waste paper per year with no capital costs and operating costs associated with establishing and managing recycling program. Assumes local recycler will provide storage containers and pick up the waste paper and recycle at no cost to the facility.</P>

<ul>
<P><li> The facility/base produces 2,000 tons/year of paper waste</P>

<P><li> Capital Costs: None</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Evaporation is a proven technology for reducing aqueous wastes.  By using active evaporation or heating to evaporate excess water, hazardous waste rinse water disposal or wastewater treatment can be minimized.</P>

<P> Evaporator units discussed in this data sheet are gas-fired and fully factory assembled.  The following are the design, process, and safety requirements for these units:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Evaporation rate of 30 to 40 gallons/hour;</P>

<P><li> Natural gas-fired (supply available at 8 psig);</P>

<P><li> Compatible with existing electrical supply (120 V);</P>

<P><li> Designed for outdoor duty in a marine environment;</P>

<P><li> 304 Stainless steel construction for all wetted surfaces;</P>

<P><li> Water cooled vapor condenser;</P>

<P><li> Maximum foot print of 8 feet by 8 feet;</P>

<P><li> Fitted with a feed pump;</P>

<P><li> Fitted with a concentrated solution removal pump;</P>

<P><li> Automatic fill level control for the evaporator;</P>

<P><li> Unattended operation for at least 8-hours;</P>

<P><li> Provisions for the removal of sludge from the evaporator;</P>

<P><li> Automatic gas shutdown when the flame goes out;</P>

<P><li> Condensate receiving tank high level shut off and alarm; and</P>

<P><li> Feed tank low level shut off and alarm.</P>
</ul>

<P> In addition to these design requirements there are options for evaporators, including evaporation to the atmosphere versus evaporation and condensing (closed loop), with no waste emissions.  Some manufacturers provide start up, others do not.  All evaporator units require operator training.  Although all evaporator units have their own heat source, the humidity of the location can affect performance.  Atmospheric evaporation, in high humidity locations, will require longer time periods to process a batch.</P>

<P> The effect that an evaporation unit has on pollution prevention is to reduce waste or rinse water by up to 90 percent of the previous volume.  This reduces the quantity of hazardous waste disposal, the costs for disposal, and associated costs such as transportation and drum purchases for hazardous waste disposal.</P>

<P> These evaporative systems have been installed at multiple facilities throughout the Army, Air Force, and the Navy.  One evaporative unit has been in use at Pensacola, Florida Naval Air Station since 1992.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Because this process only handles waste, there are no materials compatibility problems.  It should be noted that these systems are for aqueous waste streams and reduce the amount of water in a waste or rinse stream.  If the evaporator waste stream changes, the evaporation system should be thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross contamination or chemical reactions.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Units are equipped with automatic natural gas shut offs, if the flame goes out there are low and high level alarms for the condensate and feed tanks respectively.  These units must be installed in areas with fire suppression systems, must be protected from the rain, and should not be allowed to freeze.  All of the proper warning signs such as hazardous materials and flammable materials must be posted.  Additionally, all appropriate warning lines must be painted on the floors.  All personnel that will work in the area should be trained prior to operating the evaporator and should be made aware of the potential hazards associated with the process and the required personal protection equipment (PPE).</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces aqueous waste</P>

<P><li> Reduces hazardous waste by up to 90 percent</P>

<P><li> Reduces the cost of hazardous waste disposal</P>

<P><li> Reduces the cost of drums for hazardous waste disposal</P>

<P><li> The units can operate unattended</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires utility hookups for natural gas, electricity, and cooling water</P>

<P><li> Requires installation of a concrete pad, and two 1,500-gallon feed and condensate tanks</P>

<P><li> Requires explosion-proof wall installation</P>

<P><li> May require an air permit for a gas burner (new source) and for evaporation to atmosphere</P>

<P><li> All units require operator training</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> This economic analysis compares the operation of an evaporator versus disposal as a hazardous waste.  The annual waste stream processed is 47,000 pounds of neutralized sulfamic acid contaminated with chrome, and 47,000 pounds of tri-sodium phosphate contaminated with metals.  The employment of an evaporator reduces the quantity of liquid hazardous waste disposal by 90%, resulting in the evaporation of approximately 11,000 gallons of water annually.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Labor to clean the systems is the same for evaporation (E) or disposal as a hazardous waste (DHW).  Labor for operating the evaporation system: 500 hrs/yr</P>

<P><li> 55 gallon drums are required for disposal: E=20 drums, DHW=220 drums</P>

<P><li> Utilities for operating evaporation system:
<BR> Electrical: 7,600 kwhr, $0.10/kwhr
<BR> Water: 200,000 gallons, $4/1000 gallons
<BR> Natural gas: $0.08/gallon water evaporated </P>

<P><li> Cost of waste disposal: $0.75/lb</P>

<P><li> Annual maintenance costs for the evaporator: $2,000</P>

<P><li> Cost of an empty, clean 55 gallon drum: $30/drum</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A variety of wood wastes are generated from construction, demolition, and land clearing operations.  Wood wastes consist of: tree trimmings, scrap wood, pallets, lumber, and shipping containers.  Wood wastes are often classified as Construction and Demolition (C&amp;D) debris.  Wood wastes can be diverted from landfilling and used in a number of applications.  Such applications include lumber reuse, mulch, fibers for manufacturing, animal bedding, and biomass fuel.  Wood wastes can also be used in composting operations.  Wood wastes can be applied to cleared areas for dust suppression and runoff control.  Such wastes can also be reused for small construction and hobby projects.</P>

<P> Wood wastes can be reused in home heating or construction.  Although this diversion strategy is cost-free, it is often difficult to reuse all of the waste products.  If the wood wastes cannot be reused or taken offsite by a recycler, the next viable diversion step is size reduction.  Grinding is the most common method used to reduce the size of wood wastes.  Wood tub grinders are used to reduce wood wastes into smaller particles.  No screening is necessary.  The larger-sized output material from the tub grinder can be used as a biomass fuel or as a bulking agent to balance high nitrogen loads in composting operations.  The smaller-sized material can be composted or used as mulch.  Wood wastes that are chipped or ground will decompose more readily.  Composted wood wastes can be used as a soil amendment or fertilizer.  The reduced wood wastes can also be used as mulch and help grow grass at municipal and commercial landscape applications, such as highway projects and golf courses.  Mulch can also be used to control weed growth.</P>

<P> Wood tub grinders are not limited in opening size like smaller chippers or shredders.  The grinders can process large and odd shaped wood including stumps, pallets, and waste lumber.  Material that is pressure treated, chemically treated, or creosote contaminated should not be composted.  Such wood contains chemicals that inhibit plant growth or are toxic to the environment.  Avoid plywood or particle board since they contain glues which might be hard on machinery, difficult to compost, and contain undesirable chemicals for land application.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using the wood tub grinders concern the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically trained to use the grinder.  Machinery should not be used if workers are intoxicated or on medication.  Proper personal protective equipment including gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Produces usable products such as landscape mulch, fuel, and compost agents</P>

<P><li> Wood wastes can be ground to a fine, even texture that will compost quickly</P>

<P><li> The wood tub grinder can process large trees and finished lumber</P>

<P><li> Reusing or composting wood waste will result in a reduction of disposed waste</P>

<P><li> Composted wood waste can be used as a soil amendment on base, possibly reducing the need for purchased supplies</P>

<P><li> Cost savings are achieved from reduced landfill disposal fees</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Compost mixers are used to mix raw materials such as food, yard waste, paper, and sewage sludge uniformly before composting.  Mixing is an important step to distribute the carbon and nitrogen materials evenly and to assure fast, clean smelling decomposition.  For materials such as food waste and sewage sludge, mixers can be used to incorporate bulking agents such as wood chips that add carbon to the mix and break up wet clumps.  </P>

<P> Mixers are large containers with mobile paddles which are used to mix compostable materials.  They are used for larger composting operations where (1) mixing with a loader is impractical, or (2) requires precise mixtures of carbon and nitrogen according to compost recipes.  The paddle mixer, pugmill mixer, and rotary drum mixer are the most common compost mixers.  The units may be stationary or mobile, and may be powered electrically or by diesel engine.  Some pieces of equipment designed for mixing other products such as animal feed can be used to mix compost.</P>

<P> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills by an average of 15.9% (EPA, 1994).</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using compost mixers deal with the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically trained in the proper operation of the mixer.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used if needed.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Thorough mixing speeds up the composting process by making nutrients available to microorganisms</P>

<P><li> Fast, efficient mixing of compost materials compared to mixing with a loader</P>

<P><li> Can handle high volume of materials</P>

<P><li> Breaks up clumps of material that can become anaerobic and odorous in the compost pile</P>
</ul>
<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>None</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Compost mixers cost from $30,000 to $60,000 for units that process from 20 to 40 tons/hr.  Maintenance costs are approximately $500/yr excluding labor.  Compost mixers are available as either stationary units with an electric motor or mobile units with a diesel engine.  The ecomomic analysis is for an aerated static pile compost operation.  The capital costs include compost pads with air lines, blowers, a tub grinder, compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loaders, and offices.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Portable concrete/asphalt crushers are typically used at construction sites or landfills to crush chunks of concrete or asphalt into small pieces.  This crushed material may then be recycled for use in other construction applications.  Crushing is usually performed in two steps; a primary crusher reduces the larger incoming debris, and a secondary crusher further reduces the material to the desired particle size.  Magnetic ferrous metal recovery can take place after both stages.</P>

<P> The three main types of equipment are jaw, impact, and rolling crushers.  Jaw crushers are best suited to quickly reduce large or odd-shaped debris from construction/demolition projects to a manageable size.  Impact crushers are more effective than jaw crushers at freeing rebar encased in the rubble.  A rolling crusher is composed of two heavy cylindrical rollers and is used for secondary crushing.</P>

<P> Crushed concrete and asphalt can be re-used in new construction as road and railroad base material, fill, or pavement constituents.  In some applications, recycled concrete may be used in place of aggregate for drainage layers and sub-bases.  Other potential uses include ballast, sub-ballast, and trickling filter media for wastewater treatment plants.  Finely crushed concrete can be used as a neutralizing agent in a variety of applications.</P>

<P> Construction work at an installation is usually performed for a specific project and may not require year-round usage of a crusher.  In addition, it is possible to stockpile the material for extended periods of time, provided land is available for stockpiling.  Therefore, it may be appropriate to lease a unit as required.  There are also companies that will bring portable crushers on site, crush the material, and leave it for use at the base.  The fees will vary based on the contractor and the distance to the site.</P>

<P> This process produces no new waste streams.  With ferrous recovery, this process produces a second recyclable commodity.  The effect of this technology is to reduce the amount of construction debris to be landfilled.  </P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Asphalt is a moderate irritant and may contain carcinogenic components.  The dust from crushing concrete is a respiratory hazard.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE), including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and hearing protection should be used.  </P>

<P> Safety issues for using crushers concerns the operation of power equipment and respiration protection.  Operators should be specifically  trained to use the crusher.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.  Consult your safety office or local industrial health specialist prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Refining of waste petroleum lubricants allows the materials to be reused at a similar level of services as they were originally intended (i.e., reuse as a motor oil). As such, this is a higher level of recycling than recycling to recover the energy value of the waste petroleum. Currently, the EPA has identified four facilities that refine used oil solely.</P>

<P> Under this option, the waste oil generator contracts with an oil refiner or intermediate broker for disposal of waste oil. The broker/refiner will not normally accept less than full tanker truck loads of waste POL; therefore, on-site storage and accumulation will be necessary until sufficient quantities are generated. One advantage to this option is that all POLs can normally be combined into a single tank, including engine oils, petroleum-based hydraulic fluids, gear lubricants, and petroleum-based transmission oil.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Waste fuel may not be acceptable for mixing.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Care must be taken when handling waste oils due to high temperatures. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.  Consult your local health and safety personnel, prior to implementing this pollution prevention opportunity.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Refining of used oil is a higher use than any other option for used oil</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>  Onsite storage and accumulation is necessary until sufficient quantities         are generated</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Safety Kleen reports that they will accept truck load quantities of waste oil for $0.11 to $0.15 per gallon at the generator's site.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>Composting is a process that biodegrades aerobically organic material and with the production of heat destroys pathogens, producing a stabilized compost product for use as mulch, soil conditioner, and topsoil additive.  In-vessel systems can compost yard waste, food, sewage sludge, mixed wastes, and paper to produce a marketable, high quality product.  The materials degrade aerobically in a tank under optimum conditions.  This system is high technology compared to other composting methods, and requires precise temperature and oxygen control.  It is used in applications where land space is limited, and works very well for food waste (including animal products) and sewage that is often too messy or smelly for open composting.  Aerobic systems are used to compost mixed waste and other organics and produce bio-gas that can be burned for energy.  Anaerobic systems are typically used by municipalities and large facilities.  Pilot studies are essential to establishing design and operating parameters for in-vessel composting facilities.</P>

<P> Although carbon to nitrogen ratios and moisture content must be considered, the composition of feed materials is more flexible for selected in-vessel systems compared to windrow or aerated static pile systems.  This flexibility allows for different mixes to be composted, based on availability of feed materials.  The compostable materials must be screened or hand picked for non-biodegradable materials and then chipped, ground, or shredded into uniform particles that will decompose quickly.  Feedstock materials are mixed using a pugmill, front-end loader, conveyor or paddle-blade mixer to evenly distribute the carbon and nitrogen.</P>

<P> Oxygen and temperature are key environmental parameters that must be maintained within a specific range to provide optimum conditions for the microorganisms.  The temperature must be high enough to kill pathogens and weed seeds but not kill the microorganisms as well.  The method of air supply to the compost mix depends on the particular in-vessel system selected.  Generally, air is supplied by blowers and flows up through the compost.  Air can be supplied via piping networks or through damper arrangements beneath the compost.  Blowers can operate automatically based on measured temperature set points or set at regular intervals.  Pile temperature is controlled by cycling the aeration system on and off.  Good odor control for this system is achieved through collecting and treating the process air and building air.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Many in-vessel systems have never been operated with yard waste as a bulking agent.  A description of the desired feedstock should be discussed with the vendor to determine compatibility with the facility's goals for waste reduction.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Care should be taken when handling compost material.  If nitrogen is present in excess, ammonia gas will be released from the compost.  Ammonia gas has an extremely pungent odor at very small concentrations.  Ammonia at high concentrations is a severe irritant of the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin.  Personal protection equipment (PPE) may be required.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist and base safety office prior to implementing this  technology.  </P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste generated by an average of 15.9% while the addition of food waste will divert another 6.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Faster method of composting</P>

<P><li> Requires fewer operators than other composting methods</P>

<P><li> Materials handling systems are more efficient in design than aerated static pile and windrow composting systems</P>

<P><li> Some in-vessel composting technologies have considerable operational flexibility in feedstock composition</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Higher capital cost</P>

<P><li> Requires operator training</P>

<P><li> Requires maintenance</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> There is considerable variation in costs between the various in-vessel composting systems.  The cost of constructing and operating an in-vessel composting facility will vary from one location to another based on feed stock, odor control requirements, and site constraints.  The capital costs include compost pads, reactor, conveyors/compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loader, blowers, odor control systems, and offices.  The capital and operating costs are dependent on the volume of material processed.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Although plastic containers contribute only a small portion of the municipal wastestreams disposed in landfills, they have a market value and recycling saves energy and resources.  Plastic container recycling is currently being conducted for a wide range of plastic products, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene, and polystyrene.</P>

<P> In order to identify the type of plastic a container is composed of, plastic containers and other plastic products include a numerical code, within a triangle with arrows, molded directly on the container.  The numerical code, and the corresponding plastic composition is as follows:</P>

</TABLE>

<P> Recycling programs for polyethylene terephthalate and high density polyethylene plastics are well established in the United States and abroad.  Recycling programs for other plastic compositions have become more common in recent years.</P>

<P> Plastic recycling can be easily incorporated into an existing curbside or voluntary drop-off collection program for other recyclables such as aluminum cans.  To facilitate this process, plastic containers should be separated according to the composition of the plastic by base residents and personnel participating in collection programs.  The segregated plastic containers can either be transported to the recycler or in some cases arrangements can be made for the recycler to provide pick-up services.  For lightweight plastics such as polystyrene, baling the containers prior to transport is recommended.  Processing requirements for plastic containers vary, but generally the containers are rinsed, grinded, and extruded into pellets for re-sale to container manufacturers.  Labels do not need to be removed.  </P>

<P> Some restrictions apply to the recycling of plastics.  Most notably, recycled plastic cannot be re-used as a food container.  The only exception is co-extrusion, in which a virgin layer of plastic is used to line the inside of the container so that it only comes in contact with the food product.  Another restriction is the market for recycled plastics.  Clear plastic is preferred and depending upon the market demands, the need for colored plastics may be limited.  Recyclers may also be limited as to the type of containers that they can process.  In some cases, narrow neck bottles are preferred.  </P>

<P> A major component of shipboard solid wastes is plastic.  In recent years the Navy has made great progress in reducing plastic waste at sea.  This work was implemented after passage of the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987.  Specific actions include the implementation of a 3-day/20-day rule, which requires all ships to store food-contaminated plastics for the last 3 days and non-food-contaminated plastic waste for at least the last 20 days at sea.  This rule has resulted in a 70% reduction in plastic waste discharges at sea.  The Navy has also implemented supply system changes for over 350,000 items to reduce or eliminate plastic packaging.   This equates to over 475,000 pounds of plastic each year that will not be taken on board Navy ships.  The Navy has also developed a plastic processor, which compresses and sanitizes plastics waste for storage on board.  The plastic processor was approved for full production in January 1995. </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper personal protective equipment such as long sleeves and gloves should be worn when handling waste plastics.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the volume of waste disposed in landfills</P>

<P><li> Conserves energy and natural resources needed to produce new plastic containers</P>

<P><li> Reduces landfill disposal fees</P>

<P><li> Minimal processing equipment requirements</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> May not be economical to recycle small quantities of plastics</P>

<P><li> Training of waste generators will be required, so they can separate the wastes properly.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Plastic container recycling can easily be incorporated into residential and commercial/industrial recycling programs with a minimum of additional capital costs.  The same collection containers used for curbside collection of residential recyclables can be used for plastic collection.  Dedicated collection containers could be purchased for offices or other commercial/industrial areas to increase plastic recovery from the commercial/industrial waste stream.  Operating costs for recycling plastic would include labor costs for a coordinator/monitor, collection costs (if applicable), materials handling costs (e.g. separation of plastic by composition), and transportation costs to deliver the material, if pick up service is not arranged with the contractor.  These operating costs can be partially offset with reduced landfill disposal fees and revenue from the sale of the plastic.</P>

<P> Market prices for recycled plastic are currently $200 to $1000/ton from local recycling centers based on recent surveys in selected regions.  As presented below, a recycling program, dedicated only to plastic container recycling, is not likely to be cost effective unless large quantities of plastic containers are collected and sold.  This is primarily a function of the market price for plastic.  It will however be cost effective if incorporated into an existing program that includes glass and aluminum recycling.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Medium scale plastic container collection program: 2 tons/month</P>

<P><li> Purchase of 40 curbside recycling containers: $15/container</P>

<P><li> Purchase of one large collection bin: $500</P>

<P><li> Labor for collection/separation of plastic containers: 4 hrs/week</P>

<P><li> Landfill fee:  $25/ton </P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Windrow composting is a process that biodegrades aerobically organic material and with the production of heat, destroys pathogens, producing a stabilized compost product for use as mulch, soil conditioner, and topsoil additive.  The organic material is left to decompose outdoors, aided only by watering and mechanical turning for aeration.  This method is simple, non-intensive, has a very low capital cost, and is commonly used by farmers, municipalities, and waste processing corporations.  It is the slowest large scale method used to produce compost.  Windrow composting can be used to process yard waste, food, paper, and sewage sludge.</P>

<P> The process of composting begins with collecting, receiving, processing, and storing feed stock materials, followed by mixing and pile construction.  The compostable materials must be screened or hand picked for non-biodegradable materials and then chipped, ground, or shredded into uniform particles that will decompose quickly.  The high-carbon, dry wood and paper waste should be mixed in equal proportion with high-nitrogen, high moisture grass clippings and food waste to provide balanced nutrition for the organisms of decomposition.  Feedstock materials are mixed using a pugmill, front-end loader, or paddle-blade mixer to evenly distribute the carbon and nitrogen, and then formed into piles to decompose.</P>

<P> Oxygen and temperature are key environmental parameters that must be maintained within a specific range to provide optimum conditions for the microorganisms.  The temperature must be high enough to kill pathogens and weed seeds but not kill the microorganisms as well.  The process of decomposition produces heat, and the organic material itself provides insulation.  Oxygen is required for aerobic decomposition.  A well aerated and properly mixed compost pile should not produce unpleasant odors.</P>

<P> Compost is formed into long piles called windrows that are typically 1.5 to three meters high, three to six meters wide, and up to 100 meters or more in length.  Windrows can be placed directly on the soil or paved area.  The land requirement for a windrow composting facility is dependent on the volume of material processed.  Generally, all of the materials handling and pile building can be accomplished with a front-end loader.  The windrows can be aerated mechanically by turning with a front end loader for smaller operations or using a windrow turner.</P>

<P> Following the composting period, the windrows are broken down and reconstructed into curing piles for additional aging and drying of the material.  Curing compost stabilizes it to prevent odors or other nuisances from developing while the material is stored.  After curing, the compost can be screened to improve the quality of the final compost product, depending on the requirements of the compost buyer or consumer.</P>

<H3>Material Compatibility:</h3>

<p>A description of the desired feedstock should be discussed with the vendor to determine compatibility with the facility's goals for waste reduction.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</h3>

<p>Safety issues for composting primarily concerns the operation of power equipment and health issues concern working with decomposing organic matter.  Operators should be specifically trained to use the equipment and should not operate machinery if on medication.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye, hearing, and respiratory protection should be used if needed.  </P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste generated by an average of 15.9% while the addition of food waste will divert another 6.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Easy to implement and operate</P>

<P><li> Handles a large volume of material</P>

<P><li> Low capital costs</P>

<P><li> Less equipment and maintenance needed than other composting methods</P>

<P><li> Uses few resources</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires a lot of land for composting</P>

<P><li> Attracts scavengers</P>

<P><li> Often produces odors</P>

<P><li> Requires large buffer zones due to odor and vectors</P>

<P><li> May require a permit depending on size</P>

<P><li> May require processing of rainwater runoff</P>

<P><li> Compost can become anaerobic in rainy conditions</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The cost of constructing and operating a windrow composting facility will vary from one location to another.  The operating costs are dependent on the volume of material processed.  The use of additional feed materials, such as paper and mixed municipal solid waste, will require additional capital investment and materials processing labor.  The capital costs include compost pads, grinder, compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loader, windrow turner, and offices.</P>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>A waste analysis plan serves to standardize and optimize the required testing of wastes so that all wastes at a site are properly characterized prior to disposal in a simple and efficient manner. A waste analysis plan establishes the characterization frequency and analytical requirements to be satisfied for every identified waste at the installation and provides guidance for handling new wastes.</P>

<P>1. Responsibilities for Characterization Prior to Disposal:  The personnel that make decisions regarding waste characterization and disposal must be trained in the regulatory requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and must know who establishes and enforces those regulations in the generator's location. The applicable hazardous waste regulatory program could be operated by a regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by an EPA-approved state agency. In this data sheet, only references to federal regulations are provided. However, additional or alternative state regulations may apply. All state programs have the same basic regulatory requirements as the federal program, but may also have additional requirements. It is critical that state-specific regulations be reviewed before waste management plans are developed.</P>

<P>Waste management personnel must understand the details of the characterization requirements described below so that any required testing and analysis can be integrated into the waste analysis plan. In addition to determining if a waste is covered by the RCRA hazardous waste regulations, a waste's characterization must also be sufficient to determine what waste disposal options (neutralization or other treatment, landfilling, incineration) are available for that waste.</P>

<P>For any waste that requires sampling and testing to determine its characteristics, the following information must be developed:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> the required parameters for sufficient characterization,</P>

<P><li> the tools required for sampling,</P>

<P><li> the method used for sampling,</P>

<P><li> the holding time of the sample,</P>

<P><li> the laboratory analytical method to be used,</P>

<P><li> the degree of detail in the reporting data and quality control, and</P>

<P><li> the maximum allowable concentration of the parameters of interest for the desired means of disposal.</P>
</ul>

<P>2. Characterization by Generator Knowledge of a Listed Hazardous Waste:  The circumstances associated with the generation of each waste determine what means of characterization is required. First, the waste must fit the definition of solid waste stated in 40 CFR 261.2 and not fit the definition of any exclusions listed in 40 CFR 261.4. Excluded wastes may be covered by other regulatory programs, or may be allowable in the municipal solid waste stream if not prohibited by the local solid waste ordinance.</P>

<P>If a waste is a solid waste (by RCRA definition), it may be a &quot;listed hazardous waste,&quot; as specifically defined in 40 CFR 261 Subpart D (Parts 261.30 through 261.35). If the waste meets the definition of a &quot;listed waste,&quot; based on the circumstances of the generation of the waste, then documented generator knowledge may be enough for a sufficient characterization to satisfy all disposal requirements. This also applies to a mix of a &quot;listed waste&quot; and another type of waste (per 40 CFR 261.3 [a] [2]), and also to a waste that is derived from a &quot;listed waste&quot; (per 40 CFR 261.3 [c] [2]). An example of a derived waste is the ash that remains from a listed hazardous waste that burned.</P>

<P>Each individual listed hazardous waste is assigned one or more waste type designations, based on the criteria of being ignitable (I), corrosive (C), reactive (R), toxicity characteristic (E), acutely hazardous (H), or toxic (T). Based on these characteristics, EPA specifies four hazardous waste lists, described below.</P>
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR align=center>
<TD><b>List Name</b>
<TD><b>Designation</b>
<TD><b>40 CFR Citation</b>
<TR align=center>
<TD align=left>Non-specific Source Wastes
<TD>F List
<TD>261.31
<TR align=center>
<TD align=left>Specific Source Wastes
<TD>K List
<TD>261.32
<TR align=center>
<TD align=left>Discarded Commercial Chemical Products - Acutely Hazardous
<TD>P List
<TD>261.33(e)
<TR align=center>
<TD align=left>Discarded Commercial Products - Hazardous
<TD>U List
<TD>261.33(f)
</TABLE>

<P>In order to determine if a specific waste is included in one of these lists, the lists provided in 40 CFR Part 261 must be referenced. Acute hazardous waste includes not only the &quot;P List&quot; waste chemicals, but selected &quot;F List&quot; waste types marked in the regulation with an (H). (Note that rules for accumulating waste often have specific requirements to address acutely hazardous waste.)</P>

<P>The waste analysis plan should include an updated description of each specific source of listed hazardous wastes generated at the installation.</P>

<P>3. Characterization by Sampling and Analysis of a Characteristic Hazardous Waste:  If a waste is a solid waste (by RCRA definition), but does not meet the definition of any of the &quot;listed hazardous wastes,&quot; it may still be considered a hazardous waste if the material exhibits any of the characteristics as defined in 40 CFR 261 Subpart C (Parts 261.20 through 24). Sampling and testing are required to determine the following hazardous characteristics:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Ignitability (RCRA code D001)</P>

<P><li> Corrosivity (RCRA code D002)</P>

<P><li> Reactivity (RCRA code D003)</P>

<P><li> Toxicity (RCRA codes D004 through D0043)</P>
</ul>

<P>The suggested sampling procedures to create a representative sample of different specific waste forms (such as drummed liquid, saturated soil, etc.) are provided in an EPA guidance manual titled <I>Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes</I>, EPA document SW846. The specific analytical laboratory testing methods for each hazardous characteristic are specified in 40 CFR 261 Subpart C by specific references to SW846.</P>

<P>To develop a waste analysis plan, a standard method of sampling and laboratory analysis for each waste should be selected based on the guidance provided in SW846 (or other applicable EPA guidance manuals) and the background knowledge of the generator. Every analysis does not have to be performed for every waste if the generator can provide documented support that certain compounds are unlikely to be present.</P>

<P>4. Determining the Frequency of Characterization:  Per 40 CFR 264.13 (a)(3), &quot;Waste analysis must be repeated as often as necessary to ensure that it is accurate and up to date.&quot; This means that an analysis of a waste is necessary whenever any of the following circumstances occur:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> the generator is aware of a change in the process that produces the waste,</P>

<P><li> the generator is aware that a waste was tainted by inadvertent mixing with another waste,</P>

<P><li> the receiving TSD facility determined through analysis that the waste no longer matches the expected characteristics, or</P>

<P><li> there is a change to the hazardous waste regulations that apply to that waste.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<P>The development and correct use of a waste analysis plan can:</P>

<P><li> Help to avoid the unnecessary expense of disposing of non-hazardous wastes using hazardous waste disposal methods or contractors</P>

<P><li> Help to avoid regulatory violations that can result in large fines and negative public exposure for the mismanagement or improper disposal of hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Minimize the time and money required for sufficient characterization of wastes and selection of proper disposal methods</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The secondary use of acids and alkalis as treatment chemicals in an Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) is a feasible waste reduction method, effectively reducing the disposal of used or excess acids and alkalis.  The secondary use of acids and alkalis can reduce problems associated with disposal of acid and alkali wastestreams, such as the high cost and the liability of normal waste disposal.</P>

<P> Activities generate appropriate secondary use acids and alkalis from expired shelf-life material, pickling baths, rinsewaters, metal plating operations, battery shop effluents, and boiler cleaning operations. These acids and alkalis can replace treatment chemicals such as sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide in chromic reduction, cyanide oxidation, metal precipitation, and neutralization processes in an IWTP.</P>

<P> Prior to implementing an acid and alkali secondary use program, regulations require that a shop area be serviced by the IWTP in order for the activity to participate in a secondary use program. Participating activities must strictly segregate all acids and alkalis and test them to establish viability of each wastestream.  In addition, the IWTP processes must be evaluated to ensure that the addition of the secondary use material to the wastewater will not interfere with the present design and operation of the treatment plant. Similarly, the program must operate without disrupting normal shop operations.</P>

<P> If use of the material is feasibility, the lab establishes mixture ratios for the plant operators. The plant operator then uses the secondary use acids and alkalis in the batch processing of wastewater.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The IWTP should not use secondary use acids and alkalis for the final pH adjustment prior to discharge due to the amount of metals found in many of the wastestreams. The IWTP should keep in stock sufficient commercial process chemicals for use during waste shortages and for final neutralization.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The safety and health concerns vary with the type of acids/alkalis chemicals being used. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.  Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>The secondary use of acids and alkalis in the IWTP eliminates the need to dispose of these materials as hazardous waste. It also reduces the amount of commercial chemicals kept on hand and the problems associated with the purchase and storage of these chemicals.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Prior to implementing an acid and alkali secondary use program, regulations require that a shop area be serviced by the IWTP in order for the activity to participate in a secondary use program.</P>

<P><li> The IWTP should not use secondary use acids and alkalis for the final pH adjustment prior to discharge due to the amount of metals found in many of the wastestreams.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> A substantial savings results from the secondary use of acids and alkalis. The purchases of commercial chemicals will drop, as will the amount of used/excess material requiring disposal, resulting in a substantial cost savings. According to one report, reuse of acids and alkalis in an existing IWTP required an initial capital investment of $45,000 and had a payback period of 7 months.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Glass pulverizing converts any waste glass (e.g., bottles, window panes, windshields) into usable aggregate products.  The consistency of these products may range from coarse sand to fine gravel.  Pulverized glass can be used in many ways, such as an aggregate substitute for gravel and sand, as well as for glassphalt (e.g., glass/asphalt mixes), turf and soil amendment, decorative landscaping, water filtration media, and sandblasting.  Pulverized glass is also a convenient method of storing and transporting glass for recycling.  A glass pulverizer is useful when large amounts of waste glass are generated.  </P>

<P> Typical glass pulverizer systems consist of a glass pulverizer, trommel screen/separator, and metering surge hopper.  The capacity of the glass pulverizer ranges from less than one to 20 tons per hour.  The trommel screen capacity ranges from three to 20 tons per hour, and the metering surge hopper capacity ranges from two to four cubic yards.  The system pulverizes glass and separates caps, metal, or plastic from the glass material.  Glass pulverizing systems are available in both stationary and mobile models.</P>

<P> The recycling of glass produces no new waste streams.  The effect this technology has on pollution prevention is to reduce glass disposal in landfills.</P>

<P> In March 1995, a glass pulverizer was purchased for use at Lajes Field, Azores, Portugal, to crush glass bottles generated on base.  The crushed product is expected to be used as a substitute for sand on the base.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using pulverizers deal with the operation of power equipment and respiratory protection.  The dust from glass crushing is a respiratory hazard.  Proper personal protective equipment including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and hearing protection should be used.  Operators should be specifically trained to use the crusher.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.  Consult your safety office or local industrial health specialist prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Removes glass from the waste stream</P>

<P><li> Increases the convenience of storing and transporting recyclable glass</P>

<P><li> Provides an aggregate for paving or construction</P>

<P><li> Equipment is usually light, portable, and easily moved to another location</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Glass pulverizing units usually require relatively high levels of maintenance owing to the abrasive nature of the processed glass</P>

<P><li> Equipment capital costs can be high</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Application:  At one to five tons/hour (includes glass pulverizer, trommel screen, and metering surge hopper); capital cost are $36,000; operating cost  would include labor, electrical costs, and maintenance.</P>

<P> Application:  At five to 10 tons/hour (includes glass pulverizer, trommel screen, and metering surge hopper); capital cost are $51,300; operating cost would include labor, electrical costs, and maintenance .</P>

<P> Application:  At 15 to 20 tons/hour (includes glass pulverizer, trommel screen, and metering surge hopper); capital cost are $68,000; operating cost would include labor, electrical costs, and maintenance.</P>

<P> Alternate application (capital cost for glass pulverizer only):  At one to five tons/hour = $16,400; at five to ten tons/hour = $26,825; at 15 to 20 tons/hour = $38,000.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> 1 to 5 ton/hour glass pulverizer: $16,400</P>

<P><li> Solid waste disposal costs: $30/ton</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Carbon adsorption is a process in which a contaminated waste liquid or vapor phase waste stream is treated by removing the targeted contaminant (the adsorbate) through contact with a solid surface (the adsorbent). Activated carbon which has been processed to significantly increase the internal surface contact area, is widely used in many applications as the adsorbent material. Use of different raw materials (e.g., coal, wood, coconut shells) and processing techniques has resulted in a range of carbon types, in both powdered and granular forms. These types have various adsorption characteristics which tend to make them better suited for specific environmental applications. Granular activated carbon (GAC) is most commonly used for removal of a wide range of toxic organic compounds from contaminated groundwater, industrial wastewater, and vapor phase waste streams. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is used extensively in biological waste treatment systems, and typically involves different handling and disposal practices than those used for GAC systems.</P>

<P>Activated carbon waste stream can be classified into a variety of possible categories, including both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The handling and disposal of activated carbon waste streams can pose a significant economic and logistical burden on the waste generator.  The incentives for recycling spent activated carbon wastes include financial benefits and reduced liabilities associated with improper handling or disposal of the activated carbon waste stream.</P>

<P> There are companies which offer activated carbon recycling services as part of an overall service arrangement or as a stand-alone service. The specific service offered will depend on such factors as the characteristics of the GAC treatment system, the volume of spent carbon to be handled, and the capabilities of the selected vendor. Spent carbon waste can be handled in either bulk shipments via tanker truck or rail cars, or in drums or alternative containers. Virtually all spent carbon waste to be regenerated is processed using a thermal destruction/scrubbing system, which destroys the organic contaminants as well as regenerates the carbon for reuse. Some vendors which offer activated carbon regeneration services will segregate the waste batches handled from each customer, if required, while other vendors will &quot;blend&quot; together waste carbon batches from multiple customers prior to processing. This can be an important factor if a customer is interested in minimizing liability associated with mixing and disposal of their waste stream with other unidentified wastes from other sources.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Activated carbon may contain toxic impurities that can be irritating to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>There are many benefits that can be attained through recycling spent activated carbon. Recycling carbon eliminates the cost, handling, and related liabilities associated with spent carbon disposal at off-site facilities. Recycling activated carbon will also significantly reduce the volume of fresh carbon that must be purchased to regenerate the system.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Regeneration of PAC is typically not practical.</P>

<P><li> If carbon is contaminated with PCB&#146;s, dioxins, heavy metals, or DCBP (dichlorobromopropane), regeneration may not be an option.</P>

<P><li> Special packaging may be required if carbon has certain chemical properties (ex. 2&lt;pH&lt;11, haylide and sulfur contamination, etc.)</P>

<P><li> Not economically feasible to regenerate on-site unless more than 400,000 pounds of spent AC is generated per year.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> It is recommended that activated carbon be purchased from a virgin activated carbon supplier that will accept the spent carbon for regeneration.  Typically, AC sample analysis and shipping fees are paid by the user, however, there is no charge for regeneration.  The economics associated with recycling spent activated carbon will vary based on the volume, system characteristics, contaminants, and handling mode (i.e., bulk or packaged units).</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Vermicomposting is a process that uses red earth worms to consume organic waste, producing an odor-free compost product for use as mulch, soil conditioner, and topsoil additive.  Naturally occurring organisms, such as bacteria and millipedes, also assist in the aerobic degradation of the organic material.  Vermicomposting is especially useful for processing food waste since the worms consume the material quickly and there are fewer problems with odor.  Vermicomposting does not generate temperatures high enough to kill pathogens.  For this reason, vermicomposting is more appropriate for food, paper, and yard waste only.  In some states, vermicomposting is considered as an animal raising, rather than a composting activity, and is exempt from the composting permitting process.</P>

<P> Organic material should be chopped or shredded for faster degradation.  Unprocessed materials can be used in vermicomposting, but the time required for complete degradation of the organic waste is generally six months or longer.  Vermicomposting does not require a balanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio like traditional aerobic composting methods.</P>

<P> One large scale vermicomposting operation processes approximately five to six tons of food waste and over two tons of yard waste per day.  This operation uses a raised, 120-foot long bed or trough that is 2.5 feet deep and 8 feet wide, with a mesh floor.  The operation is enclosed within a greenhouse type structure.  An adapted manure spreader makes a daily pass over the trough, spreading roughly three inches of prepared organic materials per day.  The worms castings are mechanically scraped off the bottom of the screen and collected.  It takes approximately 21 days to make earthworm castings using this method.</P>

<P> Another large-scale proprietary vermicomposting system called the &#147;Vermiconversion System&#148; uses thermophilic composting (for pathogen destruction and weed seed neutralization) for three to 15 days, and then places the composting material in vermiprocessing beds or windrows for an additional 30 days.  Two to four inches of new material are applied to the rows every other day, not exceeding a total row height of three feet.  The beds or windrows can be built on a sloped plastic liner for water reclamation, and utilize aeration piping and a sprinkler to maintain proper oxygen and moisture levels.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> If the compost contains food waste and animal products, it should be handled with gloves and care should be taken to wash hands and clothing after processing it.  It might be necessary to wear a mask when turning and working with compost to prevent inhaling bacteria or particles.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Complete composting of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste generated by an average of 15.9% while the addition of food waste will divert another 6.7% (EPA, 1994)</P>

<P><li> Vermicomposting produces a more marketable compost which is nutrient-rich with a smaller particle size, lower odor, and greater nutritional value than other types of compost</P>

<P><li> Vermicomposting has a less stringent permitting process</P>

<P><li> It produces compost quickly</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires more management and maintenance than other composting systems to meet the needs of the worms</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The estimated capital cost for a large-scale facility processing approximately 10 tons/day (2,500 to 3,000 tons/yr) of food and yard waste is approximately $30,000 to $40,000 for a basic reactor system, not including land costs.  The cost of materials processing equipment will vary depending on the type of equipment selected.  Operating costs may run $40 to $60/ton (including labor, benefits, maintenance, fuel, administration, etc.).  Alternatively, a 200 ton/day facility using the Vermiconversion System (thermophilic composting followed by vermicomposting) was recently implemented for capital cost of approximately $2,000,000.  </P>

<P> For large-scale vermicomposting, cost savings can be incurred from using the compost for base landscaping and/or selling the compost product as well as decreased landfill disposal costs.  These cost savings will vary from one location to another.  Annual cost savings have been estimated at $30,000 to $60,000 (for facilities producing around 5,000 tons/yr of compost) due to avoiding disposal fees and fertilizer and topsoil purchases.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>

<P><li> Produce 2,000 tons/yr of finished compost</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A trommel is a rotary cylindrical screen that is typically inclined at a downward angle which, combined with the tumbling action of the trommel, separates materials of different density.  Trommel screens are used to separate commingled recyclables, municipal solid waste components, or to screen finished compost from windrow and aerated static pile systems.  </P>

<P> Trommel screens are used by material recovery facilities to separate compostable paper from glass and other contaminants in previously shredded municipal solid waste.  Smaller trommels have been used to separate labels and caps from crushed glass.  Some trommels are designed to let paper pass through the screen while diverting heavier materials to re-crushing or a landfill.  Other applications require multi-stage trommel screens which have meshes or plates of different aperture sizes.  These screens may be used for the separation of commingled wastes with components of various sizes.</P>

<P> In composting applications, trommel screens are used to enhance the market value of finished compost by separating large particles and non-degraded bulking agents such as wood chips from the organic fines.  The fines are used or sold as a soil amendment and the bulking agent can be re-used.  Trommel screens are used when a high quality end product is desired.</P>

<P> The factors that influence the separation efficiency of trommel screens are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Characteristics and quantity of the incoming materials</P>

<P><li> Size, proportions, and inclination of the cylinder screen</P>

<P><li> Rotational speed</P>

<P><li> Clogging of screen openings</P>

<P><li> Size and number of screen openings</P>
</ul>

<P> The types of trommel screens available range from electrically or hydraulically stationary units with or without conveyors and hoppers to electrically or hydraulically self-contained, portable or mobile units with conveyors, cleaning brushes, and variable speed trommel drums.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for using trommel screens deal with the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically  trained to use the trommel screen.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) including gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection should be used if needed.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Allows recovery of recyclable and compostable wastes from mixed waste stream</P>

<P><li> Produces a high quality compost product for use in landscaping</P>

<P><li> Produces a more marketable compost product that has higher value</P>

<P><li> Allows reuse of compost bulking material</P>

<P><li> Compost reduces the amount of waste to be disposed.  Complete recovery of yard waste will reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills by an average of 15.9% (EPA, 1994)</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Trommel screens which process material in the range of 50 to 100 cubic yards/hour range in cost from $50,000 to $180,000.  The ecomomic analysis is for an aerated static pile compost operation.  The capital costs include compost pads with air lines, blowers, a tub grinder, compost mixer, trommel screen, front end loaders, and offices.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Process 25,000 tons/yr of wood and yard waste</P>

<P><li> Produce 15,000 tons/yr of finished compost</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> &#147;Total cost assessment (TCA)&#148; is a method to eliminate unjustified and misleading financial barriers in consideration of pollution prevention processes and projects. The TCA method&#146;s focus is on the &#147;true&#148; profitability of proposed projects and differs from conventional financial analysis in four ways:</P>

<ul>
<P><li> Cost, savings, and revenue summaries include indirect items like compliance, training, testing, liability, and affect on product and corporate image, all typically neglected from project analysis.</P>

<P><li> Costs and savings are directly allocated to specific process and product accounts rather than to overhead accounts.</P>

<P><li> Time horizons for calculating returns on investment are extended to capture longer-term benefits.</P>

<P><li> Other profitability measures include the time value of money for evaluating long-term costs and savings.</P>
</ul>

<P>Using the TCA method, the Tellus Institute has completed several major studies including 1) a study for the EPA Division of Pollution Prevention entitled, &#147;Total Cost Assessment: Accelerating Industrial Pollution Prevention through Innovative Project Financial Analysis,&#148; and 2) a study for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy entitled, &#147;Alternative Approaches to the Financial Evaluation of Industrial Pollution Prevention Investments.&#148; Furthermore, Tellus has incorporated the TCA method into its software, &#147;P2/FINANCE.&#148;</P>

<P>P2/FINANCE is spreadsheet software designed to guide companies in data collection and rigorous financial evaluation of potential pollution prevention projects. As a starting point or a complement to a company&#146;s existing project evaluation procedure, P2/FINANCE assures that pollution prevention projects have accurate financial representation and receive due consideration when capital budgeting is done. In addition, the program can compare the costs of current practices to various alternatives based on a number of criteria: liability, cost, debt, interest and tax rates, inflation, and depreciation.</P>

<P>The program is available in either Microsoft Excel 4.0 or Lotus 1-2-3 for MS-DOS 3.1 (or higher) formats, and comes complete with a User&#146;s Manual and user support, if desired. A mouse and color screen are optional, but do simplify operation of the program. For larger groups and organizations, one day training on TCA and P2/FINANCE is available.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> It is possible to recycle used lubricating oils generated from fluid changeouts of internal combustion engines in tactical service (MIL-L-2104) and in administrative service (MIL-L-46152), steam turbine and gear oil (MIL-L-17331), marine diesel service (MIL-L-9000), petroleum-based 90W and 140W gear lube oil (MIL-L-2105), and vacuum and compressor oils.</P>

<P> On-site recycling options for used lubricating oil are limited to diesel fuel supplementation and burning as a boiler fuel supplement. Based upon a study performed at Red River Army Depot in 1993, oil could not be successfully reconditioned on site for reuse due to heavy metal contamination. In addition, re-additizing of treated oils by on-site processors is generally not recommended.</P>

<P> <B>Diesel Fuel Supplementation</B></P>

<P> The criteria that must be used in electing on-site recycling options involves the volume of used lubricating oil generated annually. Diesel fuel on-site use includes the volume of diesel fuel use (40,000 gal/yr is required to burn 2,000 gallons of used diesel lubricating oil at a 5 percent mixture ratio), volume of diesel lubricating oil generated, diesel engine warranty, and activity policy.</P>

<P> Facilities that consume large volumes of diesel fuel (40,000 gal/yr or more) can reclaim diesel-engine lubricating oil using a combination of filtration/coalescers and utilize the reclaimed product as a diesel fuel supplement (NIPER BO6803-1 DEC, 1987). This recycling option is attractive, because it eliminates the disposal of 2,000 gallons or more of used lubricating oil annually, and also reduces the purchase of diesel fuel by 2,000 gallons annually. When used in conjunction with a fast lube oil change system (FLOCS), a cost-effective on-site recycling option for used lubricating oil becomes possible. Among the three major diesel engine manufacturers, neither Cummins nor Caterpillar have restrictions prohibiting the use of used lubricating oil as a diesel fuel supplement, although Detroit Diesel does not recommend the practice. If the warranties of the diesel engines to be employed to consume the used lube oil or activity policy prohibits such use, this option should not be selected.</P>


<P> <B>Boiler Fuel</B></P>

<P> Used lubricating oils, including internal combustion engine, steam turbine and gear oil, petroleum-based gear lube oil, and mechanical pump oils, can be dewatered and filtered for use as a supplement to No. 6 burner fuel or used to fuel dedicated waste oil burners. To burn these used oils in a boiler, you may require a permit from the state which defines the source of the fuel. The boiler must be of a special design to burn used oil and must meet federal containment limits. Technically, the Navy can burn used lubricating oil, but in practice it is not done.</P>

<P> There is an increased boiler maintenance cost resulting from burning higher used lube oil as a supplement to No. 6 fuel oil. Any volume of used oil that is burned as a burner fuel supplement can be cost-effective, although if the blend of No. 6 oil with used lube oil exceeds 50 percent, the maintenance costs become a significant factor in Net Uniform Annual Savings.</P>

<P> Black Gold manufactures dedicated waste oil burners that are designed to burn high carbon content waste crankcase oils, lubricating oils, automatic transmission fluids, and No. 2 heating oils. Black Gold offers turnkey systems that include everything but the flue.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The six types of lubricating oil listed (L-2104, L-17331, L-46152, L-9000, and L-2105) can and should be combined for efficiency and economy of collection. Do not mix or blend low-flash hydrocarbons with used lubricating oil. It is permissible to collect hydraulic oils (H-5605 and H-17672B) with lubricating oils if neither are recyclable for original use and not contaminated with halogens.</P>

<P> These oils should be accumulated by the generator in clean, well-labeled, and color-coded drums. When the drum is full, the generator should complete a standard 1348-1 manifest form and request Public Works or other appropriate activity to transfer the drum to the central storage facility.</P>

<P> Storage of used lubricating and gear oils is necessary during the period required to accumulate a sufficient volume for recycling or disposal. Storage should be achieved in clean 55-gallon labeled drums, bowsers, buffaloes, above-ground tanks, or railroad tank cars. If drums are used, these should be covered so that water does not collect on top of the drum with possible contamination of the contents. Storage containers should be placed in an area that is bermed or diked to contain spills from reaching groundwater.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Care should be taken when handling lubricating oils. Proper personal protective equipment is recommended. Consult your local health and safety personnel for specific precautions.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Potential benefits of on site recycling of used oil are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li>  Reduced waste oil disposal</P>

<P><li>  Reduced diesel fuel and fuel oil purchases</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>  Due to heavy metal contamination, onsite reconditioning of oil for reuse        (for its original intended purpose) has not been successful</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> <B>Diesel Fuel Supplement</B></P>

<P> Racor Industries, Inc., Modesto, California, provides a unit designed specifically for processing used lube oil for use as a diesel fuel supplement. If permanently installed, it is generally used in conjunction with a fuel reservoir or tank. It automatically blends used crankcase oil with diesel fuel. It also filters, recycles, and transfers diesel fuel. It has its own waste oil holding tank and oil injection system.</P>

<P> The bare equipment costs to recycling used lubricating oil as a diesel fuel supplement are $8,500 to $10,000, and the total capital investment ranges from $57,000 to $80,000. These costs assume that tankage for the diesel fuel exists. The total capital investment includes installation materials and labor, training, and start-up materials costs. Payback period of these initial investment costs can be achieved in less than the estimated 10-year life of the equipment.</P>

<P> A brief summary of the economics of the option to recycle used lube oil as a diesel fuel supplement follows:</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Balers are machines that compact and bind recyclable materials.  A baler uses a hydraulic ram to compact material into a box shape.  Compressed bales are then tied with wire.  The baler can process paper, cardboard, corrugated boxes, tin or aluminum cans, plastics, or large metal components into dense stackable bales of a uniform material.  The bales reduce space required for storage and transportation, and can be moved with a forklift.  There is a wide range of sizes for balers.   Recycling facilities from small military bases to high volume municipal waste recovery facilities use them to prepare recyclable materials for market.  Some recyclables must be baled or they will not be accepted by the buyer.  </P>

<P> Balers may be fed by a gravity feeder, a mechanical conveyor, or an air feed system.  If the operation calls for the use of the same baler to bale more than one material type, the baler must be specifically designed to handle different materials at different ranges of capacity.  Tying bales with wire can be manual or automatic.  The number, size, and tension of the baling wires must be adequate for the particular materials baled.  Throughput capacity for a typical baler is 20 tons per day.  A baler produces no new waste streams.</P>

<P> The effect this technology has on pollution prevention is primarily to increase the ease of handling, marketability, and value of the recycled commodity.  It does not have a direct effect on the amount of materials recycled.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues deal with the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be trained to use the baler and exercise caution to keep limbs, clothing, and hair from being caught up in the hydraulic rams or feed hoppers.  Machinery should not be used if workers are intoxicated or on medication. gloves, eye protection, and hearing protection, should be used. Consult the base safety office and your local industrial health specialist to determine the proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and the necessary training prior to using this technology.Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using mechanized equipment.</P>

<P> For work performed in California, Title 14 of CCR Section 17512 requires daily cleaning of equipment, including bailers, at transfer and processing stations to prevent unsanitary conditions.  Other states may have similar regulations.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Enhanced marketability of commodity</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>The proper handling techniques for containers of hazardous wastes are defined within the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. Specific requirements depend on the available facilities, the volume of waste typically generated, and the desired mode of hazardous waste handling and transportation.</P>

<P> The personnel that make decisions regarding hazardous waste containers, labeling, storage, and transportation must be trained in the regulatory requirements of RCRA, and must know who establishes and enforces those regulations in the generator's location. The applicable hazardous waste regulatory program could be operated by a regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by an EPA-approved state agency. In this data sheet, only references to federal regulations are provided. However, additional or alternative state regulations my apply. All state programs have the same basic regulatory requirements as the federal program and should be consulted prior to establishing any procedures.</P>

<P> This data sheet addresses the generator's requirements for container type, marking, and labeling. For the purpose of this datasheet, an installation may have more than one waste-generating site.  Proper preparation of hazardous wastes for off-site transport must be performed by trained personnel in accordance with the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations provided in 49 CFR Subchapter C (Parts 171 through 177). Often times, the hazardous waste transporter will be responsible for providing compliance with 49 CFR 171-177.</P>

<P> 1. Container Storage</P>

<P> In general, hazardous waste may be stored in accordance with one of three sets of regulatory requirements. The requirements for an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; (also called a &quot;satellite accumulation area&quot;); the requirements of a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area;&quot; or the requirements for a permitted treatment, storage, or disposal (TSD) facility must be satisfied for each location where hazardous waste is stored.</P>

<P> Fulfilling the requirements for a TSD facility is a complicated and demanding task that is far beyond the requirements for storing wastes from a single waste-generating process at an installation with multiple waste-generating sites. By comparison, the requirements for an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; or a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; are much less complex and still provide an area that is suitable for many waste-generating situations.</P>

<P> The regulatory limit for accumulating hazardous waste at an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; is volume-based (no more than 55 gallons allowed, in most cases), while the limit for accumulating hazardous waste at a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; is time-based (no longer than 90 days of storage allowed, in most cases). When the corresponding limit is reached at either type of storage area, the waste must then be transferred. Hazardous waste from an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; can be moved to an on-site &quot;less-than-90-day storage area,&quot; or a permitted TSD facility. Hazardous waste from a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; can only be moved to a permitted TSD facility.</P>

<P> An &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; must be located at or near the waste-generating activity and be under the direct supervision of the operator of the activity. In accordance with 40 CFR 262.34 (c):</P>

<ul>
<P><li> No more than 55 gallons of hazardous waste or 1 quart of acutely hazardous waste may be accumulated at an &quot;initial accumulation area.&quot; There is no time limit on how long it takes for waste to be accumulated up to the volume limit.</P>

<P><li> Once the volume limit is exceeded, the generator must mark the hazardous waste container with that date, and transfer that waste out of the area within 3 days.</P>

<P> A &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must be located on site at the installation and be managed in accordance with the following requirements from 40 CFR 262.34 (a).</P>

<P><li> Any volume of hazardous waste can be collected and stored in acceptable containers or tanks (or drip pads, in the case of equipment that contains hazardous waste), providing no accumulated hazardous waste remains in storage for more than 90 days.</P>

<P><li> A container holding hazardous waste must always be kept closed during storage except when it is necessary to add or remove waste.</P>

<P><li> The container must not be handled in a manner which will cause it to leak.</P>

<P><li> If the container holding the waste leaks, the waste must be transferred to a new container.</P>

<P><li> The containers must be inspected at least weekly for leaks and signs of corrosion.</P>

<P><li> Containers holding ignitable or reactive waste must be located at least 50 feet from the installation property line.</P>

<P><li> Containers of incompatible waste must be separated by means of a dike, berm, wall, or other structure.</P>

<P><li> A &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must have communication, alarm, and fire-fighting systems in accordance with 40 CFR Part 265 Subpart C (265.30 through 37). This regulation also defines the required aisle space between containers.</P>

<P><li> A &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must have a contingency plan with established emergency procedures in accordance with 40 CFR Part 265 Subpart D (265.50 through 56).</P>

<P><li> The personnel that operate a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must receive training in accordance with 40 CFR Part 265.16.</P>

<P><li> A &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must have a waste analysis plan in accordance with 40 CFR Part 268.7(a)(4).</P>
</ul>

<P> If a container of hazardous waste is kept at a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; for the purpose of collecting small quantities of waste over time, the 90-day storage limit for that container begins with the original addition of waste. If a filled container of hazardous waste from an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; arrives at a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area,&quot; the 90-day limit for that container began when the volume limit of 55 gallons (or 1 quart of acute hazardous waste) was first exceeded at the &quot;initial accumulation area.&quot;</P>

<P>2. Container Selection</P>

<P> A container used to collect hazardous waste at an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; or a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; must meet the following requirements (per 40 CFR 262.34).</P>
<ul>
<P><li> The waste being placed in the container must be compatible with the container. The operator of the &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; can confirm the compatibility of a stored material and a container material by referencing any of a variety of handbooks or manuals on the subject, such as Table 23-3 of the <I>Chemical Engineering Handbook</I> by Perry and Chilton. The MSDS may also be helpful in identifying suitable storage conditions. Under many circumstances, the only commonly handled wastes not compatible with a steel container are highly corrosive wastes, such as waste acids, which must be stored in a plastic or plastic-lined container.</P>

<P><li> If wastes from more than one specific source are intended to share the same container, and mixing of the wastes does not violate applicable disposal requirements, then the compatibility of the mixed wastes with each other and the compatibility of the mix with the container must be confirmed prior to this type of storage. Similarly, a waste can not be stored in a container that has previously stored a different waste with which it is incompatible.</P>
</ul>

<P>3. Container Labeling</P>

<P> For an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; (per 40 CFR 262.34 [c]):</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Containers must be marked with the words &quot;Hazardous Waste&quot; and with other words which identify the contents of the container.</P>
</ul>

<P> For a &quot;less-than-90-day storage area&quot; (per 40 CFR 262.34 [a]):</P>
<ul>
<P><li> The storage container must be labeled with the words &quot;Hazardous Waste&quot; and a description of the waste.</P>

<P><li> Containers that accumulate waste while being stored must be clearly marked with the date when the container began accumulating waste.</P>

<P><li> Containers that arrive from an &quot;initial accumulation area&quot; must be clearly marked with the date when the container became full.</P>
</ul>

<P>4. On-Site Movement of Containers</P>

<P> As stated in 40 CFR 263.10 (b), &quot;These regulations [for permitted transportation of hazardous waste via air, water, or public highway] do not apply to on-site transportation of hazardous waste by generators or by owners or operators of permitted hazardous waste management facilities.&quot; However, it is recommended that standard safety guidelines for the handling of hazardous waste be implemented for on-site transportation activities. Typical standard operating procedures are as follows.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Prior to transport, the hazardous waste container must be completely closed and sealed. Bungs must be tightened, and lids must be in place with bolt rings tightened.</P>

<P><li> Prior to transport, the container must be inspected to ensure that it can be safely transported without risk of spills or leaks. If a container is damaged, corroded, or otherwise structurally inadequate, the waste must be transferred to a new container or placed in an approved overpack drum prior to moving.</P>

<P><li> The transfer of a container between an area and a vehicle must be accomplished using appropriate equipment in a way as to minimize the possibility of an accident or spill.</P>

<P><li> Other installation-specific documentation may be required at the time of transfer.</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>Printed circuit boards are a common component of many electronic systems built for both military and commercial applications. Printed circuit boards are typically manufactured by laminating dry film on clean copper foil, which is supported on a fiberglass plate matrix. The film is exposed with a film negative of the circuit board design, and an etcher is used to remove unmasked copper foil from the plate. Solder is then applied over the unetched copper on the board. Depending upon the use and design of the particular printed circuit board, various other metals may be used in the manufacturing process, including lead, silver, gold, platinum, and mercury. Printed circuit boards are potentially a difficult waste material to process, since they generally have no usefulness once they are removed from the electrical component in which they were installed, and they typically consist of materials that classify them as a hazardous or &quot;special&quot; waste stream. They must be segregated and handled separately from other non-hazardous solid waste streams. Printed circuit boards that are handled as waste materials must be processed using any one of several available disposal options. Not only are these options expensive, they require a significant amount of effort and handling by the generator. Furthermore, since some of these disposal options do not include destruction of the waste circuit boards, the generator also retains much of the liability associated with improper handling or disposal.</P>

<P> As an alternative to off-site disposal, printed circuit boards can be handled and processed to recover the value of the raw materials that are used to produce the boards. There are several companies that offer recycling services as an alternative to off-site disposal of obsolete printed circuit boards. These services will generally process the boards by systematically removing raw materials of value from the board matrix. This includes metals such as silver, lead, copper, and gold. Depending upon the volume and characteristics of the printed circuit boards processed through a particular vendor, the raw materials will be recovered and the salvage value returned to the generator.</P>

<P> Typically, the vendor will provide a waste material profile form, which will be used by the generator to describe the nature, quantity, and additional characteristics of the circuit boards to be processed. Once the vendor approves of the processing arrangement, the generator will prepare the circuit boards for shipment. The handling and transportation methods used will depend on the volume of material, distance to be shipped, and vendor requirements.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>This should generally not be a consideration, since virtually all of the components of printed circuit boards are stable, solid materials when handled under normal circumstances. There may be some concern associated with printed circuit boards that contain unstable and/or toxic components such as mercury, certain forms of lead, and some electronic components that are attached to the boards. The waste recycling vendor should be contacted if there are any potential concerns regarding material compatibility which may be encountered during shipment or processing of the circuit boards.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are minimal safety and health concerns regarding circuit board recycling. For specific precautions consult your local health and safety personnel.</P>

<H3>Benefits:  </H3>

<p>Recycling printed circuit boards has various benefits including:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Recovered value of raw materials reclaimed from processing the circuit        boards</P>

<P><li> Savings resulting from the elimination of a potential hazardous waste or &#147;special&#148; waste stream</P>

<P><li> Reduction of potential generator liability associated with improper waste        handling and/or disposal procedures</P>

<P><li> Generators can boost public relations by publicizing efforts made to bolster recycling initiatives at their facilities</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>
<p><li>  Market value of the reclaimed metals can fluctuate abruptly</P>

<P><li>  Boards containing inherently toxic or hazardous materials such as mercury may have little or no recyclable value</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis: </H3>

<p>The economics of printed circuit board recycling will be determined by many factors, including the characteristics of the boards to be recycled, market value of the reclaimed components/raw materials, volume of boards being recycled, and conditions of the hazardous waste/solid waste market. Boards containing valuable metals, such as gold or silver, which can be readily reclaimed will be the easiest and most economically beneficial to recycle. Boards which contain inherently toxic or hazardous materials (e.g., mercury) may have little or no recyclable value and be precluded from consideration in a recycling program.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Shredders can be used to cut paper into approximately 1/2 inch strips to make it more suitable for composting or reuse as animal bedding or packing material.  The primary material processed would be non-recyclable paper such as food contaminated paper and waxed paper as well as paper from remote locations where recycling is not an option.  This process cuts the paper into strips which has the effect of reducing the fiber length.  This is undesirable for recycling; therefore, shredding would not be used in a recycling operation.  Paper shredded for security purposes can also be diverted for these alternate uses.  This finely shredded paper is sometimes not recyclable due to the reduction in fiber length.</P>

<P> This technology processes paper which would not be acceptable to traditional recycling operations and it produces no new waste streams.  The effect this process has on pollution prevention is to capture and recycle a waste stream normally missed in recycling operations.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Safety issues for shredders concerns the operation of power equipment.  Operators should be specifically  trained to use the shredder and exercise caution to keep limbs, clothing and hair from being caught up in the feed mechanism.  Machinery should not be used if workers are on medication.  Proper personal protection (PPE) used if needed.</P>

<P> Consult the base safety office and your local industrial health specialist to determine the proper PPE and the necessary training prior to using this technology.Consult the base safety office on proper protective gear and training prior to using equipment.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Permits composting and reuse of otherwise non-recyclable paper</P>

<P><li> Potential reduction of 31.7% of waste currently disposed by diverting all paper products from landfill disposal (EPA, 1994)</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Spent cutting fluids are generated by metal working operations.  The purchase and disposal of such fluids is becoming increasingly expensive.  Fluid recycling is a viable option for minimizing costs.  There are several modular systems available for on-site, batch recycle of metal working fluids.  These systems are designed to clean the fluids by removing solids, bacterial, and tramp oil contaminants.  These systems may incorporate filtration, centrifugation, pasteurization, oil skimming, and/or coalescence processing steps.  Water or fluid concentrate may be added to the reclaimed fluid to adjust the fluid concentration to the desired level.  The fluids are then returned to the machine sump or tank.  Fluid life can typically be extended by 40 percent.  Fluid-concentrate purchases are expected to be lowered by half or more.</P>

<P> Cutting fluid recycling systems based on the centrifugal removal of contaminants are available in sizes that will treat 60 to 300 gallons of cutting fluid per hour.  These systems includes pumps and hoses to permit fluid recycling directly from a sump or tank.  The system removes solids, tramp oil, odors, and controls biological activity.  Metallic fines and other solids can be removed down to one micron.  The units can be mounted on a cart with brakes to facilitate relocation of the recycler to various sites.  The units can be purchased with the following options: a self-cleaning centrifuge, a proportional mixer system, a heat exchanger/economizer, processing tankage, a clean coolant distribution system, and water de-ionizer.</P>

<P> Another type of modular recycling system collects, treats and recycles metal working fluids through the process of pasteurization and coalescence.  The module provides a central fluid collection point for bacterial control, tramp oil removal, and adjustment of fluid concentration.  The fluid is heated to 160 degrees F, which kills most of the bacteria.  The elevated fluid temperature improves removal of tramp oil by coalescence.  These units typically have basket filters; however, some units are available with additional filtration capacity.  This style of recycling system are available in models that can treat 12.5 to 125 gallons of cutting fluid per hour.  This style of recycling module is currently in operation at the Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</P>

<P> An alternative to the purchase, operation, and maintenance of recycling equipment by the shop is the use of mobile recycling services.  Mobile fluid recovery service are available that will perform the recycling on the generator&#146;s property.  Mobile services generally includes a truck-mounted fluid recycling unit.  Some of these services have the capability of processing fluid at a maximum rate of 300 gallons per hour.  The recycling process consists of filtering, pasteurizing, and centrifuging the spent fluid.  There is typically a minimum charge per visit plus a rate per gallon of fluid treated.  This technology was recently evaluated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and found to result in annual cost savings for small- to medium-sized plants.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> There are mild skin and eye irritation effects associated with these compounds.  Personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Extends fluid life thereby reducing the need to procure new fluid</P>

<P><li> Reduced labor and machine downtime (cleanout) costs</P>

<P><li> Saves costs by reducing the quantity of waste fluids disposed</P>

<P><li> Improves fluid and machine tool cleanliness and, thus, reduces operation and maintenance costs</P>

<P><li> The centrifuge recycling system is capable of processing any type of coolant or oil</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Runs on electric power</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The following cost analysis is based using a mobile recycling service.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Spent cutting fluid generation rate:  2 gal/hr, 4,212 gal/yr (about  35,150 lb/yr)</P>

<P><li> Percent of tramp oil from recycling (requiring disposal): 5%</P>

<P><li> Fresh make-up fluid required after recycling: 421 gal/yr</P>

<P><li> Recycling cost: $1.35/gal plus labor, transportation, and filters</P>

<P><li> Recycling requires 9 site visits per year</P>

<P><li> Recycling technician labor: 8 hrs/visit</P>

<P><li> Transportation costs: $200/visit</P>

<P><li> Filter costs: $100/visit</P>

<P><li> Disposal cost for spent cutting fluid (hazardous waste disposal):  $2/lb (includes transportation)</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B><B> </B>Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: Medium</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Hazardous waste disposal</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B><B> </B>N/A</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>Sorbents can be used for emergency spill response or added to wastes in a container at the time the waste is added to the container without requiring a permit.  Some sorbents can reduce the hazard associated with the waste sufficiently such that the waste can be handled and disposed as a non-hazardous waste.  </P>

<P> Wastes are considered hazardous if they are toxic, corrosive, reactive, ignitable, or are listed in the regulations.  Certain sorbents, used appropriately, will remove the hazardous properties of wastes.  Listed wastes treated with sorbents are still considered hazardous unless the sorbed waste is de-listed.  Sorbed wastes must be verified as non-hazardous, in accordance with applicable regulations, before being handled or stored as non-hazardous.  </P>

<P> Sorbents can work in two ways.  First to soak up the liquid so that the material no longer flows.  Secondly to render the hazardous constituents immobile or less mobile via chemical reactions, fixation, ion exchange, precipitation, neutralization or encapsulation.</P>

<P> Post sorbed material which meets the criteria for non-hazardous waste may be used as an aggregate in concrete or asphalt or can be disposed in a non-hazardous landfill.  Potentially up to 100% of a hazardous waste stream can be effectively rendered non-hazardous.</P>

<P> Sorbents have been used to render hazardous wastes non-hazardous at U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot - Parris Island, SC; Defense Logistics Agency, General Supply Center - Richmond, VA; and Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</h3>

<p>None</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</h3>

<p>Appropriate personal protective equipment must be worn while handling hazardous waste.  Sorbents may create airborne dust during handling.  Prolonged exposure to any excessive nuisance dust in a confined area may result in lung damage.  Consult your safety office or local industrial health specialist, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces amount of hazardous waste disposed</P>
<P><li> Removes liability associated with hazardous waste disposal</P>
<P><li> Sorbed material may be recycled</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Sorbed materials need to be tested to verify a non-hazardous classification</P>
<P><li> Regulations may limit using this approach for all hazardous wastes</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:
<BR>- Sorbent: $183/drum
<BR>- Hazardous waste classification tests: $150/drum
<BR>- Non-hazardous waste disposal: $25/ton

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>Ethylene glycol (CAS: 107-21-1)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Deicing fluids usually become diluted during application onto an aircraft as a result of precipitation or when ice on the aircraft&#146;s fuselage melts after the deicing fluid is applied. In this impure and diluted form, the deicing fluids cannot be reused and disposal can be costly since most of these fluids contain ethylene glycol, which is regulated as hazardous waste in some states.  Recycling of ethylene glycol deicers or substituting these deicers with more environmentally friendly products are feasible pollution prevention opportunities.</P>

<P>Substitution of environmentally-preferred propylene-glycol-based deicing solutions for ethylene-glycol-based solutions may help mitigate environmental problems. Ethylene glycol, long the standard component of antifreeze and deicing products, is a highly soluble chemical that greatly increases the BOD of receiving waters, and it is also quite toxic to mammals at relatively low concentrations. Propylene glycol actually exerts a higher BOD, but it is non-toxic; in fact it is a common additive to cosmetics, medical products, and pet foods. Use of propylene-glycol-based products represents the current best choice for aircraft deicing unless, of course, the mission can be delayed during inclement weather or heating systems (for example, infrared heaters) can be carefully deployed. The military specification covering aircraft deicing fluids is MIL-A-8243, which specifies two products: Military type I deicers that are propylene glycol based, and Military type II deicers that are ethylene glycol based (three parts ethylene glycol and one part propylene glycol). <B>The Military type I fluid is currently the deicer of choice, and should always be specified unless some very specific need requires the ethylene-glycol-based, type II solution</B>. (The Military types I and II are not the same, and should not be confused with the commercial S.A.E. type I and II fluids, which are formulated per Aerospace Material Specifications, AMS 1424 and AMS 1428, respectively.)</P>

<P> There are other options for replacing ethylene glycol (and propylene glycol) in certain applications.  The deicing products potassium, magnesium, sodium, or calcium magnesium acetates and urea pellets are better suited for airfield pavement application than the glycols, both of which are being phased out for direct pavement deicing. Isopropyl alcohol is also approved for airfield deicing, but is operationally limited, due to its high volatility which results in fumes that can be carried inside aircraft.  The preferred replacement products for airfield surfaces are the acetates because they are non-toxic and almost entirely biodegradable. Potassium acetate is formulated in a 50% solution and applied as a liquid. Sodium acetate is a granulated product that is applied to pavement in the same fashion as urea pellets. Urea products are still used, but they are not the products of choice because of the ammonia nitrogen&#146;s toxicity to aquatic life.  To eliminate the toxicity, somewhat complicated nitrification/ denitrification treatment is required for wastewater containing ammonia-nitrogen-rich compounds like urea. In addition, urea products are not as versatile as acetate products, especially for low temperature situations, due to the relatively high temperature to which urea depresses the melting point of ice, at best about 15&#176;F. Functionally, urea pellets are usually not applied when temperatures are much below 25&#176;F.</P>


<P> Some facilities contract with recyclers to recover and process glycol for reuse. There are two common recovery methods. The diluted glycol fluids are either concentrated using evaporation or membrane separation to enable their reuse as antifreeze agents, or they are concentrated and then purified using fractional distillation. The concentrated glycol solutions can be used where quality considerations are not important; for example, to spray onto coal so that it will not freeze in a railcar when ready to unload. The purified glycol can be used for blending with virgin feedstock to make new antifreeze and other new glycol-based products.</P>

<P>Because of the high BOD exerted by the glycols, they are not readily sewered either to surface water or to a wastewater treatment plant. Thus, if the spent deicing fluids can not be recycled easily or economically, they should at least be contained and collected to allow treatment and disposal. Some treatment options are available to handle spent deicing fluids; for example, biological degradation using a semi-continuous anaerobic process to convert glycols and low concentrations of any other organic contaminants, such as fuel, oil, or grease, into carbon dioxide and methane.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Propylene-glycol-based anti-freeze formulations should not be mixed with any other chemicals, anti-freeze formulations, or similar products made by different vendors without first carefully verifying compatibility. These products should also be stored in dedicated, labeled containers. Commercial S.A.E. type I (deicing attributes only, not shear sensitive) glycol deicing fluids are generally compatible with common materials of construction. Therefore, stainless steel, mild steel, lined steel, or reinforced plastic are acceptable. Piping and any ancillary equipment should also use only the same compatible materials. One incompatible material, galvanized steel, should never be used in any glycol service.</P>

<P>Commercial S.A.E. type II (shear sensitive fluid with anti-icing attributes) glycol fluids are also relatively compatible with common materials of construction, but have a slightly narrower range of material compatibility. Stainless steel or reinforced plastic are the preferred materials of construction for shipping or storage containers for commercial type II fluids by at least one vendor. However, mild steel can be used for commercial type II fluids, provided the container has a chemically resistant liner like polyurethane or phenolic epoxy resins. Piping and any ancillary equipment should also use only compatible materials, such as stainless steel or plastic.</P>

<P>Potassium acetate formulations should meet all the standards established under AMS 1432 for corrosion and materials compatibility. Its product formulation does contain some corrosion inhibitors which, when exposed to low alloy metal or steel surfaces, forms a barrier on the metal surface to prevent accelerated corrosion. To prevent depletion of the inhibitors, shipment and storage is recommended in plastic (polyethylene) or stainless steel containers. Shipment or storage in low alloy or steel containers can result in fluid degradation.</P>

<P>Granulated sodium acetate products should meet all the standards established under AMS 1431A. Granulated sodium acetate is typically supplied in polyethylene lined containers, but is also compatible with mild steel, as well as stainless steels, plastics, glass, and polyester-reinforced fiberglass.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Ethylene glycol is toxic to mammals if ingested and attracts animals because of its fragrant odor and sweet taste. Propylene glycol is non-toxic to mammals. Nevertheless, personal protective equipment such as chemical splash goggles, impervious gloves, and splash aprons should be considered for most handling operations. Consult your local health and safety personnel and the appropriate MSDS for specific precautions.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Substitution or recycling helps:</P>
<ul>
<P> <li> Reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated</P>

<P> <li> Save thousands of dollars in hazardous waste disposal costs annually</P>

<P> <li> Eliminate hazardous material cleanup costs associated with spills, leaks or soil and groundwater contamination</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Economics must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis after considering the unique variables of each site.  In general, the more dilute the solution and the larger the volume generated, the more feasible on-site recycling becomes. Other considerations include distance from the recycle facility, frequency of generation, storage availability, amount of coincident precipitation, cost of labor, and cost of real estate and site preparation.</P>

<P> Note: Comparisons with and evaluation of anti-freeze recycling equipment for aircraft deicing fluid recycling should not be made. Deicing fluids are always more dilute than anti-freeze solutions and contain different types of contaminants. Deicing fluids come in contact with external surfaces of aircraft and are likely to contain various soils, but no glycol oxidation products. Antifreeze can contain heavy metals, glycol oxidation products (primarily organic acids), and precipitated salts from prolonged use.</P>

<h2 align=center>Particle Counter for Determining Purity of Hydraulic Fluid</h2>
<p align=center><img src="/icons/tspiralc.gif">
<P>

<P><B>Revision:</B> 8/96</P>

<P><B>Process Code:</B> Navy:ID-14-04; Air Force: LA01; Army: LOP</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: High; Army: High; Air Force: High</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> The Patch Test (Filtration Testing) and its use of ODSs for Testing Hydraulic Fluids</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> N/A</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A particle counter tests hydraulic fluid quantitatively for contamination by shining a laser through a set quantity of the fluid and counting quantity and size of particles using a photo-detector.  The particle counter is a highly-effective, accurate, proven electronic technology.</P>

<P> Hydraulic fluid contamination testing for foreign particles or wear metal has traditionally been conducted using the patch test with CFC-113 (a Class 1 Ozone Depleting Substance [ODS] whose use is no longer allowed), Methyl Chloroform ( A Class 1 ODS), or Petroleum Solvent, as defined by federal specification PD-680 Type II.  The patch test is a 3 step process whereby hydraulic fluid is filtered using a filter (or patch), quick-dried using an evaporating agent, and subsequently read by a trained operator.  A particle counter is superior for two reasons.  First it eliminates the use of the drying agent (ODS or solvent).  Second, it takes the subjectivity out of the process and hence is a more consistently-accurate analytical method as compared to the patch test.</P>

<P> Elimination of ODSs leaves PD-680 Type II as the only approved solvent for use in patch tests.  While PD-680 Type II offers a satisfactory alternative, it is not an ideal solution.  Problems associated with using PD-680 Type II include increased drying time, use of inaccurate color standards, and subjective interpretation of those standards.  The end result is a more inaccurate, inconvenient, and time-consuming testing procedure for hydraulic fluid contamination.</P>

<P> Use of an electronic particle counter offers a viable alternative to the patch test that also produces a more accurate result.  This equipment requires no hazardous solvents, and test results are accurate and non-subjective.  Use of this technology is approved for Navy activities in the NAVAIR 01-1A-17 Hydraulic Manual.</P>

<P> Through a Navy-funded effort to eliminate ODSs and in conjunction with the Navy's Reverse Engineering Program (a hands-on effort to help field activities deal with rapidly changing environmental regulations), particle counters have been introduced to four prototype sites to completely eliminate the need for CFC-113 in patch tests to determine contamination levels of hydraulic fluids.</P>

<P> The goals of the hydraulic fluid contamination testing project were to eliminate the need for ODSs and to reduce the need for a patch test.  Subtasks of the project included reviewing the sampling frequency requirements, evaluating field replacements for the patch test, investigating alternate solvents, and prototyping at field level the most promising candidates.</P>

<P> Electronic particle counting has long been approved as a means of determining contamination of hydraulic systems, but has been a depot maintenance level practice due mainly to the cost and complexity of the particle counter equipment.  Bench-top and portable particle counting equipment was evaluated with the goal of finding an inexpensive portable unit suitable for deployment.</P>


<P> After investigation, it was determined that none of the portable units were developed enough for prototype at field activities.  Although rather costly, the HIAC Model 8011 or 8003 with the ASAP sampler benchtop particle counter appeared to be the best alternative.  After a successful two week initial prototype aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, four of the units (8011) we procured for prototype at four site (NAS Miramar, NAS Cecil Field, NAS Oceana, and USS Theodore Roosevelt), at a total cost of $71,000.</P>

<P> After several months in the prototype stage, the results have been extremely positive.  The sample turnaround time has proven to be well within requirements to maintain fleet readiness.  The relationship between patch test results and particle counter results has been acceptable.  The mechanics using the particle counter equipment are satisfied with its operation and prefer it use to the patch test.  The USS Theodore Roosevelt completed the transition to use of the particle counter during their 6-month, 1993 cruise.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> There are no materials compatibility issues with electronic particle counters.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Electronic particle counters have no special health and safety requirements for the user.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Removes any subjectivity of the patch test</P>

<P><li> Eliminates the use of ODSs or solvents</P>

<P><li> Viable alternative to the patch test</P>

<P><li> Technology has been in use for over 20 years</P>

<P><li> Particle counters count both number and size of particles providing quantitative results, thus providing a more accurate reading</P>

<P><li> Use of particle counters has reduced generation of hazardous wastes and procurement of hazardous substances</P>

<P><li> More accurate testing may lengthen the life of the vehicle</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Units must be kept in calibration to give valid results</P>

<P><li> Glassware used must be extremely clean</P>

<P><li> Cost of units</P>

<P><li> Portable units still in development</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The following cost elements are for electronic particle counters for determining purity of hydraulic fluid.  The economic analysis presented below is for a comparison of a typical patch test employing PD-680 solvent versus the particle counter method.  However, this cost analysis would be applicable independent of the solvent employed in the patch test.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Labor rate to operate particle counters (PC) and run Patch Test (PT): $30/hr </P>

<P><li> Tests per year: 500</P>

<P><li> Time to run tests: PC - one step 10 minutes/test; PT - two steps 20 minutes/test </P>

<P><li> Material cost: PC - clean glassware, PT - filters: negligible</P>

<P><li> Energy for PC and PT: negligible</P>

<P><li> Waste disposal: PC = negligible (used hydraulic fluid); PT = hazardous waste, $30/yr</P>

<P><li> System maintenance: PC - calibrate 2x/yr x $600/calibration = $1,200/yr; PT = negligible</P>

<P><li> Equipment costs: $19,850 less 7% GSA discount - $18,461</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Substitute lubricants that contain no or reduced amounts of lead, ozone-depleting compounds, or other hazardous or toxic substances are preferable over conventional formulations, because they reduce the consumption and disposal of these harmful substances.</P>

<P> Hazardous and toxic compounds should be avoided in products where possible, or a formulation that uses reduced amounts of these compounds should be employed. Product content is checked using the material safety data sheet (MSDS). In Section II of the MSDS, chemical components and their percentage (or range of percentage) of the product is presented. By comparing MSDSs for multiple products with the same MIL SPEC and NSN, a more environmentally friendly product may be selected. As a starting point, the list of hazardous and toxic compounds that should be avoided include the ozone-depleting compounds (ODCs) and the &quot;EPA 17&quot; list. Both of these lists are presented below.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The concerns vary with the type of lubricants being used. Proper personal protective equipment should be used, if needed. Consult your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to making a substitution.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The benefits of using environmentally preferable products are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li>  Reduced consumption of hazardous substances,</P>

<P><li>  Reduced worker exposure to hazardous substances, and</P>

<P><li> Wastes generated by product use may not be classified as hazardous wastes   </P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>  Substitute lubricants may cost more</P>

<P>   <li>  More of a substitute lubricant may be required to do the same job as the         original lubricant  </P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Economics depends upon the substitute lubricant chosen. An economic analysis should compare the cost of the environmentally friendly product to the previously used product. The analysis should account for different product consumption rates (i.e., used to take 1 ounce of spray, now it requires 2 ounces), and for different labor amounts required to use the product.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Recycling of spent antifreeze solutions is a viable alternative to disposal.  Waste antifreeze may be considered a hazardous waste in some states due to the toxicity of the ethylene glycol component, the toxicity of the products of degradation/oxidation of ethylene glycol, and/or the heavy metals content.</P>

<P> Several reclamation systems are currently available for on-site recycling of waste antifreeze.  Currently, there are two DOD-approved recycling systems (in addition to several other manufacturers of equipment, and also recyclers) for waste anti-freeze originally procured under MIL-A-46153.  One system uses ion exchange, and the other uses vacuum distillation as the primary separation/purification processes.  These systems filter solids from the spent antifreeze, as well as removing the metal ion contaminants from the solution.  The recovered coolant solution often requires blending with an inhibitor package to restore it to its initial state.  The two DOD-approved recycling systems work with either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol (not yet approved for use in military vehicles), but each must be processed separately.  These systems are relatively simple to operate, compact (~4&#146; x 4&#146;), portable (on wheels or can be mounted on a trailer or truck), and easy to maintain.</P>

<P> The distillation system produces the larger quantity of waste residue.  Residue production is approximately 3 gallons of residue per 75 gallons of spent antifreeze.  This residue is probably a hazardous waste since the lead contamination is often greater than 5 ppm, but only a Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure [TCLP] analysis can determine whether the waste has this hazardous characteristic.  The manufacturer of this unit claims that a batch of accumulated residue can itself be processed to further reduce the total volume of waste produced.  </P>

<P> The ion exchange unit does not produce any liquid hazardous waste residue; however, it does require filter replacement.  Spent filters accumulate metals and may be considered hazardous waste if disposed.  Once the ion exchange filters are spent they must be shipped back to the manufacturer for regeneration.  The spent filters are not generally treated as a hazardous waste since they are re-used after regeneration and are not disposed.</P>

<P> Off-site recycling of antifreeze is also currently available by using companies that specialize in this market.  Some of these companies charge for recycling and restoration of the antifreeze back to standard specifications so that it may be returned to the original user.  Other companies charge a handling fee, and recycle and restore the antifreeze to sell to other users.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Ethylene and propylene glycols are formulated so that they are compatible with most engine cooling systems.  Additives are included in the formulations to minimize metal corrosion and to inhibit formation of acidic compounds due to the high-heat operating conditions.  Some old formulations may not be suitable for use in systems containing aluminum.  Contact the original equipment manufacturer and the antifreeze manufactured for specific material concerns.</P>

<P> Glycol recycling equipment is designed to withstand the most severe chemical conditions of used anti-freeze.  However, special concerns or cases may require consultation with the manufacturer.  Follow manufacturer directions carefully when combining additives to bring the recycled glycol back to conformance with military specifications.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Heavy metal contaminants can be dangerous to human health.  They are potential carcinogens and teratogens, and skin absorption or ingestion is a major health concern.  Ethylene glycol can be irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.  It can also be toxic if inhaled.  Proper personal protection equipment is therefore recommended.  Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces coolant storage, transportation, and purchasing requirements</P>

<P><li> Minimizes production and storage of hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Protects the environment by reducing the amount of hazardous waste produced</P>

<P><li> Saves generators hazardous waste disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Reduces hazardous material cleanup costs or soil and groundwater contamination associated with spills and leaks from stored hazardous waste</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires controlled blending of additives to bring the recycled antifreeze back to meet military specifications</P>

<P><li> May require a hazardous waste treatment permit</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis: </H3>

<P> Recycling economics will vary, depending on whether on-site or off-site recycling is chosen and the amount of spent antifreeze generated.  Off-site recycling may not always have as large an annual savings compared to on-site recycling, however, the payback is immediate since there is no capital costs associated with this process.</P>

<P> In general, a one to three year paybacks can be expected for an average on-site installation.  Preliminary operating cost data with the two DOD-approved units seems to indicate that for comparable situations the ion exchange unit has a higher overall operating cost.  </P>

Since processing solutions have to be replaced on a regular basis due to shelf life expiration, tabletop units with smaller solution tanks consume less chemicals and generate less waste.</P>

<P> The chemistry for x-ray film development is proportional to the volume of film to be processed.  It takes a specific amount of developer and fixer to process the film, depending on the concentration of the critical element in either solution.  Fixer solution usage is controlled by the concentration of silver.  However, the developer solution has a short shelf life and will oxidize when expired.</P>

<P> The Agfa Model NDT M tabletop x-ray developer can develop film with a minimum length of 4 inches and a maximum width of 17 inches.  The unit includes developer, fixer, and wash tanks with a capacity of 1.7 gallons each.  Replenisher tanks for the fixer and developer have capacities of 8 gallons. The unit also includes a water filtration system with a cartridge filter and a drain collection system for collecting spent fixer, spent developer and rinse water.  At a given frequency or based on the volume of film processed, the fixer is drained for silver recovery or disposal.  The unit can process a maximum of 160 5&#148;x7&#148; films or a minimum of 30 14&#148;x17&#148; films per hour.</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Methylene Chloride (CAS: 74-87-3), Methyl Ethyl Ketone (CAS: 78-93-3), 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (CAS: 71-55-6)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Parts can be stripped of paint using aqueous chemicals at elevated temperatures.  These chemicals are biodegradable and can be discharged into the sewer system, virtually eliminating hazardous waste disposal costs.  However, certain hazardous constituents in the paint may contaminate the solution.  Check your local discharge regulations prior to disposing the contaminated solvent.</P>

<P> By using these chemicals in a hot tank, the elevated temperatures increase the stripping action by stripping paint as well as removing grease, oil, rust, and dirt.  The parts requiring stripping are immersed into the solution and then agitated to speed up the stripping process.  In conjunction with optional equipment such as filtration systems and skimmers, the chemical solution may be recycled and used again.</P>

<P> Most of the aqueous strippers are alkaline in nature.  These are different from acid strippers in that acid strippers may attack the metal parts, causing structural weakening (hydrogen embrittlement).  In addition, acid strippers normally require a neutralization process after stripping.</P>

<P> Hot tanks can come in a variety of sizes, from 100-gallon to 2,500-gallon capacities.  Most hot tanks have an agitating operation to accelerate the stripping.  With agitation, the mechanical force of the moving solution keeps washing newly formed emulsions and soaps away from surfaces while applying fresh chemical stripping agents to the newly exposed layers of paint, thereby speeding the entire action.  Most hot tanks have a temperature range from 180-210&#186;F.</P>

<P> Unlike the current practice of using a cold tank in conjunction with solvents, no solvent waste streams are generated with the hot tank using biodegradable cleaners.  Effluent waste streams associated with the use of hot tank aqueous strippers would be the aqueous solution and sludge products composed of paint, grease, oil, and dirt.  The aqueous solution may be recycled, or if it meets local sewer discharge limits, it may be discharged directly into the local sewer system.  Any sludge products generated would require proper disposal.  However, the use of hot tank/aqueous strippers eliminates exposure to toxic solvent vapors.</P>

<P> Hot tank/aqueous strippers are currently used the Army, Navy, Marine Corp, and Air Force.  They are used to strip paint from a variety of parts, including aircraft components.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Aqueous strippers used in hot tank paint stripping are compatible with most metals; e.g. iron, steel, magnesium, titanium, and stainless steel.  However, the aqueous solution may darken the metallic surface.  Also, some aqueous strippers cannot be used on metals such as aluminum, zinc, and tin.  The product container label should be consulted for metals compatibility.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Though biodegradable and environmentally friendly, the majority of the cleaners are corrosive and may cause burns to the skin or other parts of the body which they may come into contact with.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should be worn.  In addition, since the tank will be heated, caution should be exercised to prevent burns.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing thisany of these technologyies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Minimizes hazardous waste disposal</P>

<P><li> Eliminates exposure to known carcinogenic and neurotoxic solvents</P>

<P><li> Lessens paint stripping time</P>

<P><li> Meets environmental regulations regarding the use of ozone depleting substances (ODSs)</P>

<P><li> Spent wash solutions may be discharged into sewer systems if they meet the local discharge limits</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Not compatible with all metals</P>

<P><li> May require additional ventilation</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Mechanical cleaning processes are viable alternatives to traditional solvent-based cleaning operations.  Mechanical cleaning processes reduce waste production and eliminate potential safety problems with the handling and usage of toxic, ozone depleting, and often flammable solvents.  These cleaning processes are many and varied.  Cleaning of almost any piece of equipment, surface, or component is possible if it is sturdy enough to withstand the friction and force produced by the mechanical work of cleaning operations such as sanding, grinding, polishing, brushing, and scraping.</P>

<P> <B>Brushing</B> - Wire or plastic brushes are used to remove grime or grease buildup from equipment.  Metal and wooden surfaces can be prepared for painting or repainting by vigorous brushing of the surfaces to remove dirt, loose paint, scale, or corrosion.</P>

<P> <B>Grinding</B> - A rotating abrasive stone or disc is used to grind down some of the hardest and most difficult materials to remove like accumulated dirt, dry paint, long-standing corrosion, and mineral scale.</P>

<P> <B>Polishing and Buffing</B> - Light surface dirt, residue, tarnish, or scale is removed by polishing and buffing.  These operations typically use a soft device like a fabric or fiber cloth, and a slightly abrasive polishing cream to remove dirt, corrosion, scale, tarnish, oxidized paint, and grease residue from painted or bare metal surfaces.</P>

<P> <B>Sanding</B> - Sanding is an abrading operation using a fiber (paper, cloth, plastic, etc.) sheet embedded with sand or other mineral grit particles that removes surface dirt or loose paint.  It can be done manually or with a motor driven sander.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> These technologies are not meant to be used on precision or delicate parts.  Check with your local cognizant authority prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Significant reduction in the amount of hazardous waste generated compared to chemical stripping</P>

<P><li> Reduces hazardous waste disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Provides solvent cost savings</P>

<P><li> Reduces the number of hours required for paint stripping in comparison to chemical stripping</P>

<P><li> Reduces worker exposure to solvent, hazardous waste and hazardous air emissions</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Not appropriate for precision or delicate parts</P>

<P><li> Stripping rate varies with the type of paint, coating condition and coating thickness</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Costs associated with mechanical cleaning will vary on a case by case basis.  Cleaning rates are dependent on the equipment used and the thickness and type of coating or grime being removed.  Prior to full usage, performing a test case is recommended to ensure that the desired finish product is achieved.  The following cost estimate is for stripping paint from a T-38 aircraft:</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>  Aerosol cans are difficult to dispose when still filled with product.  There  are several devices on the market that can puncture aerosol cans that are  not empty.</P>

<P>  Aerosol can puncturing devices are available to safely puncture,  depressurize, and empty aerosol cans not completely discharged during  use.  The devices safely puncture the cans, capturing their contents and  emptying them for easy recycling or disposal.  Spray nozzles are typically  removed as well.  Puncturing is not required by law, nor is it considered  treatment; however, some regulatory agencies may consider an  unpunctured aerosol can to exhibit the characteristic of reactivity, as heat  or external pressure can cause detonation if the can is partially or  completely filled.  The law only requires the container to be &#147;empty,&#148;  where &#147;empty&#148; is defined as &#147;removing all wastes that can be removed  using practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of  container; and no more than 1 inch of residue remains on the bottom of the  container; or no more than 3% by weight of the total container capacity  remains within the container (if the container is &lt;110 gallons in size).&#148;   Furthermore, a container that has held a compressed gas is considered  empty when the pressure in the container approaches atmospheric.   Containers meeting these &#147;empty&#148; criteria are not hazardous waste and can  be disposed of as non-hazardous waste.</P>

<P>  In some states, like California, volatile organic carbon (VOC) venting is  regulated.  Since some propellants are frequently VOCs, for example  butane, the puncturing operation could result in release of these  compounds to the environment.  To address this problem some devices,  such as the AEROSOLV unit by Katec, provide an activated carbon  adsorption canister to capture any VOCs released from the punctured can.   However, the carbon has to be replaced and disposed of periodically and is  not intended to adsorb CFCs.</P>

<P>  Disposal is not the only option for handling used aerosol cans; at least one  company, Macon Iron and Metal in the Atlanta area, will accept aerosol  cans for recycling.  Customers are, however, required to sign an indemnity  agreement stating the aerosol cans are empty.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> As aerosol cans are under pressure, it is important to use the proper  personal protective equipment and to ensure that personnel are properly  trained.  Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health  and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing  any of  these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Reduces the difficulty of recycling or properly disposing of aerosol cans  not completely discharged during normal use.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> SAGE 2.1 software is a computer program designed to provide suggestions on alternative cleaning and degreasing technologies based on user-given responses. Solvents targeted for reduction under the US EPA 33/50 program, such as chlorinated solvents, are not included as valid alternatives in this program. Requested responses revolve around the users specific application, i.e., size, shape, and material of product to be cleaned; production needs; and present cleaning methods. A replacement cleaning process will require either an alternative solvent or a combination of alternative solvent and process.</P>

<P> SAGE narrows the list of alternative cleaning technologies to those technologies which best fit the application. The user can either 1) answer questions about the product and cleaning needs, allowing the program to suggest the best alternatives, or 2) go directly to the descriptions of alternative technologies. If the user only needs information about certain technologies, the information is available without having to go through the extensive question and answer process.</P>

<P>To learn which cleaning process is best suited for a particular application, the user should be prepared to answer questions about the product and production process. The program will supply generic responses to questions which the user cannot answer. Questions include the following:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Metallic or non-metallic?</P>

<P><li> Does the product have a coating? Should the coating be removed?</P>

<P><li> Does the part have blind holes or a complex shape?</P>

<P><li> Type of contaminant?</P>

<P><li> Is the part subject to cleanliness inspections?</P>

<P><li> What cleaning equipment is available?</P>

<P><li> Which chemicals are used for part cleaning?</P>

<P><li> Volume of parts to be cleaned?</P>

<P><li> Can part withstand ultrasonic vibration? High atmospheric pressure? High pressure spray?</P>
</ul>

<P>The program lists recommended technologies based on a scoring system which rates the technologies against the desired application. Brief summaries are available for each recommended technology. Information about chemical alternatives includes chemical properties, safety precautions, cleaning processes, and combustibility. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are included for all chemistries. In the descriptions about alternative processes, the user can learn about equipment costs, automation possibilities, safety precautions, compatible cleaning solutions, and particular applications.</P>

<P>Detailed reports describe each process and chemistry in greater detail, and can include a glossary of terms and a process conversion checklist. Pertinent subjects such as safety, economics, case studies, references, and vendor lists are all covered in the detailed reports.</P>

<P><B>Computer Requirements</B></P>

<P>To benefit from SAGE 2.1 you must have the following minimum computer system: </P>
<ul>
<P><li> PC-AT (286) or compatible computer with hard drive</P>

<P><li> EGA/VGA monitor</P>

<P><li> Five MB free space on hard drive</P>

<P><li> Copy of shareware program PKUNZIP.EXE.</P>
</ul>

<P>Copy the files SAGE.ZIP and PKUNZIP.EXE into the desired directory and type the command PKUNZIP SAGE. SAGE.ZIP will explode into 71 files. The file READ.ME, which can be read using a standard text editor, is a user&#146;s guide for the program, describing the background, installation, and operation of the program. The program can be activated by typing the command SAGE.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Chemical cleaning can sometimes be substituted for solvent cleaning to reduce the amount of toxic or hazardous chemicals used for the cleaning operation.</P>

<P> Solvent cleaning can be distinguished from chemical cleaning because a solvent&#146;s action is to dissolve the residue in or on the object to be cleaned, whereas a chemical cleaner acts by initiating a chemical reaction to remove the residue from the object. Chemical cleaners include products like bleach, which is an oxidizer. Other frequently used chemical cleaners are acids and bases. Acids are typically used to remove mineral deposits or scale from surfaces, while bases or alkaline solutions react with most carbonaceous residues; for example, oil and grease buildup. The acidity (or alkalinity) of the solutions is also depleted by the chemical action and any excess can easily be neutralized.</P>

<P> An important consideration is that chemical cleaners work only if properly selected. A careful evaluation of the residue for reactivity with a given chemical agent is critical to successful cleaning.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> This will depend on the material to be cleaned.  For example, highly alkaline (caustic) chemicals with a pH above 12 can etch aluminum, while acidic substances can cause hydrogen embrittlement in some steels.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p> Acids and bases can cause irritation to the skin and mucous membranes. The effects vary with the particular chemical being used. Proper personal protective equipment should always be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The benefits will vary according to the solvents you will be able to substitute the chemical cleaning process for.  In certain circumstances, chemical cleaning will allow you to use less toxic materials to get the same results as cleaning with a solvent.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>The principle disadvantage would be if the chemicals used were more dangerous to human life or the object being cleaned than the alternative solvent.  This must be looked at in a case by case basis.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The costs incurred will vary depending upon the material being cleaned and the contaminant(s) being removed. So the economics must be looked at on a case by case basis.  The principle costs that need to be considered are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> a comparison of disposal costs for the solvent versus disposal costs for the chemical chosen to replace the solvent; </P>

<P><li> any additional personal protective equipment (PPE) which might be necessary; and</P>

<P><li> any special handling or storage considerations for the solvent or chemical in question.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A key component of an integrated approach to pollution prevention is to minimize accidental and incidental releases of toxic and hazardous materials to the atmosphere. These releases usually result in not only a waste of material, but also in the generation of contaminated soil, absorbent material, and contaminated product that has to be treated and disposed. A structured plan is absolutely necessary to assure control of systems and to verify that the goal of zero spills can be achieved.</P>

<P> Spills are caused by a number of common factors, but the most likely causes are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Mechanical failure</P>

<P><li> Personnel error</P>

<P><li> Fires and explosions</P>

<P><li> Power failures, and</P>

<P><li> Natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes</P>
</ul>

<P>Since the great majority of spills result from the first two factors, which, to a large extent, also control the third factor, proper design and prevention measures can greatly reduce the incidence of spills. The following suggested measures go a long way toward laying the foundation for a system that will minimize occurrence of accidental spills:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Good design</P>

<P><li> Explicit and detailed operating and maintenance procedures</P>

<P><li> Thorough training of all personnel</P>

<P><li> Conscientious and timely maintenance of equipment and facilities</P>

<P><li> Strict job responsibility and accountability</P>

<P><li> Redundant process control and alarm monitoring systems</P>
</ul>

<P>Other proactive and reactive processes should be implemented to minimize the occurrence, reoccurrence, and severity of spills that do occur. This includes investigating all spills to determine root cause; performing process hazard analyses to look at factors such as chemical interactions, maximum material inventories, materials compatibility, and failure scenarios; and developing spill action plans to be followed in the event of a spill. In addition, physical barriers should be used to contain spills and minimize environmental damage (contamination of soil, groundwater, or leakage into sewers or surface waters) in the event of a release. Such physical barriers include neutralizing agents and containment devices (booms) strategically located to be quickly deployed in the event of a spill.</P>

<P><B>Monitoring Systems</B></P>

<P>Knowledge and decision making are critical to taking appropriate action when an unusual circumstance presents itself. Instrumentation is the key to obtaining fast and accurate knowledge of the status of the process. Furthermore, redundancy of instrumentation is a vital component of any good spill prevention system. All critical instruments, such as drum or tank level sensors, should be duplicated, preferably with an instrument using a different means of sensing to avoid a double failure.</P>

<P>Control and accuracy of inventory by material balance may also indicate a spill is occurring. Alarm setpoints should be chosen to minimize false alarms while maintaining adequate response for true failures.</P>

<P><B>Piping Systems</B></P>

<P>Pipelines are often the site of major spills, typically because of equipment failure. Guidelines for designing, maintaining, and operating pipelines are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> A standard identification system should be developed for all pipelines to assure proper and accurate indication of the product flowing within each and every line. All lines should be marked and their markings maintained.</P>

<P><li> Any product fill line entering a tank below the liquid level should have a check valve and isolation valve combination located close to the receiving tank in order to prevent massive backflow or siphoning of the material out of the tank. The isolation valve permits easy maintenance of the check valve as well as tight shutoff in the event of a transfer shutoff.</P>

<P><li> Underground pipelines should be avoided. If lines must be underground, they should have protective coatings and wrappings, as well as cathodic protection to minimize corrosion. In addition, a section of the underground line should be exposed and inspected annually until the entire length of the line has been inspected over a period of years. Then the process should be continued from the original starting point.</P>

<P><li> If a pipeline is taken out of service for an extended period of time, it should be marked, blind flanged, and isolated at both ends.</P>

<P><li> Pipelines supported just off the ground, especially those using wood or makeshift shoes, should be avoided. Pipelines should be routed in designated pipe racks with standard pipe shoes at each support point.</P>

<P><li> Stress analysis should be done for all piping subject to thermal cycling to avoid overstress and rupture during a cycle.</P>

<P><li> Designers should minimize the number of inaccessible valves and flanges. All connects should undergo at least a regular quarterly visual inspection, at which time an assessment can be made of the general condition of the line, its support structure, and other components.</P>

<P><li> Elevated pipe bridges should be used for road crossings and designed for the tallest regular vehicle traffic. Exceptional vehicular traffic should be notified of the crossing heights in order to allow time to make alternative arrangements.</P>

<P><li> Pumping systems should be located in close proximity to storage tanks.</P>

<P><li> Baffles, hard coatings, high alloys, long bends, or other means of abrasion resistant designs should be used for abrasive or erosive liquids.</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Bulk Storage</B></P>
<ul>
<P><li> Underground tank use should be avoided unless adequate measures have been taken to assure integrity of the vessel by a combination of careful design, quality construction, conscientious maintenance, continuous monitoring, and periodic inspection.</P>

<P><li> Material storage should only be done in vessels designed and constructed to meet the requirements of the stored material. Additionally, all vessels should be subjected to integrity testing by the most appropriate non-destructive means, e.g., x-ray, dye penetrant, etc. All tanks should also undergo hydrostatic testing as a new tank and following maintenance work.</P>

<P><li> Thickness testing should be done periodically and compared to the vessel&#146;s original thickness to track reduction due to corrosion.</P>

<P><li> Tank farms for large volume storage should have a spill containment volume (e.g., pits, dikes, or curbs) equal to 110% of the volume of the largest tank.</P>

<P><li> Drainage of rainwater from containment areas should be restricted to in-plant treatment, unless assurances such as locked valves, careful analysis of water, and monitoring of pumpouts are carried out.</P>

<P><li> Fail-safe engineering designs should be used on all tanks: high and low audible alarms with redundancy directed to a constantly manned control station and high level pump cut-offs or valve shutoffs to stop flow at a predetermined liquid level to prevent overfilling of tanks.</P>

<P><li> Visible product seeps or leaks from seams, cracks, or gaskets should be followed by immediate corrective action.</P>

<P><li> Analytic devices (e.g., pH sensors) should be installed in wastewater sumps or other collection point for early warning of spilled material.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>Compatibility of materials should always be checked before putting a pipeline, vessel, or piece of mechanical equipment into service. This includes not only the bulk materials of each item, but also the gaskets, o-rings, coatings, liners, and seals. Consider cleanout conditions, especially high temperature conditions, which may cause two materials compatible at a lower temperature to be incompatible at an elevated temperature.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Consult your local health and safety personnel for assistance in developing a spill prevention plan where needed.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<P>The benefits of spill prevention are:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Raw materials and finished products are not wasted, lost or disposed</P>

<P><li> Damage to the environment is minimized if product losses are minimized</P>

<P><li> Treatment and disposal costs are minimized and salable and useable product is maximized</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Spill prevention systems have definite costs; unfortunately, spill avoidance and the major costs and hazards that never manifest themselves are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify when trying to justify a spill prevention project on its economic merits. Sometimes historical cost data from past spills can be used in cost avoidance arguments.  In any event, the costs and benefits of spill prevention systems must be weighed for each individual case. </P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Generation of waste metal working fluids can be minimized by extending the useful life of the fluids. Metal working fluid life is a function of  various factors including:  type of metal working operation, type/quality of fluid used, housekeeping practices, contamination, bacterial contamination, and water quality.</P>

<P> Modular systems are available for on-site, batch recycle of metal working fluids. These systems clean the fluids by removing solids, bacteria, and tramp oil contaminants. These systems may incorporate filtration, centrifugation, pasteurization, oil skimming, and/or coalescence processing steps. Water or fluid concentrate may be added to the reclaimed fluid to adjust the fluid concentration to the desired level. The fluids are then returned to the machine sump(s).</P>

<P> Cincinnati Milacron markets modular systems for collection, treatment, and recycling of metal working fluids, one of which is in use at the Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The capital costs for a fluid collection device and recycle module would start at around $40,000.</P>

<P> An alternative to purchase, operation, and maintenance of recycling equipment by the shop is the use of mobile recycling services, such as Fluid Recycling Services. These services utilize similar processing steps to those described above to treat metal working fluids on-site on a periodic basis. There is typically a minimum charge per visit plus a rate per gallon of fluid treated.</P>

<P> For shops that generate less than 25 tons/yr. of waste cutting oil, or less than 45 tons/yr. of waste soluble oil machine coolant, a mobile fluid recycling service would probably be the preferred arrangement. For shops that generate larger amounts of waste metal working fluids, purchase of in-house recycling equipment should be considered. For either option, the economics of recycling metal working fluids are improved by minimizing the number of different metal working fluids used in one shop.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The pneumatically operated wet and dry vacuum will be able to recover spilled liquids, including fuels.  In this way, the use of rags, absorbents, and other spill collection items are minimized.</P>

<P> The vacuum operates pneumatically, connected to a compressor.  The vacuumed liquid can then be stored in 55-gallon drums or other suitable containers for recycling, reuse, or proper disposal.  In this way, absorbent materials for spill response is reduced or eliminated.  And since absorbent materials are normally heavy in weight, hazardous waste disposal costs can be reduced.</P>

<P> The pneumatic spill vacuum is in use at several DOD installations, including Hickam AFB.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The pneumatic spill vacuum is constructed to be compatible with a variety of fuels and solvents.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Caution should be exercised when responding to liquid spills.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should always be worn, and chemical incompatibility should be assessed.  In addition, flammability and the danger of explosions should be considered.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Minimize the use and cost of absorbents such as pillows, rags, and brooms</P>

<P><li> Actual contact with liquid spills are minimized</P>

<P><li> Decrease disposal costs associated with absorbents</P>

<P><li> Can be used on a variety of liquid spills, lessening the need for specific absorbents for specific chemicals</P>

<P><li> Improve spill response by speeding up collection of spills</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires energy source (compressor)</P>

<P><li> Requires proper disposal of spent activated carbon</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B>  Refrigerant R-502</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>N/A</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>  R-404a is an EPA Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP, Subpart G of 40 CFR Part 82) program approved substitute for R-502, which is a mixture of Class II (HCFCs) used primarily in large commercial and industrial refrigeration applications, such as cold storage warehouses, commercial ice machines, industrial process refrigeration units, and refrigerated transports.</P>

<P>R-404a is a near azeotropic mixture of the following refrigerants: HFC-125 (44%), HFC-143a (52%), and HFC-134a (4%).  These refrigerants are all hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and thus are not on either the Class I nor the Class II lists of ozone depleting substances (ODSs).  R-404a was developed as a long-term replacement for refrigeration equipment currently using primarily R-502.  R-404a provides similar energy efficiencies and capacities, but with a lower discharge temperature and slightly higher discharge pressure.  It is acceptable for both new equipment and retrofit equipment; however, triple flushing is sometimes necessary for retrofit equipment so that most (&gt;95% by weight) of the mineral oil lubricant is removed (allowable residual mineral oil is highly dependent on system configuration and operating conditions).  Flushing can usually be accomplished after removing and recovering the existing refrigerant by simply draining the existing mineral oil either from an oil drain plug or by removing the compressor and draining from the suction line.  In most small systems, 90-95% of the lubricant can be removed from the system in this manner.  Larger systems may require multiple drainage points, particularly if there are low spots around the evaporator.  In systems with an oil separator, any lubricant in the separator should also be drained.  In all cases, measure the volume of lubricant removed and compare to the compressor/system specifications to assure that &gt;95% of the lubricant has been removed.  If &gt;95% of the mineral oil lubricant has not been removed, flushing will be required (if the system shows poor heat transfer, the mineral oil residual is typically still too high).  Equipment using R-404a requires polyol ester lubricating oil, so flushing consists of selecting a polyol ester lubricant with a viscosity similar to the existing lubricant and charging an amount of polyol ester oil equal to the amount of mineral oil removed.  Recharge the system with the recovered R-502 in order to achieve thorough mixing of the two lubricants (48 to 72 hours of operation may be required).  Repeat this procedure twice more, but on the last charge of fresh polyol ester oil, recharge the system with R-404a instead of the recovered R-502.  Note - special care should be taken when handling polyol ester lubricants due to their tendency to absorb water; minimize contact with air and keep in a sealed container.</P>

<P>The following precautions regarding R-404a use should also be noted:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Because R-404a is a blend, any leaks in a system may allow components of the blend to bleed off at different rates, leaving behind an altered blend that may mask system problems during troubleshooting and failures.  Leak detection and prevention  should be maintenance priorities, especially when running systems with refrigerant mixtures.</P>

<P><li> Service ports and valves on retrofit systems should be well marked and identified to assure the refrigerant type is known by all service and maintenance personnel.</P>

<P><li> The chemical compatibility of plastics and elastomers should be considered before retrofitting.  Gaskets, shaft seals, and o-ring materials should be reviewed with the equipment manufacturer before retrofitting.</P>

<P><li> Use of HFCs is subject to the no-venting prohibition under the Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 608 (c) (2), which takes effect November 15, 1995, at the latest.</P>
</ol>

<P> For most retrofit systems, the optimum charge of R-404a will be 85-90% of the weight of the equipment manufacturers recommended R-502 charge.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> In order to detect leaks in pressure vessels, refrigeration systems, and various other equipment, the equipment can either be pressurized or evacuated and tested for leaks.  Instruments sensitive to certain types of  gas are then used to pinpoint leaks in the vessel or system  The repair of small leaks leads to greater safety and lower product losses, which result in lower costs.  Past practice has often been to pressurize a piece of equipment with a refrigerant, such as CFC-12, and then use one of a wide range of refrigerant leak detectors to snoop for leaks. However, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are significant contributors to ozone depletion, and are therefore being phased out of production.  Alternatives to CFCs for leak detection are available for testing the integrity of high-pressure equipment and systems.</P>

<P> Several options are available to replace CFC-12 as a leak-detection agent. Options include, a refrigerant and nitrogen/air mixture, a refrigerant alone, or simply an inert gas.  Some standard leak detection equipment can detect all leak-detection agent alternatives.  Leak detectors primarily designed to qualitatively indicate the presence or absence of leak-detection agents are used to pin point leaks.  Equipment is available that will detect specific concentrations; however, this equipment is very expensive and is not necessary for locating system leaks.  Replacement compounds are described briefly below.  Detection equipment and special leak detection systems for refrigeration units are described in detail in the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheet, &#147;Leak Detection and Emission Reduction of Refrigerants from Refrigeration Systems.&#148;</P>

<P><B>Replacement Compounds</B></P>

<P>Refrigerant Tracer: In order to use testing equipment presently available, a refrigerant and air, or a refrigerant and nitrogen mixture is cycled through a system to check for leaks. The reason for having refrigerant present in the leak-detection agent is that it&#146;s the presence of refrigerant makes a leak readily detected.</P>

<P>Inert Gases: Use of inert gases for leak detection can be similar to using a refrigerant-based tracer. Inert gases like helium or argon can be used, although special detectors are required. Nitrogen or compressed air can also be used.</P>

<P><B>Others Methods</B></P>

<P>(Soap) Bubble Test: A simple leak test can be performed by applying a soap solution to potential leak sources and observing for bubbles</P>

<P>Dye: Dyes can be applied to suspect areas or mixed into other materials in order to better locating leaking areas. </P>

<P>Electronic Leak Detectors: Electronic leak detectors can identify the presence of specific refrigerants or gases, and can give a reading on the relative size of the leak. These detectors have movable probes that are effective in areas where a soap bubble test would be difficult.</P>

<P>Hydrostatic testing: Hydrostatic testing uses compressed water as the leak detection agent.  This method has limited applicability for leak detection in refrigeration systems and is used primarily for pressure vessels and piping systems.</P>

<P>Manometer: Manometers can be used to measure minute changes in pressure across evaporators or condenser coils. While a manometer cannot determine exact locations of leaks, it can identify the section of equipment where refrigerant is being lost.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Most refrigerants are very inert and have relatively low toxicity.  However, some are rather toxic, and others can degrade into toxic materials if they decompose; for example, by exposure to a flame.  Therefore, leak testing should never present gas concentrations above the compound&#146;s permissible exposure limits unless proper personal protective equipment is used.  In addition, chemical compatibility with leak detection equipment should always be checked with the original equipment manufacturer to safeguard components such as gaskets, o-rings, and valve packing.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Cylinders which contain nitrogen or compressed air are pressurized to extremely high levels (2,500 to 3,000 psig). Handle all high-pressure gas cylinders with extreme care! Secure all gas cylinders prior to use by chaining or tying to a column or other rigid support.</P>

<P>Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any leak detection method or product.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The principle benefit is the ability to use an alternative to CFC-12.  There are also secondary benefits, such as the rapid determination and repair of leaks before equipment is put into service can greatly reduce the amount of refrigerant or product lost. This should result in not only reduced environmental effects, but also cost savings from reduced losses and fewer service outages.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>The only disadvantage would be the extra time it takes to adapt the current processes over to a new testing procedure.  However, this is to be expected in any process improvement change.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Clean-In-Place (CIP) is a method designed to &#147;automatically&#148; clean pipes and process equipment without the time and labor requirement of manually dismantling equipment components.  Long-term, CIP is less expensive and more consistent than conventional manual cleaning methods.  CIP is not a substitute for toxic solvents, but rather, a more efficient way to use them.</P>

<P> CIP is more of a design method than a cleaning process.  The CIP method works &#147;automatically&#148; by eliminating the places where residue can accumulate.  This is achieved by placing pipes at an angle to the horizontal (minimum 3%) to improve drainage and by using instruments and valves that connect flush to pipes, eliminating &#147;dead legs&#148; (places where residues can be trapped). CIP is perhaps best applied to batch process operations because the amount of residual product from a batch can contaminate subsequent batches and given the frequency of these operations, the CIP method is ideally suited to fast turnarounds and to achieving a high degree of piping and equipment cleanliness.</P>

<P> The CIP method can be improved with specially designed process equipment, piping, and fittings which have ducts and spray balls for cleaning the equipment internally.  As of July 1994, only diaphragm valves have been used with CIP; ball and slide valves can be modified with injection ports for use with CIP, but this makes them very complex.</P>

<P> To enhance the CIP method, use a CIP cleaning system which consists of a centralized control unit with satellite spray-washing and rinsing units to clean the process equipment, pumps, valves, and pipes.  Also, use gear pumps with a low &#147;dead&#148; volume (where &#147;dead&#148; volume refers to the amount of void space that does not drain freely and as a consequence can be difficult to clean because material is stagnant and then dries or polymerizes).  Mechanical drives have internal parts which have void spaces where residue can be deposited; these must be removed for cleaning, so for difficult applications with rotating equipment such as agitators, magnetic drives should be used.</P>

<P> The CIP cleaning system is procured as a package consisting of a recirculation system: storage tank, pump, heat exchanger, and rotary strainer; a chemical feeder which makes the cleaning solutions; a cleaning system with spray balls and piping to supply and return the various solutions; solution-return tanks; and control instrumentation.  After the chemical process is complete, activate the CIP cleaning system to clean and rinse the equipment, the cleaning can even be integrated into the process program.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> As the CIP cleaning system does not alter the actual chemicals used for cleaning, material compatibility should not be an issue.   </P>

<h3>Safety and Health:</h3> 

<p>Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>For most process plants, the use of CIP systems increases overall capital costs by about 10%.  However, the return on investment due to lower labor, raw material, and energy costs can mean pay  back in less than a year.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Semi-synthetic and synthetic coolants typically have longer useful lives, and thus require fewer changeouts, than conventional oil-based cutting fluids.  Semi-synthetic and synthetic coolants are also more resistant to problems such as rapid bacterial growth, which is often the reason coolants are disposed of prematurely. At a typical shop, the personnel change cooling fluid when it emits a rancid odor. The odor is caused by anaerobic bacterial growth and does not indicate that the cutting fluid has lost its cooling and lubricating properties. However, the presence of microorganisms over a period of time can cause coolants to degrade. The resulting adverse condition of the coolant include foul odors, clogged transfer lines, changes in pH, and splitting emulsions. These conditions can affect the quality of the final product.</P>

<P> The coolant is typically removed from the cutting machine's sumps when the odor of the bacterial growth overpowers shop personnel. On average, the coolant is removed from the cutting machines every 3 weeks. The time between fluid change is usually 2 to 3 weeks in the summer months, while it is extended to 3 to 4 weeks during the winter. This is due to the variance of temperature and moisture, both of which affect the rate of bacterial growth. </P>

<P> Several DOD facilities have switched to a semi-synthetic coolant with considerable success. Personnel at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New Hampshire, code 120, have tested semi-synthetic coolants, among others Castrol TLS-995. This effort was conducted as part of a NAVSEA machine shop modernization program to determine cutting fluid pollution prevention alternatives among eight naval shipyards. The results showed that the semi-synthetic coolant had been in use for over 6 months without changeout or experiencing the bacterial growth problems encountered at other facilities which use oil-based coolants. By switching to a semi-synthetic coolant that would last 6 months, an activity can reduce the amount of coolant waste by almost 90%, as evidenced at NADEP Norfolk.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> There are mild dermal and eye irritation effects associated with these compounds. Personal protective equipment should be used. Consult your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDSs prior to using these materials.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Using a semi-synthetic or synthetic coolant can: </P>
<ul>
<P> <li> Reduce coolant waste by as much as 90% </P>

<P>   <li> Lower disposal costs</P>

<P>   <li> Reduce coolant replacement costs</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Immersion is an effective method of parts washing.  It is the simplest and least aggressive cleaning method.  It can use non-toxic or non-ODS chemicals.  Immersion is useful when dirt is easily removed and low equipment cost is important; however, it is generally slower than other methods of washing and is only viable for smaller components.</P>

<P> Immersion cleaning can be accomplished in several ways, by using different processes exclusively or together.  The processes are heat, agitation, enzymes, detergents, or ultrasonic agitation.</P>
<ol>
<P><li>  Heat (aqueous solutions only) - the effectiveness of aqueous solvents increases with temperature; however, there is an optimum temperature for each situation governed by the physical characteristics of the materials involved.</P>

<P><li>  Agitation - achieved by constant movement of the cleaning solvent through and around the part being cleaned; this provides faster cleaning than simple soaking.</P>

<P><li>  Surfactants (detergents) - useful because they break down dirt and aid in the solvent process; this is faster than simple soaking.</P>

<P><li> Enzymes - added to the washing materials, such as soaps and detergents. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze specific reactions that break down dirt, oils, and greases, enhancing cleaning.  Enzyme washing requires time for the enzymes to soak in and act.</P>

<P><li>  Ultrasonic agitation - a method of agitating the part being cleaned through high frequency sound.  This action literally shakes the dirt off.</P>
</ol>

<H3>Material Compatibility:</H3>

<p>Most materials have specifications which they must be cleaned by.  For example, some materials can not be exposed to heat or vibration.  In addition certain steels are prone to flash rusting and certain preventative measures must be taken.  Check with the appropriate cognizant authority prior to using a new cleaning  technique.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</h3>

<p>Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The principle benefit of using immersion soaking is the simplicity of the process which should lead to lower capital costs and safer chemicals being used.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>Immersion soaking may take more time or repeated applications to return the same results as you are currently receiving.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> This will vary case to case, but typically immersion soaking is a less capital intensive method of cleaning, so lower costs can be expected.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy: Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<p> </p>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Solvent distillation as a means of recycling, is a viable alternative to the single use/disposal of solvents.  It is environmentally benign and reduces the amount of solvent purchased and disposed.  Solvent distillation is best suited for processing waste solvents with excessive contamination.</P>

<P> Solvent distillation units process waste solvents in separate, stand-alone batch, on-line batch, or continuous systems.  The distillation units heat the waste solvent to its boiling point.  This causes the solvent to evaporate and the solvent vapors are then condensed in a separate container.  The remaining contaminants in the process chamber are disposed.  The basic components of a distillation unit are the process chamber or boiler, encapsulated heaters, a water-cooled chamber, and associated piping and instrumentation.  Temperature sensors monitor the temperature and help maintain the required distillation temperature.  Disposable vessel liners can be used to provide simple collection and disposal of still bottoms.  Vacuum pumps that can distill high-boiling solvents at lower temperatures are also available.</P>

<P> Operating experience at Charleston AFB has shown recoveries of 90 to 95 percent for solvents recycled by batch vacuum distillation. Five-gallon batches of methyl ethyl ketone or paint thinner in nominal 5-gallon units typically require 3.5- to 3.75-hour cycles to complete evaporation.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Distillation equipment should be constructed of high-alloy stainless steel to prevent corrosion from degradation of solvents or the heating oil.  The alloys also protect against iron contamination of the recovered solvent.  Using a liner adds an extra layer of protection to the distillation unit&#146;s boiling chamber and greatly simplifies cleaning.  The liner containing the solvent residue is simply lifted out of the unit for proper disposal.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</h3>

<p>Proper design, operation, and maintenance of the distillation equipment are required for its safe use.</P>

<P> Inhalation of solvent vapors can cause irritation to the respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure may result in damage to the lungs and central nervous system.  Contact with the skin can cause dryness, irritation, and possibly dermatitis.  Use in well ventilated areas with proper personal protective equipment.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Less hazardous waste and hazardous air emissions are generated</P>

<P><li> Reduces hazardous waste disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Provides solvent cost savings</P>

<P><li> Reduces worker exposure to solvent, hazardous waste, and hazardous air emissions</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires trained personnel to perform the recycling process and operate the process equipment</P>

<P><li> Equipment or recycling process may require permits from a local regulatory agency</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Solvent distillation systems need to be specific to the type of solvent, the contaminants being removed, the batch size or throughput, and the type of cleaning operation.  This leads to a wide range of costs.</P>

<P> For instance, self-contained, batch-distillation  units vary in price from $2,000 to more than $30,000.  Costs of the units depend on the size, the materials of construction, and the options selected.  Capacities typically range from 1- to 250-gallon batches.  The following cost estimate is for the use of a 2-gallon capacity solvent distillation recycling unit.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Freon 113 usage (single use of solvent application):   500 gal/yr</P>

<P><li> Freon 113 usage (with distillation unit):  100 gal/yr</P>

<P><li> Freon procurement cost:  $70.85/gal</P>

<P><li> Waste solvent (single use of solvent application): 400 gal or 640 lb/yr</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Steam cleaning is a viable solvent alternative for removing oily or greasy residue.  Heat is primarily used in the steam cleaning process.  Heat accelerates emulsification, break-down, and removal of caked-on dirt and grease.  Steam&#146;s high temperature and low specific heat allow surfaces to be heated to relatively high temperatures.  High temperature is maintained on the surface long enough for the steam to vaporize or liquefy the oil, grease, or dirt.  The residue can then be effectively washed away with the condensate remaining from the condensed steam.  Steam cleaning can also be used with a degreasing agent (often a surfactant) that enhances the solubility of grease in water.</P>

<P> Steam cleaners are available to perform medium duty (e.g. auto parts, engines, etc.) to heavy duty (e.g. large machinery and oil drilling rigs) cleaning jobs.  Steam cleaning units can be electric or fired with gasoline or diesel fuel. </P>

<P> The wastewater generated from the steam cleaning process may be treated at an industrial wastewater treatment plant, depending on the toxicity of the dirt and grease removed.  Analysis of the wastewater is required prior to disposal.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Flash rusting may be a problem for certain types of steel.  Preventative measures may have to be taken.  Prior to implementing this technology, performing a test case is recommended to ensure that the desired finish product is achieved.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the amount of hazardous waste and hazardous air emissions generated compared to solvent degreasing</P>

<P><li> Wastewater stream is generally compatible with conventional industrial wastewater plants located at many installations</P>

<P><li> Low implementation cost utilizing simple equipment</P>

<P><li> Provides solvent cost savings</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Steam cleaning is not recommended for any equipment, component, or material that is temperature or moisture sensitive</P>

<P><li> Water can penetrate and/or damage joints, seals, and bonded areas</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The capital cost for medium and heavy duty steam cleaning units will vary considerably, depending upon the unit type and its application.  Capital costs for these systems can range from $5,000 to $12,000.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Lubricant analysis programs are testing programs are used to determine whether a lubricant remains effective.  A lubricant analysis program may allow longer intervals between changing lubricants thereby reducing lubricant consumption and waste disposal.  In this program, samples of lubricant are collected and either analyzed in the field (using test equipment) or sent to an analytical laboratory for analysis.  Representative sample collection is critical to ensure that the sample being analyzed is indicative of the lubricant's overall condition.  Four main types of lubricant testing procedures are discussed in this data sheet.</P>

<P> <B>Physical/Chemical Analysis</B></P>

<P> The parameters that are typically evaluated include viscosity, total base number (a measure of the oil's ability to neutralize acids), and the concentration of some metal ions (e.g., calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, and zinc) which are components of many additives.  Once the samples are analyzed, various factors depending on the history of the equipment must be considered in determining when the oil requires changing.  For example, metal levels in engine oils can vary depending on numerous factors including:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Engine metallurgy</P>

<P><li> Oil/lubricant consumption and replacement</P>

<P><li> Types of engine lubricants and additives</P>

<P><li> Filtration efficiency</P>

<P><li> Dispersion characteristics of the oil&#146;s additive package (which help hold metals in suspension)</P>
</ul>

<P> These and other factors must be considered when evaluating whether an oil is good for continued use.  Rapid changes in contaminant metal concentrations or rapid fluctuation of other oil properties are much more important in determining whether an oil is failing rather than a strict adherence to published ranges of criteria.  Rapid changes in oil properties can be indicative of faulty equipment, severe operating conditions, or insufficient maintenance procedures.  </P>

<P> Determining whether an additive package is depleted is difficult, because additive packages vary from one manufacturer to another, and most analytical tools available do not directly measure the concentration of the additive package.  This is primarily a difficulty when oils from different manufactures are mixed together.  Using a single brand of oil will minimize this difficulty.  </P>


<P> <B>Ferrographic Analysis</B></P>

<P> Ferrographic analysis is a predictive method for determining equipment condition long before signs of wear are detected.  Ferrography detects large and small particles of ferrous, non-ferrous, and nonmetallic materials that are generated at the contact surfaces of moving parts.  These particles are analyzed, and changes from previous results indicate a developing mechanical problem.  If sufficient information about the equipment's metallurgy is available, it may be possible to identify which gear, bearing, etc., is wearing.  The size, number composition, and type of particles indicate the severity of the wear.</P>

<P> <B>Dielectric Constant</B></P>

<P> A third form of analysis is a field test unit that measures the dielectric constant of a lubricating oil which is indicative of oxidation of the lubricant molecules.  Dielectric constant is monitored as a function of time, and once the deterioration exceeds recommended limits, the oil should be changed.  The test equipment can indicate if one of three following potential problems are present: 1) moderate dielectric increase indicative of contamination due to fuel soot, sludge, dirt, oxidation, or acid build-up (this condition is monitored over time until a predetermined point is reached at which time the oil should be changed); 2) severe dielectric increase indicative of water, antifreeze, or metal particles (immediate action is called for to avoid potentially serious equipment damage); and 3) moderate dielectric decrease due to gasoline or diesel fuel dilution (this condition is also indicative of a potentially serious problem that needs immediate attention).  Note that moderate dielectric decreases are sometimes difficult to detect.</P>

<P> <B>Particle Counters</B></P>

<P> A fourth form of analysis is the particle counter, which measures the number and size of particles present in oils and hydraulic fluids.  Use of an electronic particle counter offers a viable alternative to the patch test, which has traditionally been conducted with CFC-113 or methyl chloroform (both class 1, ozone depleting substances).  This equipment requires no hazardous solvents, and test results are accurate and non-subjective.  Use of this technology is approved for Navy activities as specified in the NA 01-1A-17 Aviation Hydraulics Manual.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Waste oil must be handled with care.  The main concern is skin absorption.  Proper personal protective equipment is, therefore, recommended.  Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the frequency of oil changes</P>

<P><li> Decreases consumption and purchase of virgin oil</P>

<P><li> Reduces the generation of waste oil </P>

<P><li> Provides valuable diagnostic information</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Higher level of knowledge is required to perform the diagnostic tests or take representative samples</P>

<P><li> Data must be collected over time and analyzed to determine trends</P>

<P><li> Results are subject to interpretation</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The capital and operation costs will vary with each of the analytical techniques available for a lubricant analysis program and also with the equipment that is included in the program.  The cost analysis will be for a lubricant analysis program using a dielectric constant monitoring program which has a relatively low capital cost.  Higher capital cost equipment, such as particle counters, will result in a longer payback period.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Dielectric constant sensor cost: $700</P>

<P><li> Program involves monitoring 125 vehicles with average 6.5 quarts oil each</P>

<P><li> Regular oil changes conducted at six month intervals</P>

<P><li> Analysis program increases oil change interval to eight months</P>

<P><li> Labor: 45 minutes per oil change, 15 minutes per test</P>

<P><li> Average of three tests conducted per vehicle per year</P>

<P><li> Labor rate: $30/hr</P>

<P><li> New oil purchase cost: $3.50/gal</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: High; Air Force: High</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B>  Halon 1211</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>Halon 1211 (CAS: 353-59-3)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Halon 1211 is a widely used fire suppression and explosion protection agent applied as a streaming agent and, for example, has been the fire extinguishing agent of choice for portable fire extinguishers in C-130 aircraft.  However, it also has one of the higher ozone depletion potentials (or ozone layer depleting effects) of any compound, and thus its production and use are being curtailed and eventually eliminated.  Nevertheless, Halon 1211 is still approved for use, but only in mission-critical applications.  In addition, each application requires a waiver for procurement of replacement Halon 1211, and its procurement must come from the DLA Halon reserve, since its production has already been phased out.  Furthermore, any existing non-mission-critical applications must be decommissioned and allocated to the Halon reserve&#146;s stockpile.</P>

<P> There are several Halon 1211 substitutes approved by the EPA&#146;s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program; though none is an ideal replacement, they are acceptable subject to specific use conditions as cited in 40 CFR 82 Appendix A to Subpart G, &#147;Substitutes Subject to Use Restrictions and Unacceptable Substitutes.&#148;  The following substitutes are listed:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> HBFC-22B1 (an interim substitute at best, since its high ozone depletion potential qualifies it for phased out production by January 1, 1996), Surfactant Blend A, HCFC Blend B, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), or perfluorohexane, (C<SUB>6</SUB>F<SUB>14</SUB>), although perfluorohexane is not regarded as an acceptable alternative for use by any of the branches of the DOD.</P>
</ul>

<P> Note: Since the SNAP approved alternatives for Halon 1211 have narrow use limits, extreme care must be taken when converting, retrofitting, or redesigning Halon 1211 systems.  </P>

<P> Halon 1211 is a brominated, chlorinated fluorocarbon used primarily for fire suppression and explosion prevention.  Because it is a severe ozone depleting substance, there is a serious effort to eliminate its use by developing and finding qualified substitutes.  The EPA has developed a list of acceptable alternatives as an initiative of the SNAP program.  Presently, there are several approved alternatives to Halon 1211.  Nevertheless, it is critical that any alternative&#146;s applicability be verified, given the long list of qualifications and use conditions to which each alternative is subject.  The variation in use conditions is mainly a result of physical property differences.  A substitute compound may not be as effective in extinguishing a fire, and so a higher concentration of the extinguishing agent is required.  High gas concentrations also increase the sensitivity of personnel to cardiotoxicity and reduce available oxygen content; as a result, many of the use conditions require personnel evacuation in 30 seconds or less, a critical and sometimes impossible requirement to meet.</P>

<P> Each and every alternative for any application should be carefully reviewed for applicability to the use conditions.  For example, an aqueous foam can not be used for explosion protection.  For the halocarbon alternatives, oxygen displacement and cardiotoxicity are the primary concerns.</P>

<P> The main factors to weigh when considering conversion to a Halon 1211 alternative are the following:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Are there non-halocarbon alternatives that would work for the application, such as dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or foam systems?  If not, what are the halocarbon alternatives?</P>

<P><li> Is the candidate substitute EPA SNAP approved?</P>

<P><li> Has the candidate substitute been tested by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM)?</P>

<P><li> Does the candidate substitute conform with the National Fire Protection Association Standard for Clean Agent Extinguishing Systems (NFPA Standard 2001)?</P>

<P><li> Does the candidate substitute have zero ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential?  If not, it may also be targeted for replacement sometime in the future; for example, any HCFC substitute will eventually be phased out over the next 20 years per the Montreal protocol on ozone depleting substances.</P>

<P><li> Is the existing equipment compatible with the candidate substitute?  If not what are the performance compromises, costs, and retrofit requirements?</P>
</ol>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>


<p>Switching from Halon 1211 to an approved alternative will reduce the amount of ozone depletion chemical going into the environment.  The switch may also provide a non-global warming agent or one with a lower global warming potential.  Careful consideration of the choices is necessary in order to select the optimal alternative.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Use of pollution prevention funds for replacement of Halon fire extinguishing systems with non-Halon based systems is not authorized if the reason for conversion is that the existing system has reached the end of its life expectancy.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Ultrasonic cleaning is a process enhancement to immersion cleaning to improve the cleaning efficiency of most liquids, including neutral, alkaline, acidic aqueous solutions, and semiaqueous solutions.  It is a viable alternative to traditional solvent-based cleaning operations such as vapor degreasing.  Ultrasonics can be used to clean from gross to precision levels and effectively removes particles, machining chips, grease, oils, and other contaminants.</P>

<P>An ultrasonic cleaning system consists of transducers, a generator, a tank, and a liquid medium.  The transducers convert the energy supplied by the generator to sonic energy vibrations.  These vibrations are transmitted through the tank and produce cavitation bubbles in the liquid medium in the tank.  The formation and collapse of these bubbles create a scrubbing action that is very effective at removing contaminants.  The energy provided by the ultrasonics will raise the temperature of the liquid;  heaters, thermostats, and cooling coils may be required to control the operating temperature to within a few degrees.</P>

<P>Ultrasonic cleaning is usually employed in a multistage process consisting of an ultrasonic wash, rinse, and dry.  Depending on the application, the cleaning process may include a prewash to remove gross contaminants and a spray rinse to reduce dragout into the rinse tank.  Ultrasonics may be used in the rinse step as well.  The drying step may incorporate some combination of air knives, hot-air ovens, and vacuum drying ovens.</P>

<P>Ultrasonics can be used to improve the cleaning efficiency of an immersion cleaning process.  Special safety equipment must be used if the cleaning solution is flammable or combustible.  Additives such as surfactants should be low foaming.</P>

<P>Proper fixturing is important to assure uniform cleaning.  Improperly designed fixtures may create &#147;shadows&#148; which block the action of ultrasonic waves.  Baskets should have a wide mesh with minimal part contact, and parts should be placed to avoid nesting.  Delicate parts should be fixed in place to keep them from moving during insertion into and removal from the tank.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Ultrasonics work best on sound-reflecting materials such as metal, glass, and plastics.  It is less efficient on sound-absorbing materials such as rubber and cloth.  Excessive dwell times may cause cavitation erosion of some materials.  Resonant damage caused by standing ultrasonic waves can be reduced by using a sweep frequency.  </P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p> Ultrasonics typically operate in the 25 kHz to 40 kHz range;  hearing protection may be required.  Other safety and health issues depend on the cleaning solution used. Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 <ul>
<P><li> ultrasonics can achieve very high levels of cleanliness</P>

<P><li> they are capable of removing small particles (smaller than 0.000005 meters)</P>

<P><li> can remove debris from parts with complex geometries.</P>

<P><li> for the same cleaning solution, ultrasonics can achieve a given level of cleanliness faster than immersion dipping, using the same cleaning solution</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> unlike vapor degreasing and other methods using highly volatile solvents, ultrasonic cleaning may require rinsing and drying of parts</P>

<P><li> ultrasonics are generally not as effective as directed sprays for cleaning blind holes</P>

<P><li> the waste stream should be tested for dissolved metals or other hazardous constituents</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Will vary on a case by case basis.  Factors affecting capital investment and operating costs are size of system, number of tanks, cleanliness level, production rate, and operating temperature.</P>

<P>Standard sizes are available and may range from 5-gallon capacity benchtop units with 240 watts output power to 35-gallon capacity units with 1440 watts output power.  Manufacturers can also provide custom configurations designed to meet specific needs.  </P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> JP-5 aviation fuel, contaminated with particulates and water, is currently used as lower grade fuel.  The use of an aviation fuel recycler to recover JP-5 would eliminate or reduce the amount of contaminated fuel waste for disposal and/or reuse.  To implement such a system, it will be necessary to segregate the collection of contaminated JP-5.</P>

<P> A simple JP-5 aviation fuel recycling system typically consists of a filter separator, coalescer separator, a working tank, a clean fuel tank, and auxiliary pumps.  The filter separator removes particulate contaminants from the fuel.  The coalescer separator removes water from the fuel.  These units have replaceable filter cartridges or elements.  Some systems come with multiple units of the filter separator and the coalescer separator.  A simple system without the working and clean fuel tanks comes skid mounted on a 5&#146; x 5&#146; skid.  Other systems with multiple units and including the working tank and the clean fuel tank comes on two skids, typically 8.5&#146; x 14&#146;.  The smallest units can process from 15 to 50 gpm of contaminated JP-5 fuel.  The larger units which are used at bulk terminals associated with refining facilities can process from 1200 gpm and up.</P>

<P> After treatment in the recycler, the cleaned JP-5 fuel needs to be laboratory tested and certified to ensure that it meets MIL-T-5624 for JP-5 fuel prior to use in any aircraft.  The particulate and water separated from the JP-5 aviation fuel is disposed as a hazardous waste.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces high-grade fuel waste and associated disposal costs</P>

<P><li> Promotes waste minimization through reuse of fuel product</P>

<P><li> Reduces purchases of JP-5 aviation fuel</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<P><li> None</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The following economic analysis compares the use of a JP-5 aviation fuel recycler and disposal of contaminated JP-aviation fuel through a commercial recycling facility.  The JP-5 aviation fuel recycling system will consist of three fuel/water separators (filter-dehydrator, coalescer separator, and a fuel/water separator), two micronic particulate filters, a process tank, an issue tank, a process pump, an issue pump, and auxiliary instrumentation.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Super Flight Line Electrical Distribution System (SFLEDS) can be used in place of diesel fired mobile electric power plants (MEPP) and eliminate exhaust emissions.  Electric support equipment can also be used instead of diesel-fired equipment.  SFLEDS uses the host facility&#146;s power and redistributes the conditioned power along the flight line.  SFLEDS converts and conditions 480V, 60Hz host facility grid power to 120V, 60Hz output for low-voltage equipment; 115V, 400 Hz output for aircraft; and an output of 480V, 60Hz for heavy-duty equipment.  Implementation of this system requires routing of 480 volts, 60 hertz power cable from the host facility grid to the SFLEDS site.  SFLEDS configuration includes frequency converters, transformers, and electrical controls.</P>

<P> The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey is currently in the process of designing a SFLEDS prototype for installation at Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego, California.  Final design for this prototype is expected to be completed by September 1996.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper design, operation, and maintenance of the equipment is required for its safe use.  Installation of electrical systems must be performed only by trained personnel.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, and your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>

<P><li> Eliminates hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions</P>

<P><li> Reduces handling and use of hazardous and flammable materials on the flight line</P>
</ul>

<P><B>Revision:</B> 8/96</P>

<P><B>Process Code: </B>Navy: SR-04-02; Air Force: FA03; Army: ELM</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: Medium</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Detroit Diesel Engine Model 6V-71</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide (CAS: 630-08-0), and other diesel combustion byproducts</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The use of low emission diesel engines as a power supply for mobile air conditioners will reduce emissions at activities in addition to meeting 1996 federal and state standards for emissions from off-road industrial diesel engines.  State standards vary from state to state.  However, meeting the most stringent standards of California will result in meeting other states&#146; emission standards.  Existing mobile air conditioners will require retrofitting as they are all currently powered by a Detroit Diesel Model 6V-71.</P>

<P> A study conducted for the Navy evaluated several engines on the basis of meeting emission standards, performance specifications for the air conditioner, use of jet fuel, and the ability to fit the present engine space envelope.  The John Deere 6081A engine met all requirements.  Two other engines manufactured by Cummins and Caterpillar could be considered with some modifications in engine design.</P>

<P> The mobile air conditioners will require some modifications to accept the new engines.  The radiator and oil cooler of the air conditioner will need to be extended slightly outward.  Because these engines are longer than the 6V-71 engine, relocation of the engine mounts and a suitable connecting structure to distribute the load within the base frame will also be required.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist and your local health and safety personnel prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Reduction in engine exhaust emissions</P>

<P><li> Compliance with federal and state emission standards</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>
<p><li> None</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P>Labor, material, system maintenance, and energy requirements will remain the same with the new low emission diesel power supply engine for the mobile air conditioner because the new engine is required to provide the same performance (horsepower and torque range) as the existing Detroit diesel engine.  </P>

<P> The mobile air conditioner is considered as a stationary source of air emissions.  With the engine retrofit, there is a reduction in air emissions and therefore a reduction in emission fees if there is a significant number of these units at an activity.  On a per unit basis, the reduction in emission fees is insignificant.  The cost savings in emission fees when compared to the cost of the retrofit engine at approximately $40,000 will not result in a favorable payback period.</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: High; Army: Medium; Air Force: High</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Chlorinated Solvent Hand Wipe Cleaning, Aerosol Sprays</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CAS: 71-55-6), CFC-113 (CAS: 76-13-1), Methyl ethyl ketone (CAS: 78-93-3), Toluene (CAS: 108-88-3)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Wet Task Wiping System from Kimberly-Clark Corporation has been used under the Navy&#146;s P2 Afloat Program to replace many uses of aerosol cans and rag use.  This system consists of a 1.2-gallon bucket with a perforated top through which pre-moistened wipes are removed.  The wipes and cleaning solutions are added to the 1.2-gallon bucket by the user allowing the user to select the appropriate solvent.  The wipes are roughly 12 inches by 12 inches, one-ply paper towelettes, with 60 wipes per roll.  The wipes are available in two varieties for solvents of regular strength and solvents with strong solvation action.  The regular solvent strength wipes are designed for detergents and solvents such as alcohols.  The extra solvent strength wipes are designed for organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone.</P>

<P> Hand wipe cleaning can reduce the use of aerosol cans and ozone depleting compounds.  The Wet Task Wiping System is designed so the cleaning solution of choice can be added to the container of wipes.  This allows the user to select the solvent which is most appropriate for the task.  In addition, this system allows the user to select more environmental-friendly cleaning solutions such as aqueous cleaning solutions or low vapor pressure cleaning solutions.  As each hand wipe is pulled from the container, it is compressed through the opening to remove excess solution from the wipe. This packaged hand wipe system will also replace the use of rags and reduce waste disposal since the wipes have less mass than rags.  In addition, the hand wipe system eliminates the disposal of aerosol cans.  </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The buckets are designed to be compatible with all types of common solvents and cleaning solutions.  The wipes are available in two varieties: (1) solvents of regular strength and (2) solvents with strong solvation action.  The regular solvent strength wipes are designed for detergents and solvents such as alcohols.  The extra solvent strength wipes are designed for organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Aqueous cleaning solutions may be acidic or alkaline.  Organic solvents are flammable.  Cleaning solutions or solvents may have an irritating effect on skin or mucus membranes.  Some components of cleaning solutions or solvents may have toxic components.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces disposal of aerosol cans and rags</P>

<P><li> Reduces solvent waste</P>

<P><li> Allows for the purchase of bulk quantities of solvents</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> A complete roll, consisting of 60 wipes, must be prepared for use with this system</P>

<P><li> Wipes are disposed, not recycled</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>Halon 1301 (CAS: 75-63-8)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Halon 1301 is a widely used fire suppression and explosion protection agent applied in the total flooding manner.  It also has one of the highest ozone depletion potentials (or ozone depleting effects) of any compound, and thus its production and use are being  curtailed and eventually eliminated.  There are several substitutes approved by the EPA&#146;s Significant New Alternatives Policy  (SNAP) program, although none of them are truly ideal replacements and are all acceptable subject only to specific use conditions as cited in 40 CFR 82 Appendix A to Subpart G, &#147;Substitutes Subject to Use Restrictions and Unacceptable Substitutes.&#148;  The following substitutes are listed:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> HBFC-22B1 (an interim substitute at best, since its high ozone depletion potential qualifies it for phased out production by January 1, 1996), </P>

<P><li> HCFC-22, </P>

<P><li> HCFC-124, </P>

<P><li> HCFC Blend A, </P>

<P><li> HFC-23, </P>

<P><li> HFC-125,</P>

<P><li> HFC-134a,</P>

<P><li> HFC-227ea, and</P>

<P><li> Perfluorobutane (C<SUB>4</SUB>F<SUB>10</SUB>).</P>
</ul>

<P> Note: since all SNAP approved HCFCs and HFCs alternatives for Halon 1301 have very narrow use limits, extreme care must be taken when converting, retrofitting, or redesigning Halon 1301 systems, especially those for normally occupied areas.  In new buildings, non-halocarbon alternatives should be considered: water mists, foams, or carbon dioxide (for unoccupied space applications only).  Other products are in the testing stage; for example, C<SUB>3</SUB>F<SUB>7</SUB>H (FM-200), HFC-23, and the iodine analog of bromine containing Halon 1301, CF<SUB>3</SUB>I (Halon 13001).  Halon 1301 is, nevertheless, still approved for mission critical uses, but its procurement must come from the DLA Halon bank, since its production has already been phased out.</P>

<P>Halon 1301 is a brominated fluorocarbon used primarily for fire suppression and explosion prevention.  Because it is a severe ozone depleting substance, there is a serious effort to eliminate its use by developing and finding qualified substitutes.  The EPA has  developed a list of acceptable alternatives as an initiative of the SNAP program.  Although there are a number of approved alternatives to Halon 1301, it is critical that any alternative&#146;s applicability be verified, given the long list of qualifications and use  conditions to which each alternative is subject.  This wide variation in use conditions is mainly a result of physical property differences.  Some of these compounds are not as effective in extinguishing a fire, and so a higher concentration of the gas is required.  High gas concentrations also increase the sensitivity of personnel to cardiotoxicity and reduce available oxygen content; as a result, many of the use conditions require personnel evacuation in 30 seconds or less, a critical and sometimes impossible requirement to meet.  Each and every alternative for any application should be carefully reviewed for applicability to the Use Conditions.  For example, HFC-227ea can not be used in normally occupied areas at  concentrations greater than 10.5%.  In areas not normally occupied by people, HFC-227ea concentrations greater than 10.5% are allowed, provided that any personnel can escape the area within 30 seconds after discharge of the gas; furthermore, the area shall be secured so that unprotected personnel are prevented from entering the area during discharge.  Again, oxygen displacement and cardiotoxicity are the primary concerns.  The main factors to weigh when considering conversion to a Halon 1301 alternative are the following:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Are there non-halocarbon alternatives that would work for the application, such as water mist or foam systems?  If not, what are the halocarbon alternatives?</P>

<P><li> Is the candidate substitute EPA SNAP approved?</P>

<P><li> Has the candidate substitute been tested by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM)?</P>

<P><li> Does the candidate substitute conform with the National Fire Protection Association Standard for Clean Agent Extinguishing Systems (NFPA Standard 2001)?</P>

<P><li> Does the candidate substitute extinguishing agent have zero ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential?  If not it may also be targeted for replacement sometime in the future; for example, any HCFC substitute will eventually be phased out over the next 20 years per the Montreal protocol on ozone depleting substances.</P>

<p>Switching from Halon 1301 to an HCFC reduces the ozone depletion potential of the extinguishing agent, but does not eliminate it.  Switching to an HFC (all chlorine sites on the carbon molecule are fluorine substituted) or a perfluorocarbon (all available sites on the carbon molecule are fluorine substituted) provides a non-ozone depleting substitute, but also provides a gas with a not  insignificant global warming potential, particularly the perfluorocarbons.  Careful consideration of the choices is necessary in order to select the optimal alternative.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Hand pump spray bottles filled from bulk containers are a convenient method of reducing the use of aerosol cans.   This technology reduces the disposal of aerosol cans and the release of propellants.  Hand pump spray bottles can be refilled by pumping the solution from bulk containers such as 1-, 5-, 30-, or 55-gallon drums.  This method is best suited for cleaning solutions, lubricants, and other spray solutions that are available in bulk.  The spray bottles are composed of plastic and are compatible with most cleaning solutions and lubricants.  They are durable and can last for many refills.  Hand pumps are available to pump solutions directly from drums for use in the spray bottles.  For solutions which are in pails or buckets, there is a pail adapter to allow the use of the hand pump.  </P>

<P> The Navy&#146;s P2 Afloat Program is promoting this technology to replace many uses for aerosol cans.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> This technology is applicable to all spray solutions available in bulk which are compatible with the spray bottles.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces solid waste disposal</P>

<P><li> Reduces aerosol propellant discharge to atmosphere</P>

<P><li> Purchase in bulk is less expensive than purchase in aerosol cans</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Aqueous jet parts washers clean using a combination of water and detergent.  A parts washer is comprised of a cleaning cabinet in which spray nozzles, which are positioned along the interior walls and ceiling, direct heated, high pressure streams of water at the objects to be cleaned.  The high pressure water is typically used in conjunction with a detergent and will remove dirt, grime, oil, and grease from the materials being cleaned.</P>

<P> Because the detergent solution is biodegradable, the solution may be discharged into the local sewer system if it meets the discharge limitations.  However, most of the washers have a purifying/recycling system, whereby the detergent solution is recycled and can be reused.  These purifying/recycling systems work by skimming oil from the solution, and removing any sludge waste which has settled to the bottom of the washer.  In addition, filters used in the system remove particulate matter, further purifying the solution.  These closed-loop systems enable the user to reuse the detergent solution several times before requiring fresh solution.</P>

<P> The detergents used can come in two forms: water soluble liquid concentrate or water soluble powder.  Most contain a rust inhibitor and a lubricant to protect the parts from rust.  The detergents are formulated so that they can effectively remove carbon, heavy greases, and other dirt.</P>

<P> The washer units come in a variety of sizes, from a 75-gallon to a 400-gallon capacities.  The units are either front-loading or top-loading, depending on the model.  Parts are placed in baskets or on shelves, which rotate to expose the parts to the jet washers and the detergent solution.  The baskets can be multi-tiered, depending on the size of the washer and the parts being cleaned.  Options include rinse and dry modules, where the parts are given a final rinse with fresh water and dried using blasts of heated air.</P>

<P> Because the system uses biodegradable detergents, no hazardous solvents are used.  In addition, hazardous wastes will be minimized, reducing disposal costs.  However, because paints and metals may collect and form a sludge, hazardous wastes may still be generated, although on a smaller scale.</P>

<P> Aqueous jet parts washers are used throughout the Army, Navy, Marine Corp, and Air Force.  Aqueous jet parts washer are used to clean a variety of parts, including aircraft components and engine parts.  Closed loop aqueous jet parts washers have been used on-board Navy vessels to clean a variety of parts, including aircraft components.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The aqueous jet parts washer may be used on a wide variety of parts.  However, mild steel and tool steel fixtures may corrode if not treated with a rust inhibitor or dried properly.  Residues from aqueous cleaners, which may affect a part&#146;s performance, include phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, chlorides, hydrocarbon films, amines, and nitrates.  Because some detergents used are acidic or alkaline in nature, certain types of metals may become etched or tarnished.  However, this can be prevented by using inhibitors.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Since most aqueous cleaners are acidic or alkaline, personal protection equipment (PPE) should be worn; i.e. eye protection, gloves, etc..  In addition, some aqueous cleaners are petroleum based and may cause allergic reactions to susceptible individuals.  Also, caution should be exercised due to possible heat exposure.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Replaces hazardous solvents with biodegradable detergents</P>

<P><li> Minimizes the disposal of hazardous wastes</P>

<P><li> Spent water or detergent solutions may be discharged into the local sewer system if they meets the discharge regulations</P>

<P><li> Eliminates exposure to carcinogenic and neurotoxic chemicals</P>

<P><li> Meets state and local air regulations regarding ozone depleting substances (ODSs)</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> CFCs and HCFCs have been used as refrigerants since the 1930s.  Because of their ozone depleting effect and the eventual phaseout of the production of these chemicals, development of alternative refrigerants and refrigeration and air conditioning processes are becoming increasingly important.</P>

<P>Air conditioning and refrigeration use the principle of vapor compression to achieve a cooling effect.  This process has long relied on CFCs and HCFCs as the refrigerant materials of choice for use in the vapor compression process.  The discovery of their probable effect on the ozone layer has resulted in the development of alternative processes, as well as development of new refrigerants.</P>

<P>The first substitute refrigerants for CFCs and HCFCs have been developed and are known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), since they do not contain any chlorine atoms,  HFCs are already beginning to be used.  Due to the concern for future regulation of HFCs for global warming, other processes are being looked at to replace them in the long-term.</P>

<P><li> Vapor compression using hydrocarbons, ammonia, carbon dioxide, or water: Ammonia-refrigerated warehouses and industrial processes;  Hydrocarbons - industrial applications and more recently small appliances; Water - above 0 degrees C applications only, such as air conditioning; Carbon dioxide - stationary air conditioning, and potentially automobile air conditioning in the future; Being used in small appliances in many parts of the world, but not in  the U.S.</P>

<P><li> Evaporative cooling (direct and indirect):  Residential and industrial air conditioning systems</P>

<P><li> Gas expansion:  Transport of perishable substances</P>

<P><li> Absorption:  Industrial processes with excess waste heat but also needing refrigeration, gas fired systems are often used in remote areas where electrical costs are high or the supply of electricity will not meet demand, often used in conjunction with electrically powered vapor compression systems to reduce peak load power demands</P>

<P><li> Stirling Cycle:  Practical only for small applications</P>

<P><li> Air (Joule) Cycle:  Not practical in many applications due to high power requirements</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>  The common names for class I and class II ODSs are derived from each  compound&#146;s chemical formula.  Because the common names can be  relatively long, numbering systems were devised to more simply describe  each compound.</P>

<P>A numbering system describing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are class I ODSs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are class II ODSs, has been developed to simply and systematically name each compound.  The numbering system for both classes of compounds is the same (except for a slightly different numbering system used to describe the Halons and also the prefix before each number, which is simply CFC- or HCFC-, depending on the class to which that particular compound belongs).  For CFCs and HCFCs, the ones digit (last) indicates the number of fluorine atoms in each molecule, the tens digit represents the number of hydrogen atoms in each molecule plus one, and the hundreds digit represents the number of carbon atoms in each molecule minus one.  For example, trichlorotrifluoroethane is a CFC that has three fluorine atoms, no hydrogen atoms, and two carbon atoms in each molecule; hence, the designation CFC-113.  Since there are two carbon atoms and thus six sites available for halogens (chlorine or fluorine only, no bromine) and hydrogens, the number of chlorine atoms is determined by the difference between the total number of sites available and the sum of the hydrogen and fluorine atoms.  In this case, 6-(0+3) = 3, or the number of chlorine atoms.</P>

<P>The Halon numbering system uses four digits.  It is similar, but also a bit simpler, since the Halons, like the CFCs, are totally halogenated, lacking any hydrogen atoms.  The numbering system uses a simple count of the number of atoms of each element in the molecule from the ones digit to the thousands digit: bromine (Br), chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), and carbon (C), respectively. For example, the bromochlorodifluoromethane molecule has one bromine atom, one chlorine atom, two fluorine atoms, and one carbon atom; hence, the designation Halon 1211 or CF<SUB>2</SUB>ClBr.</P>

<P>It is possible to derive the common name or chemical formula of most of these compounds.  The numbered names have a lower case letter following the ones digit.  This letter indicates a particular isomer or arrangement of the molecule, but no other specific information to further establish the compound&#146;s exact identity.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>  Halocarbon (halogenated carbon based molecules, primarily carbons with  bromine, chlorine, or fluorine atoms as part of their molecular structure)  aerosol cooling sprays have long been used for troubleshooting circuit  boards; however, EPA regulations no longer allow the sale of either  product for this purpose.  Several alternatives are available that do not use  halocarbons.</P>

<P>  Circuit boards with suspected thermally intermittent components are  typically tested with CFC-12 or HCFC-22 during troubleshooting.  EPA  regulations have banned these materials from this application.  The  alternatives that are readily available and also environmentally innocuous  are the following:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Vortex cooling involves use of a vortex tube powered by compressed air.  This typically small, hand-held device uses shop air (8 to 15 SCFM @ 80-125 psig) passed through a vortex chamber to produce a cooling effect.  Outlet temperatures of approximately -30 degrees F are produced.  However, the supply air must be both clean and dry for proper operation of the vortex tube.</P>

<P><li> Liquid nitrogen from a dispenser flask can be used to spray at the component; however, care must be taken when using the nitrogen gun, as component temperatures can reach -270 degrees F.  Cost is around $500.</P>

<P><li> HFC-134a can also be used as a freeze spray in place of CFC-12 and HCFC-22, if compressed air and nitrogen are unavailable.  However, HFC-134a sprays have shown to produce higher levels of electrostatic discharge than either CFC-12 or HCFC-22.  One way to apparently overcome this problem is by adding small quantities of alcohol to the spray.  Others are investigating small reusable grounding devices.  In either case, check with the manufacturer before using.</P>

<P><li> The &#147;Sno Gun&#148; is another electrical component cleaner.  &#147;Sno Guns&#148; are used to clean and freeze electronic equipment with carbon dioxide, which is not an ODS, but does contribute to global warming since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.  Although not yet specifically approved for use by the Air Force, product testing and evaluation is ongoing.</P>
</ol>

<p> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Given the production phase-out of Class I CFCs, any purchases of new appliances would ideally be those having CFC-free refrigerants.  Refrigerators using HFC-134a are just coming to market, but portable room air conditioners use predominantly R-22, an HCFC and Class II ODS (with a lower ozone depleting potential than CFCs and scheduled for phaseout beginning 2015) and are not yet being replaced with an HFC substitute.</P>

<P>DOD policy is to avoid purchase of new equipment containing CFCs.  However, residential refrigerators and portable room air conditioners have not yet been mass produced using ODS-free refrigerants. Nevertheless, production of HFC refrigerators is expected soon, and purchases should be directed toward those new products if at all possible.  If this is not possible, then purchase a refrigerator using an HCFC; otherwise, an ODS waiver will be required for purchase of any item containing a CFC.  Procurement of portable room air conditioners containing HCFC-22 does not require a waiver and will most likely be allowed until the year 2000.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> CFCs and HCFCs are common blowing agents used in expansion of polymer foams, such as expanded polystyrene (STYROFOAM<SUP>&reg;</SUP>).  Most companies, however, have switched from using CFCs to using HCFCs as blowing agents or other alternative methods.</P>

<P> CFCs and HCFCs are used in expansion of polymer foams.  The trend is away from CFCs and toward HCFCs and other alternatives.  One new alternative to gas induced expansion is &#147;electroset&#148; technology.  Electrosetting materials are made up of ordinary resins mixed with an electrically polarizable aggregate that makes the resin semiconductive while in its liquid state.  The fluid resin is then heated electrically until, at a certain temperature, one constituent of the resin changes phase from liquid to gas, thus creating bubbles.  The rest of the resin then solidifies, resulting in an expanded foam.  By altering the applied electrical energy, qualities such as foam density and compressibility can be controlled.  Using alternating current in the process produces a homogeneous foam.  Direct current causes a thermal gradient in the resin resulting in foam with properties that vary within the foam matrix.  Molded items can also be produced.</P>

<P> A new fire-resistant insulation foam has also been developed by a Swiss company called Polypag.  Their foam is applied with a can, and the propellant is a blend of HFC-152A and dimethyl ether.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Sterilization equipment using ethylene oxide (EO) can sometimes develop leaks.  Detection systems are available to warn of EO presence; however, the detectors are also sensitive to CFCs and HCFCs, and thus can give false alarms.</P>


<P> CFCs and HCFCs are often used as part of the formulation for sterilizing agents.  Because the sterilizing agents are oxidizers, such as EO, and are usually very combustible, the CFCs/HCFCs serve as both fire suppressant and propellant.  EO is a suspected carcinogen, and CFCs and HCFCs are ODSs, so leak detection is a critical part of sterilization equipment maintenance.  Current detection systems for EO are also sensitive to CFCs and HCFCs, but since most products used are mixtures and not 100% EO, any leak detected, even if it is not high in EO, is cause for concern, and is probably an indication of a component problem.</P>

<P> Despite the fact that EO is a suspected carcinogen, some 100% EO (CFC and HCFC free) sterilizers are in development.  Also, some EO-free replacements have been produced (for example, hydrogen peroxide and ozone-based sterilizers), but they are not yet in widespread use.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Retrofitting or repairing an existing EO/CFC based sterilizer that is less than 5  years old to an EO/HCFC mixture-based sterilizer is cheaper than purchasing new equipment based on one of the new technologies.  It would be best if possible to delay purchases of any new sterilizers until the new technologies have been thoroughly evaluated.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Chlorofluorocarbon-12 (CFC-12) has been the refrigerant of choice for motor vehicle air-conditioning systems, until it was discovered to be an ozone-depleting substance.  New motor vehicle air conditioning systems are using the refrigerant Hydrofluorocarbon-134a (HFC-134a).  The imminent CFC production ban will force any CFC-12 based systems without access to reclaimed CFC-12 to convert fully to either HFC-134a or R-401C, or use a drop-in hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) blend.  The HCFCs do have ozone-depleting potential, and both HCFCs and HFCs are greenhouse gases having relatively high global warming potentials (GWPs).  Therefore, the EPA strongly recommends the containment and reclamation of these substitutes (closed-loop recovery systems provide a means to achieve the conservation of these refrigerants). This is an indication that future regulation of these compounds will only increase. One example is the &#147;no venting&#148; regulation of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 58 FR 92, Section 608(c)(2), page 28,664. This regulation requires users to recover HFCs and other alternative (to CFCs) refrigerants when servicing equipment, effective 15 November 1995.</P>

<P> CFC-12 is the refrigerant used by the majority of motor vehicle air conditioning systems currently in operation, particularly those manufactured prior to 1993. Atmospheric CFCs have been determined to be the primary cause of stratospheric ozone layer depletion over the last quarter century as these products have made their way into the atmosphere. The widespread use of CFCs not only in motor vehicle air-conditioning systems but in many other applications as well, has resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of atmospheric chlorine.  Atmospheric chlorine reacts with ozone and reduces its stratospheric concentration, thus destroying the ultraviolet radiation shielding ability provided by the ozone layer.</P>

<P>Conversion of a large number of motor vehicle air-conditioning systems currently using CFC-12 is likely, given the large number of existing CFC-12-based units in service and the production ban on CFCs beginning 1 January 1996.</P>

<P>It is certain that an increasing number of conversions will be done as CFC-12-based air-conditioning systems require servicing. There may be two options, depending on the vehicle, its system, and the geographic location. The use of HFC-134a or R-401C (an HFC/HCFC blend of 52 percent HCFC-124, 15 percent HFC-152a, and 33 percent HCFC-22) to retrofit a motor vehicle&#146;s CFC-12-based air-conditioning system would require change out of numerous components, including the old lubricant. Retrofits with both HFC-134a and R-401C are approved by the EPA&#146;s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. This type of conversion provides an ODS-free (in the case of HFC-134a) or very low ODS (using R-401C) refrigeration system.  The conversion is relatively expensive and may result in reduced or inadequate cooling capacity, especially at &#147;hot idle&#148; conditions.</P>

<P>Several HCFC blends have been developed to mimic the refrigerant characteristics of CFC-12 for use as drop-in replacements. Using drop-in replacements should result in equivalent cooling performance at a lower cost. HCFC blends are expected to be available for the converted systems until they reach the end of their useful life cycle, provided their production phaseout is not accelerated. The drop-in replacements are also SNAP approved.</P>

<P>Any motor vehicle air-conditioning system converted to an alternative, by law, must be evacuated and have its CFC-12 removed, recovered, and reused for servicing a vehicle not being converted.</P>

<p><b>Materials Compatibility:</b> Any HFC or any blends using solely HFCs are not compatible with mineral oil lubricants found in CFC-12 refrigerant systems. For conversions, manufacturers typically recommend triple-flushing the lubricant from the system before charging with HFC-134a. Flushing can usually be accomplished after removing and recovering the existing refrigerant by simply draining the existing mineral oil, either from an oil drain plug or by removing the compressor and draining from the suction line. In most automotive systems, 90 to 95 percent of the lubricant can be removed from the system in this manner. Larger systems may require multiple drainage points, particularly if there are low spots around the evaporator. In all conversions, measure the volume of lubricant removed and compare to the compressor/system specifications to assure that greater than 95 percent of the lubricant has been removed. If greater than 95 percent of the mineral oil lubricant has not been removed, flushing will be required (if the system shows poor heat transfer, the mineral oil residual is typically still too high). Equipment using HFC-134a and R-401C requires synthetic oils (although R-401C tolerates a higher proportion of mineral oil, since it contains two HCFCs, so triple flushing is probably not necessary for R-401C conversions), such as polyalkylene glycol or polyol ester lubricating oils.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The SNAP-approved refrigerants for motor vehicle applications have been developed to minimize safety and health concerns. They are non-flammable under all expected working conditions and have low toxicity. Personal protective equipment is not mandatory, but when working with refrigerants, use of safety glasses or chemical splash goggles is always recommended. For more information on the safety and health aspects of these refrigerants, consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the product MSDS prior to any refrigerant conversion.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Conversion and retrofits, along with recovery of the existing CFC refrigerant charge, reduces the amount of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) going into the environment.</p>

<h3>Economic Analysis:</h3>

<p>Conversions of motor vehicle air conditioning systems now using CFC-12 to HFC-134a are expected to be relatively expensive. A complete conversion will require replacement of the dryer, hoses, seals, refrigerant, and lubricant, and also flushing of the old lubricant. The cost of a complete HFC conversion for a typical automobile CFC-12 system is estimated between $500 and $1,000. In addition, because of the differing physical properties of the refrigerants, systems designed for CFC-12 and converted to HFC-134a may suffer some reduction in efficiency (up to 30percent less efficient according to some tests), and hence cooling ability.</p>

<p>Drop-in replacements of the HCFC blends are expected to be simpler and cheaper, since no flushing or changing of lubricating oils is required. Furthermore, component changes should be minimal, although new connections and tagging are required by law. refrigerant cost will likely be $8 to $10 a pound, with a typical system using 2 to 4 pounds. However, complete refrigerant replacement is required; "topping off" a CFC-12 system with an HCFC blend is not allowed. Cooling performance is expected to be comparable to the original systems operating with CFC-12.</p>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Plural component proportioning systems are self-contained epoxy paint proportioning and mixing systems.  These systems provide proper mixing and precise generation of paint required by an application and consequently generate minimal waste. </P>

<P> Epoxy paint mixtures are prepared by premixing a base and a catalyst, and combining them in appropriate proportions in a separate container.  After mixing and waiting the specified time, application of the paint to the workpiece may proceed.  Epoxy paint ingredients have a limited pot life once mixed which cannot be exceeded without affecting the characteristics of the paint.  If the pot life is exceeded, the mixture must be disposed, and the application equipment must be cleaned with a solvent.  Under conventional methods, the mixture is prepared by hand.  This frequently results in the generation of excess paint, which requires solvent cleanup and disposal of the paint and solvent as a hazardous waste.</P>

<P> Plural component proportioning systems are used in conjunction with application devices.  The proportioning and application system layout typically includes the following components: 1) proportioning pump module, 2) mix manifold, 3) mixer, 4) application device, 5) material supply module, and 6) purge or flush module.  These systems optimize painting operations by maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste generated.</P>


<P> The plural component proportioning system for epoxy paints provides total control of materials from container(s) to application.  They are accurate and can provide more consistent material quality than hand mixing.  These systems can also keep pace with higher production requirements.  They mix on demand (i.e. as the gun is triggered), which results in no significant quantities of wasted materials.  Material cleanup requires less labor and maintenance, and generates less waste because the mixed material can be purged with solvent from the mix manifold, mixer, hose, and applicator before it cures.  The plural component proportioning system is a closed system and, as a result, there are fewer spills, less contamination or waste to clean up, and less contact between personnel and potentially hazardous materials.  In addition, the proportioning system makes bulk purchase of material practical.</P>


<P> If an epoxy paint requires a significant induction time (15 minutes or longer) the plural component proportioning system can still be used, provided that the mixed paint is allowed to stand in a separate container prior to application.</P>

<P> No new wastestreams are generated using Plural Component Proportioning Systems as compared to conventional methods.</P>


<H3>Materials Compatibility:</h3>

<p>Material specification data for the epoxy paint materials needs to be evaluated with respect to the proportioning and application system components prior to specification of the actual system to ensure material compatibility.  The materials used for the pumps and packings need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Stainless steel and Teflon&#226; components do not pose compatibility problems with most materials used in epoxy paint operations.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Health concerns are dependent on the variety of paint that is used.  Inhalation of lead- and zinc chromate-based paints can lead to irritation of the respiratory system.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protection (PPE) equipment should be used.  These safety and health issues are also applicable when using conventional methods.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Plural component proportioning system provides total control of materials from container to application.</P>

<P><li> Paint is generated on an as-needed basis, eliminating the generation of excess paint.  Under conventional methods, this excess paint is frequently disposed of as a hazardous waste.</P>

<P><li> The use of cleanup solvents is minimized.</P>

<P><li> Less potential for spills.</P>

<P><li> Less contact between personnel and potentially hazardous materials</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantage:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Plural component proportioning systems need to be designed for specific applications.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</h3>

<p>Capital costs for plural component proportioning systems can range from $50,000 to $70,000 for systems that mix multiple materials or $6,000 to $7,000 for basic units that mix two materials.  Application systems are additional and their capital costs can range from $500 to $5,000.  Each application needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with respect to material and labor costs and savings.</P>

<P> The following is an example of the replacement of a hand-mixing paint operation with a relatively simple Plural Component Proportioning System.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Annual paint usage for hand mixing system:  4,000 gallons</P>

<P><li> Annual solvent usage for hand mixing system:  2,250 gallons</P>

<P><li> Annual labor required for equipment cleaning using hand mixing system: 250 hours</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Toluene (CAS: 108-88-3), Xylenes (CAS: 1330-20-7), Methyl Ethyl Ketone (CAS: 78-93-3), Acetone (CAS: 76-64-1), n-Butyl Alcohol (CAS: 71-36-3), Lead (CAS: 7439-92-1), Chromium (CAS: 7440-47-3), Zinc Compounds </P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The UNICOAT paint technology is a one coat painting system for aircraft that replaces the traditional two coat primer and topcoat systems.  Since only one coat is applied instead of two coats, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and waste generated from cleanup operations are reduced by 50 to 70%.</P>

<P> UNICOAT, developed by Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Warminster, is a self-priming topcoat for aircraft and other industrial applications that is applied directly to metal without a primer.  UNICOAT, which is formulated lead and chrome-free, replaces the two-coat system with a blend of organic and inorganic zinc compounds that are nontoxic.  UNICOAT, like traditional topcoats, is polyurethane; however, UNICOAT is different because corrosion inhibitors and adhesion promoters have been added.  UNICOAT has been used successfully on both Navy and Air Force aircraft.  It has demonstrated equivalent or superior performance compared to the toxic paints that have been used in the past.  A federal specification (TT-P-2756) has been developed for this technology.</P>

<P> The UNICOAT process does not contain chromates.  As a result, the waste streams generated with the UNICOAT process are less hazardous than conventional processes.  These waste streams include air emissions and wastes generated from cleanup operations.  Since the UNICOAT process is a one-coat process, pollution generated is reduced by approximately 50%.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Like traditional paint and primer applications, the surface to be painted needs to be appropriately clean.  To avoid adverse reactions, freshly painted wet surfaces must not be allowed to come into contact with alcohols, amines, water, or acids.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> UNICOAT contains VOCs (i.e. 420g/l).  Inhalation of these compounds is the primary concern.  Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Contains no toxic pigments (i.e. chromate, lead, etc.)</P>

<P><li> Reduces VOC emissions and hazardous waste generation by 50 - 70%</P>

<P><li> Paint and primer cost savings</P>

<P><li> Lightened paint weight on equipment and aircraft</P>

<P><li> Labor cost savings since only one coat is applied</P>

<P><li> Stripping cost savings since only one coat is applied</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A wet detention pond is a constructed pond that maintains a permanent pool of water within a designated area, and relies on physical, biological, and chemical processes to remove pollutants from storm water runoff. Pollutants removed include sediment, organic matter, dissolved metals, and nutrients. In addition, wet detention ponds control storm water flow which prevents downstream flooding. As storm water enters the pond, treated water is displaced and discharged into a receiving body of water. Enhanced treatment of storm water runoff can be achieved through extended detention and the use of aquatic plants in the perimeter of the pond. Sediment removal can also be increased through the use of a sediment forebay.</P>

<P> Before construction of a pond begins, local, state, and federal permits should be confirmed and approved for all aspects of construction including wetlands, water quality, dam safety, grading, erosion control, and land use. Wet detention ponds rely on the existence of a permanent pool of water within the pond and, therefore, should be placed in areas with adequate baseflow from groundwater or from the drainage area to maintain the permanent pool. Soils under the pond should have a low permeability (10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-6</SUP> cm/sec) to ensure future existence of the pond. Pond placement should take into consideration a topographic area that allows for maximum detention while requiring minimal earth removal, thus lowering construction costs. Pond construction should not be considered near land constraints such as utilities or underlying bedrock.</P>

<P> Pollutant removal in the pond is determined using one of two methods: solids settling and eutrophication. The solids settling method relies on pollutant removal through sedimentation and the eutrophication method removes nutrients using natural biological processes.  According to the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP), up to 2/3 of the sediments, trace metals, and nutrients are removed as a result of sedimentation within 24 hours. Other studies that looked at biological removal suggest hydraulic residence times (HRTs) close to 2 weeks to get adequate phosphorus removal. Documented removal efficiencies for wet detention ponds are as follows:</P>

</TABLE>

<P> <SUP>1</SUP><SUP> </SUP>hydraulic residence time varies<BR>
<SUP>2</SUP><SUP> </SUP>hydraulic residence time of 2 weeks</P>

<P> Two ratios are useful at predicting pollutant removal efficiencies: volume ratio and area ratio. Volume ratio (VB/VR) is the ratio of permanent pool storage (VB) to the mean storm runoff (VR). Area ratio (A/As) is the ratio of the contributing drainage area (A) to the permanent pool surface area (As). Both of these ratios are correlated with treatment efficiencies. Large volume ratios result in increased retention and treatment between storms while low pollutant efficiencies are achieved with low volume ratios.</P>

<P> Pool depth can play a critical role in pollutant removal and storage, but caution should be taken when increasing the depth of the pool. A pond with an HRT of 2 weeks would function optimally at depth ranges from 3 to 9 feet; shallower depths with the same pond surface area have shorter HRTs.</P>

<P> Water within the pond is discharged through a wet pond outlet. A wet pond outlet consists of a vertical riser, either concrete or corrugated metal, attached to a horizontal barrel that conveys storm water flow under the embankment to a receiving stream. The outlet is designed to pass excess water while maintaining a permanent pool. Risers are typically placed in or on the edge of the embankment and are capped with a trash rack to prevent clogging.</P>

<P> As with any storm water best management practice (BMP), proper maintenance will ensure continued proper functioning of the wet detention pond. Proper maintenance may include any or all of the following:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Clearing trash and debris</P>

<P><li> Conducting routine inspections of the embankment and spillway to check structural integrity and look for signs of erosion or animal habitation</P>

<P><li> Conducting periodic repairs on the embankment, emergency spillway, inlet, and outlet</P>

<P><li> Removing sediment and algae</P>

<P><li> Removing large vegetation or trees from the embankment that could potentially weaken the embankment</P>

<P><li> Maintaining the outfall area (i.e., replacing rip-rap, removing sediments, etc.)</P>
</ul>

<P> Sediments collected by the wet detention pond typically meet toxicity limits and can be landfilled safely. Testing of the sediments may be required if the upstream drainage area is industrial and/or results in highly contaminated runoff. Non-toxic sediments can also be disposed on site, but away from the shoreline to prevent their re-entry into the pond. The removal of sediments in a pond may be necessary every 20 years. This can be decreased to every 50 years if a sediment forebay is used prior to the wet pond. The sediment forebay would require maintenance every 5 to 7 years.</P>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Wet detention ponds can decrease the potential for downstream flooding and streambank erosion, and provide increased downstream water quality. Water quality is improved through removal of suspended solids, metals, and dissolved nutrients using natural biological and physical processes. Properly designed and maintained wet detention ponds can also enhance landscape aesthetics as well as provide wildlife habitat.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>  Pond construction should not be considered near land constraints such as utilities or underlying bedrock.</P>

<P><li>  Sediments from upstream industrial or highly contaminated runoff areas may be a hazardous waste requiring special disposal/treatment.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Budgeting for construction of a wet detention pond should include costs for permitting, designing, constructing, and maintaining the pond. Costs will vary for permitting from state to state as will the construction of a pond in a developing area versus a developed area. Developing areas tend to be less costly, as there are less problems with existing utility and structure constraints. An average cost for a 1 acre, 5 foot deep pond with a storage volume of 180,000 cubic feet is $75,000.</P>

<P> Annual maintenance and operation costs typically range between 3 to 5 percent of construction costs. Maintenance costs include sediment removal, grass mowing, nuisance control (problematic animals), trash removal, and routine inspections. On-site sediment disposal should be utilized when possible, as costs can be reduced by as much as 50 percent.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Expanded insulating foams have become popular with the evolution of building codes in the last several years.  Codes now require impervious protection between certain walls and structures to improve fire resistance.  These foams can be applied where and when needed.  However, ODS and propane-free substitutes are preferable.</P>

<P> Expanded insulating foams are an important part of new building construction, given strengthened building codes.  These foams are used to seal holes between walls especially where pipes or conduits penetrate the walls.  Since the expanded foams are made from isocynate materials, no isocynate-free substitutes exist.  Some foams may, however, contain more innocuous propellants than propane and ODSs, but these are not readily available.</P>

<P> Fire stop compounds are acceptable alternatives to expanded insulating foams and should meet the latest building codes.  The only application in which a foam would normally be required is where an object passing through a wall or floor will shrink in a fire; for example, polyvinyl chloride piping.  However, the expanded foam can be avoided in this case also by wrapping an intumescent collar around the pipe and applying a fire stopping joint compound around the annular opening.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A vortex solids separator is a wastewater treatment unit, containing no moving parts, designed to physically remove solids and floatables from wastewater or storm water. The unit is cylindrical in design so that, as flow enters the unit tangentially, it induces a swirling vortex which concentrates solids at the bottom of the unit in the underflow. Vortex solids separators are used for both combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and separate storm events. During CSO events, concentrated solids are collected and removed from the bottom of the unit through a sanitary sewer and discharged to a wastewater treatment plant. During separate storm water events, concentrated solids can be removed through the bottom of the unit and sent to a holding tank or pond, where further sedimentation will take place. Clarified effluent exits through the top of the unit and is returned to the receiving water. Vortex units can be installed on line or off line in a system. The units can also be designed to be used individually or in a series of units. Vortex units can be designed to be used in combination with other best management practices (BMPs).</P>

<P> The design of a vortex solids separator should be based on the anticipated type and quantity of pollutants to be removed, as well as the settleability characteristics of those pollutants. The quantity of flow to be treated should be established prior to the design phase to achieve the desired treatment level. Pilot-scale testing should be conducted during the design phase to determine the swirl treatability at each site.</P>

<P> Unit performance is based on the vortex separation mechanism for which each type has its own design criteria for solids/liquids separation. The design criteria for the Swirl, which is available to the public from the EPA, is based on settleability studies developed in the 1970s. Design specifications and pilot-scale treatability studies are required for each site-specific application.</P>

<P> Data collected from solids removal studies indicate vortex solids separators are effective at removing gritty materials, heavy particulates, and floatables from storm water, but ineffective in removing materials with poor settleabilities.  The net solids have been calculated for various units in use for CSO applications. Net solids account for those solids collected as a result of swirl concentrating.  Net solids removal ranged between 7 and 34 percent. During separate storm water applications, the average net mass solids removal ranged from 12 percent for the pilot-scale Storm King in Bradenton, Florida, to 17 percent for the Swirl in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. The following table presents average performance characteristics of commercial Vortex Separators collected from four units.</P>

<P> Vortex solids separators have limited effectiveness in use with wet-weather flows, as evidenced by the low net solids removal percentages (7 to 34 percent). The low removal rates documented for vortex separators may not meet water quality treatment objectives for proposed locations. Little information is available for vortex solids separators treating pollutants other than solids.</P>

<P> An advantage of vortex separators is the small land requirement as compared to other BMPs (i.e., wet ponds). Vortex unit construction constraints include the ability of the soil to support the unit, the depth of soil, and the slope of the site, which may determine whether an above- or below-ground unit is used. Improvement to the separator includes using pretreatment to reduce the pollutant load to the separator. Maintenance for most separators includes a wash down after every CSO event to prevent odors. This would not be necessary for a storm water application. Some units have a self-washing mechanism.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Proper design, operation, and maintenance of the equipment is required for its safe use.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Vortex solids separators are able to separate solids and floatables from storm water and waste water using a swirling vortex. They can be used in instances where a separation technology is limited by space or land constraints, such as surface slope or soil composition. Vortex separators have no moving parts and, therefore, are not maintenance intensive.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Vortex solids separators have limited effectiveness in use with wet-weather flows; </P>

<P> <li> may not meet water quality treatment objectives for proposed locations. </P>

<P> <li> Limited information is available for vortex solids separators treating pollutants other than solids</P>
</ul>


<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Budgeting for construction of a vortex separator unit should include predesign costs, capital costs, and operation and maintenance costs. The predesign costs for a Storm King are typically $21,000, and between $27,000 and $106,000 for the Fluidsep. Settleability curves published for the Swirl can be used as the basis for design and eliminate predesign costs. Capital costs for vortex solid separator treatment facilities in the US are site specific and vary between $3,200 and $5,600 per acre of drainage basin. The capitol cost for an individual unit alone is approximately $5,200 per mgd.</P>

<P> Energy requirements for most vortex solid separators is nonexistent unless the facility requires pumping. Washdown costs for vortex separators primarily include labor or energy costs for an automatic washdown. The Surrey Heath Storm King facility lacks a foul sewer line and collects residuals in a collection zone. These residuals are periodically emptied every 2 to 3 years, which is estimated to cost between $300 and $500 per cleaning.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Bulk paint storage in 30-gallon heavy-duty conical-bottom polyethylene tanks is a method of reducing solid waste volume.  Paint is purchased in 5-, 15-, and 30-gallon containers instead of 1-gallon or pint cans.  Purchasing paint in larger containers reduces the volume and mass of empty paint containers disposed.  In addition,  the amount of paint lost to clingage on the interiors of the empty paint containers is also reduced.</P>

<P> The 30-gallon polyethylene tanks have a mount on the bottom for a pneumatic agitator to assure that the paint is well mixed while it is being dispensed.  At the time of use, the paint is dispensed into re-useable, transportable containers which are taken to the painting site.  After painting, unused and uncontaminated paint can be returned to bulk storage and the transporting container cleaned for future use.</P>

<P> This pollution prevention method is useful for paints that are commonly used.  In addition to reducing solid wastes and the associated landfill fees, this method can result in a lower paint purchase cost.  Buying paint in bulk usually results in a cost savings.  </P>

<P> 30-gallon heavy-duty conical-bottom polyethylene storage tanks for bulk paint storage are being put onboard ships under the Navy&#146;s P2 Afloat Program.  </P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> None</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Health concerns are dependent on the variety of paint used.  When using lead and zinc chromate paints, inhalation of lead or zinc can irritate the respiratory tract and can be poisonous.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protective equipment should be used.  </P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduced paint purchase costs</P>

<p><b>Usage List:</b> Navy: High; Army: High; Air Force: High</p>

<P><B>Substitute for: </B>Cyanide Based Nickel Stripping Processes</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Nickel (CAS:  7440-02-0), Cyanides, and Chlorine (CAS:  7782-50-5)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>Non-cyanide based metal stripping removes metal based coatings from production parts by dipping the parts in a bath solution, and rinsing.  Using a non-cyanide based metal stripping process reduces the volume of hazardous waste generated and the associated disposal costs, and exposure of personnel to hazardous materials and wastes.</P>

<P>Until recently, the majority of stripping of metal coatings from production parts has been accomplished using cyanide based processes.  Parts that require rework often need to remove previously applied metal coatings.  Cyanide based processes are capable of removing many different metal coatings such as nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), gold (Au), and other precious metals without damaging the surface of the part itself.  The downside of cyanide-based stripping is that cyanides are hazardous to personnel, frequent bath solution change-outs due to a limited bath life, and the rinse streams generated from this process contain high concentrations of metals and cyanides.  The rinse water generated requires treatment to remove the cyanides and metals at the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) before the water can be released to the Public Owned Treatment Works (POTW).  The treatment process at the IWTP requires the use of toxic chemicals such as sulfuric acid, caustic, chlorine and other hazardous materials.</P>

<P>There are a number of commercially available non-cyanide metal stripping processes that can be implemented to replace cyanide-based metal stripping processes.  These alternative metal strippers use amines, aromatic nitro compounds, protein based and other oxidizing chemicals.  The following process parameters must be examined for any alternative before implementation can occur:  stripping rate, corrosion of base metal, reaction with maskants, bath stability, and treatability of rinse waters or spent process bath material.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Due to the variability of non-cyanide based bath solutions, it is highly recommended that the activity reference the vendors data for specific incompatibilities between bath solution and other materials / chemicals.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Many components of a non-cyanide metal stripper are biodegradable and present minimal safety risks.  However; several components do present splash, heat and vapor hazards.  Bath solution temperatures range from room temperature to 180 &#176;F, appropriate precautions shall be observed.  Nickel compounds can be skin irritants.  Proper personnel protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P>Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits: </H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Elimination of a major source of cyanides</P>

<P><li> Reduction of costs and materials required for cyanide treatment of rinse waters at IWTP</P>

<P><li> Non-cyanide baths are also more stable and require less frequent change-out</P>

<P><li> The removal of cyanides may enable the reclamation of metals from the bath solution and rinse water</P>

<P><li> The same process equipment (tanks, heaters or coolant coils) that is currently used can be used in the non-cyanide based process</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Due to the variability of bath solutions available, it is possible that new waste streams may be created</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis: </H3>

<p>Non-cyanide nickel strippers can be implemented using existing tanks, heaters, and ventilation systems. The only cost variable will be for the initial make up for the process bath, but that will be offset by the fact that non-cyanide baths have a much higher bath life than cyanide baths (2 to 3 times). Also, eliminating the cost (chemicals and labor) for the treatment of cyanide contaminated rinse waters will yield greater savings.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p>Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>Utilizing the Electroless Nickel (EN) bath life extension technology to augment current EN operations can increase the life of the plating bath at a typical naval facility up to ten-fold, reduce the volume of hazardous waste generated by up to 90 percent and the associated disposal costs.  The EN bath life extension technology accomplishes this by performing two functions:  1) it removes the chemical by-products formed during the plating process, and 2) maintains the overall chemical balance of the EN plating bath (nickel concentration, pH, temperature) through the addition of bath chemicals (hypophosphite, reducing agents, complexing agents, and bath stabilizers).  EN plating consists of a chemical process in which a reaction occurs to reduce nickel ions to metal which deposit onto the part.  Current practice is to changeout the plating bath solution as it becomes loaded with contaminates that interfere with the plating process and dispose of it as hazardous waste.  Typical EN wastestreams include orthophosphite, sulfate, and sodium ions.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p>Nickel compounds can be irritating to the skin. Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P>Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li>Decrease the volume of hazardous waste generated by up to 90% and the associated disposal costs</P>

<P><li> EN bath life can be increased up to ten-fold</P>

<P><li> EN bath will require minimal chemical additions versus six to twelve annual  bath change-outs </P>

<P><li> Improved production quality due to stability of plating bath parameters and quick removal of bath impurities that can cause poor plating quality</P>

<P><li> Reduction of rework required due to poor plating quality</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>

<P><li>Moderately high capital costs</P>

<P><li> Increased handling and exposure to workers from the addition of plating bath chemicals</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p>Variables affecting capital cost, operation &amp; maintenance costs, and the hazardous waste disposal costs with regard to the addition of an EN bath life extension system include:</P>
<ul>

<P>- Capacity and size of the plating bath</P>

<P>- Quantity of work to be processed</P>

<P>- Ability to stabilize bath characteristics and remove impurities.</P>

<P><li> Assumptions for Cost Comparison</P>

<P>- Volume of EN plating bath solution, 500 gal.</P>

<P>- ENFINITY EN bath life extension technology will be implemented (Implementation requires the use of the vendors EN system in conjunction with the bath life extension technology)</P>

<P>- Chemical replenishing costs based on plating thickness per square footage of work processed.  The ENFINITY vendor estimates a process cost of $1.97 per mil&#215;ft<SUP>2</SUP> </P>

<P>(1 mil = 0.001 inches)</P>

<P>- No additional labor costs, savings associated with fewer bath change-outs will be offset by need to add chemicals, clean and recondition EN plating tank</P>

<P>- Bath life extended 5-fold</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: Low</P>

<P><B>Substitute for: </B>Chromic Acid Aluminum Anodizing Process</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Chromic Acid (CAS: 7738-94-5), Chromium (CAS:  7440-47-3).</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>The Sulfuric/Boric Acid Anodizing (SBAA) process is a direct replacement for the Chromic Acid Anodizing (CAA) process used on aluminum production pieces.  The SBAA process consists of a sulfuric/boric acid anodizing bath and a chromate sealer bath.  SBAA is a commercially available and tested process that provides a protective coating meeting all military and industrial specifications that the CAA process does.</P>

<P>The CAA process is currently used by all Naval Aviation Depots (NADEPs), Naval Shipyards, and other activities to apply a protective coating to aluminum parts used by many naval aircraft and ships.  CAA generates chrome containing waste streams from the rinsing of parts and ventilation system  washdowns.  The resulting CCA rinse water requires the removal of metals at the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) prior to release to a Public Owned Treatment Works (POTW).  The SBAA process has no chrome except for a small amount in a separate sealer tank (70 ppm compared to 74.9x10<SUP>3</SUP> ppm in CAA) that the parts need to be dipped into after the SBAA process; therefore, no chrome containing waste streams are generated from the rinsing of the parts and the ventilation system.  The rinse water stills contain metals and acids that must be treated at the IWTP prior to release to a POTW.</P>

<P>The SBAA process was tested by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) at NADEP North Island and has been approved by NAVAIRSYSCOM as an alternative to the CAA process.  The SBAA process has since been implemented at NADEP North Island and NADEP Cherry Point.  Mil-C-8625C (the Mil-Spec that governs all anodized coatings) is being revised to include the SBAA process as an additional option for aluminum anodizing.</P>


<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>


<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Sulfuric acid can be extremely corrosive to skin tissue. Contact with the body can result in severe burns. Boric acid can be a dermal and mucous membrane irritant. It is also a suspected teratogen and mutagen. Chromic acid can irritate the respiratory tract and mucous membranes, and is a known mutagen. Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>


<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits: </H3>
<ul>

<P><li> Replace a major source of Chromic Acid in the Navy</P>

<P><li> Significant reduction in the treatment of chromic acid at the IWTP</P>

<P><li> Reduction of toxic air emissions from the chromic acid process</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>

<P><li> Still generates a hazardous waste stream requiring pre-treatment</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Cost savings will depend largely on the volume of chromic acid contaminated rinse water generated, rinse water treatment costs, and the hazardous waste disposal costs for the heavy-metals-contaminated sludge.  The cost to implement the SBAA process is minimal at a facility that currently utilizes CAA.  Additional equipment requirements include:</P>
<ul>

<P>- Sealer tank</P>

<P>- Immersion heater or steam line  for the sealer tank</P>

<P>- Cooling coils for the SBAA to keep bath temperature below 80 &#176;F</P>

<P><li> Process Parameters and Assumptions for Cost Comparison</P>

<P>- CAA, SBAA and sealer bath capacities: 2,800 gal each</P>

<P>- Sulfuric/Boric Acid bath : 30-50 g of sulfuric acid per liter of bath fluid, 5-11 g of boric acid /l of bath fluid, 76-84 &#176;F</P>

<P>- Sealer bath : 26g of chromic acid per 100 gal of bath fluid, 190-200 &#176;F</P>

<P>- No differential in labor, permitting, training, etc.  Personnel operating the CAA process can be trained to operate the SBAA equipment</P>

<P>- Operating costs are equivalent for both processes with the exception of bath make-up costs</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Freon R-12 (CFC-12) is used in aerosol containers to cool electronic components during isolation and repair.  Many manufacturers are phasing out these sprays and are introducing alternatives that protect the ozone layer.  Carbon dioxide can be used as a replacement coolant for Freon R-12 sprays.  The COMP-CO<SUB>2</SUB>LD or CC-1 component cooler, manufactured by Va-Tran Systems, is a viable alternative to freon CFC sprays used in electronic component cooling applications.  This CO<SUB>2</SUB> spray tool was originally designed and manufactured to remove submicron particle contamination in the semiconductor and hybrid circuit industry.  Allied-Signal demonstrated that the CC-1 component cooler performs better than CFC-12.  The CC-1 component cooler requires a shorter blast to cool the components to the required temperature.  This results in faster detection of weak or defective components.</P>

<P> The CC-1 component cooler consists of a CO<SUB>2</SUB> cylinder, a cart to make it portable, and a hand-held dispenser.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> cylinders are typically procured in 20-lb containers although other sizes are available.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> is stored as a liquid under about 850 psig of pressure.  As it vaporizes, its temperature can drop to less than -100 degrees F allowing for the formation of tiny dry ice particles.  The CC-1 component cooler is not only &#147;ozone-safe&#148; but is also considered a low-cost, effective option for electronic component cooling.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Carbon dioxide is an inert gas with excellent material compatibility as a cooling agent, especially since contact is typically of short duration.  Use of carbon dioxide can possibly cause material fracture in those applications requiring prolonged contact or in temperature sensitive components.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Since carbon dioxide can be an asphyxiating gas, CO<SUB>2</SUB> monitors should be considered for use in any confined space, clean room, or other space with limited ventilation.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Use of the CC-1 component cooler as an alternative to CFC-12 will reduce the amount of ozone-depleting chemicals entering the environment</P>

<P><li> Although not quite as convenient as freon CFC aerosol spray cans, the CO<SUB>2</SUB> hand-held spray tool is relatively convenient to use and can be adapted for a high degree of portability</P>

<P><li> CO<SUB>2</SUB> is non-corrosive and leaves no residue</P>

<P><li> The CO<SUB>2</SUB> spray tool speeds up the rate of defect detection.  A shorter blast of coolant is used to chill the components to the required temperature.  Using less coolant can result in cost savings</P>

<P><li> Cost savings are achieved from the lower cost associated with the CO<SUB>2</SUB> cylinders when compared to the Freon R-12 cylinders.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> The CO<SUB>2</SUB> spray tool will require an initial hardware cost.  However, this up-front cost is minimal (less than $630 for a 20-lb cylinder system). </P>

<P><li> CO<SUB>2</SUB> is a global warming gas.  However, CO<SUB>2</SUB> is considered to have relatively low global warming potential (GWP)</P>

<P><li> The CC-1 component cooler is not as convenient as CFC-12 aerosol spray cans.  Aerosol cans can be used frequently by several individuals at any given time.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> spray tool is expected to be more limiting in terms of users.  Although the CO<SUB>2</SUB> spray tool can be made portable, its use will not be as flexible as the aerosol cans.</P>

<P><li> The CO<SUB>2</SUB> canisters will require refilling.  Refilling costs are expected to be minimal (about $10 for each 20 lb. canister excluding any freight charges).  Freight charges can be higher than the refilling costs.  A 20-lb. canister can weigh up to 48 lbs. once filled.  Local welding distributors may be able to refill the canister without requiring freight charges.  Since only a small amount of CO<SUB>2</SUB> is needed to cool the component, the canister is expected to last a long time before refilling is needed.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The capital cost of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> component cooler (COMP-CO<SUB>2</SUB>LD) system includes the control unit, a 20 lb. cylinder, and a cart which is used to make the system portable.  </P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Capital cost of a complete CO<SUB>2</SUB> component cooling system (20-lbs) is $600</P>

<P><li> Cooling power of one 20 lb CO<SUB>2</SUB> cylinder is approximately equal to one 30 lb CFC-12 cylinder</P>

<P><li> Approximately 9,000 lbs of CFC-12 are used annually</P>

<P><li> Approximately 6,000 lbs of CO<SUB>2</SUB> would be needed annually to replace CFC-12 usage</P>

<P><li> Labor: 1000 hrs/yr @ $30/hr</P>

<P><li> Cost of a 30 lb. CFC-12 cylinder is $105</P>

<P><li> Disposal cost of CFC-12 aerosol cans is $0.015/lb @ 1,000 lb</P>

<P><li> Refilling (maintenance) cost of a CO<SUB>2</SUB> cylinder is $10</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Section 612 of the Clean Air Act stipulates that the EPA create a list of acceptable chemical and process alternatives to Class I and Class II ozone-depleting substances.  The list, created in March of 1994, includes substitutes for major industry applications such as aerosols, adhesives, coatings, inks, foam blowing, fire suppression, refrigeration, solvents, sterilants, and tobacco expansion.  As a result of the SNAP list, the Clean Air Act makes it illegal to replace any Class I or Class II substance with an alternative that has been identified as hazardous to human or environmental health when acceptable alternatives are available.  Any person can petition the EPA for inclusion of certain alternatives on future revised lists of approved substitutes.  The framework of the SNAP program is included in Subpart G of 40 CFR Part 82.  The original SNAP listing separates alternatives by industry application. Revisions from August 1994, September 1994, and January 1995 are included as revisions at the end of the original SNAP listings. The latest updated list is available from the Stratospheric Protection Hotline relating generic names to trade names.</P>

<h3>Material Compatibility:</h3> 

<P>Materials compatibility is based on the alternative procedure or chemical implemented. Considerations include the possibility of corrosion, swelling, deformation, and damage to coatings and adhesives. Testing will reveal particular types of damage to parts: stress, embrittlement, and total immersion corrosion.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p>Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDSs prior to implementing any of these recovery, recycling, or reclaiming processes.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances and EPCRA-targeted chemicals going into the environment.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>Potential substitutes not listed on the SNAP list may or may not actually be acceptable. Check with the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Hotline for the latest information from the EPA, especially for recent decisions or where a decision about a particular potential substitute is pending.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Any SNAP-listed substitute process or chemical needs to be evaluated for a given application in order to determine the economic impact a specific substitution will have. Regardless of any substitute&#146;s cost, taxes on CFCs will continue to rise.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Mixtures of refrigerants are used in special applications where a specific physical property of the refrigerant mixture is more  desirable or is not available by using one of the pure compounds. Often, these refrigerant mixtures or blends contain an ozone- depleting substance (ODS). This is the case for most of the R-500 blends because they are formulated using one chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and either a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or a  hydrofluorocarbon (HFC). Given the imminent production ban and the scheduled use phaseout of CFCs, alternatives have to be substituted.</P>

<P> R-500 series refrigerants are refrigerant blends that have been developed and used for many applications. The 500 series refrigerants are all refrigerant mixtures made up of two components, a CFC and an HFC or an HCFC (except for the new generation of the series R-507, which is a mixture of two HFCs). The mixtures are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> R-500, azeotropic mixture of 73.8% CFC-12 and 26.2% HFC-152a (1,1-difluoroethane)</P>

<P><li> R-501, mixture of CFC-12 and HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane)</P>

<P><li> R-502, azeotropic mixture of 51.2 % CFC-115 and 48.8% HCFC-22</P>

<P><li> R-503, azeotropic mixture of 59.9% CFC-13 and 40.1% HFC-23 (trifluoromethane)</P>

<P><li> R-504, mixture of CFC-115 and HCFC-132 (dichlorodifluoroethane)</P>

<P><li> R-505, mixture of CFC-12 and HCFC-31 (chlorofluoromethane)</P>

<P><li> R-506, mixture of CFC-114 and HCFC-31</P>

<P><li> R-507, azeotropic mixture of 50% HFC-125 (pentafluoroethane) and 50% HFC-143a trifluoroethane), is a new ODS-free replacement for R-502</P>
</ul>

<P>Replacements for the R-500 series refrigerants depend on the application, but there are numerous EPA Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program-approved substitutes, both products and processes, for most applications now using R-500, R-502, and R-503. For a list of the approved alternatives to these three blends, see the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheet, &#147;US EPA&#146;s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program.&#148; The EPA SNAP list is from Table 1 of 59 FR 13146, and also Appendix A to Subpart G of 40 CFR 82. Also see the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheets on, &#147;R-500: Uses, Restrictions, and Replacements,&#148; &#147;R-502: Uses, Restrictions, and Replacements,&#148; or, &#147;R-503: Uses, Restrictions, and Replacements,&#148; for more detailed information about applications and substitutes for the individual blends.</P>

<P>Acceptable replacements for R-501, 504, 505, and 506 have not yet been identified by the EPA.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Although refrigerant development has focused on relatively inert and non-toxic compounds, some products are not compatible with certain lubricants, plastics, and elastomers, while others exhibit a moderate degree of toxicity. Always check with the original equipment manufacturer to verify material compatibility.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Refrigerants tend to be relatively non-toxic; however, see the individual Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheets for more specific information about the acceptable alternatives and their material compatibility concerns. Also, consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDSs before converting to any of the alternative products or processes.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) solvents, including MCF and CFC-113, are used extensively for cleaning metal, electronic, and precision parts during aircraft maintenance procedures.  These solvents are also used in applications such as coatings, adhesives, lubricant carriers, and mold release agent carriers.  However, CFC-113 and MCF are EPA Class I ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and have been banned from production as of January 1, 1996. DoD policy is that CFCs and Halons can only be used for mission critical applications. Fortunately, numerous ODS-free alternatives are now available to replace CFC-113 and MCF.  In many instances solvent use can even be reduced or eliminated</P>

<P> Cleaning for aircraft maintenance can, for the most part, be divided into three categories: metal, electronics, and precision cleaning. Metal cleaning refers to the removal of oil or grease from metal parts during maintenance and repair procedures. Landing gear and control surfaces fall under metal cleaning. Electronics cleaning includes the removal of flux from soldered operations. Encompassing both metal and electronics cleaning, the term &#147;precision cleaning&#148; is not as much a function of the component being cleaned, as it is of the level of cleanliness required. Components typically requiring precision cleaning are those with close tolerances, complex geometries, or sensitive to contamination. There are aircraft components that fall into all three categories.</P>

<P> The following suggestions are directed primarily at typical aircraft maintenance functions.</P>

<P><B>Cleaning Applications</B></P>

<P> The first step in eliminating the use of CFCs in aircraft maintenance is to characterize all cleaning steps.  What parts need to be cleaned?  What is the substrate and contaminant being cleaned?  How clean does the part need to be?  By identifying the cleaning needs, a proper alternative can be chosen. Certain materials are subject to corrosion, swelling, deformation, and damage to coatings and adhesives if the proper cleaning alternative is not chosen.  Complexity of the part dictates whether vapor degreasing or aqueous cleaning should be used.  Vapor degreasing works best for cleaning complex parts.  Some cleaning steps may be identified that can be reduced, consolidated, or eliminated.</P>

<P> Most aircraft cleaning falls into two general cleaning processes: cold cleaning and vapor degreasing.  In cold cleaning processes, parts are cleaned by either immersion and soaking, spraying, or wiping with ambient temperature solvents.  The vapor degreasing process uses a boiling solvent to effect cleaning.  A volatile solvent such as CFC-113 or MCF is heated in a reservoir below a suspended part.  Solvent vapors rise to the top of the cleaning vessel and are condensed into droplets.  The solvent droplets fall onto the part, dissolving contaminants.  As the droplets collect and fall, contaminants are carried off the part and into the solvent reservoir.  Since the contaminants are generally low or non-volatile, solvent vapors remain essentially pure; effective cleaning is maintained despite the increasing contamination of the solvent reservoir.</P>

<P> The following table lists cleaning operations and alternatives associated with aircraft maintenance.  Detailed information concerning the elimination of CFC-113 and MCF, as well as explanations about many alternative cleaning agents and techniques available, such as aqueous, semi-aqueous, aliphatic hydrocarbon, and chlorinated and organic solids systems, can be found in the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheets listed above.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Materials compatibility depends on the alternative solvent/procedure implemented. Considerations can include corrosion, damage to coatings and adhesives, and swelling and deformation (especially for organic substitutes: alcohols, ketones, ethers, chlorinated solvents, etc.). Testing will reveal damage.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Organic Solvents can be extremely flammable/combustible. Use only in areas with good ventilation. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are also flammable and have low occupational exposure limits. Consult the MSDS of particular solvents to ensure that solvent is used properly and all necessary safety requirements (i.e., personal protective equipment, increased ventilation, fire fighting equipment) can be met. In addition, consult your local Industrial Health specialist, local health and safety personnel, and the SNAP comments prior to converting to any replacement product.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances and EPCRA-targeted chemicals going into the environment.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p> Whenever a new cleaning procedure is implemented, there will be a certain amount of &#147;down time&#148; while the technicians learn the new process.  However, this is to be expected in any process improvement.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Because cleaning circumstances are so variable, the economic feasibility of substitute processes and chemicals needs to be evaluated for each application prior to conversion.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<P><B>Process Code:</B> Navy: ID-14-99; Air Force: IN07; Army: ELM</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: Low</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B>  Product listed under Technical Order T.O. 1-1-3 NSN 6850-00-909-3123 (powder form), NSN 6850-01-130-2451 (aerosol form)</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The NSNs listed above are approved for leak detection in fuel cells; however, both forms of the product contain CFCs and are no longer manufactured.  New products are undergoing performance testing, but no officially approved replacements have yet been selected.  Nevertheless, interim approval for the products in testing may be requested from your command.  Otherwise, fuel cell leak checks will have to be done visually until the new products are officially approved.</P>

<P> Non-destructive testing products are often dyes formulated with solvents, typically CFCs.  The specific leak detecting products referenced above contain CFCs.  As Class I ODSs, these solvents are subject to an imminent production ban (1 Jan 96).  As a result, the manufacturer of these leak detecting products has already eliminated CFC use in their process.  They did this by stopping production of the leak test products altogether.  In addition, the manufacturer is unfortunately not developing any replacements.  The Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) is performance testing alternatives, but formulation changes may be needed before any products are officially approved.  Any approved products will be added to the Qualified Products List.</P>

<P> Several products have had favorable test results; however, none are officially approved as of 31 Dec 94.  Field units should request interim approval from their respective commands until a substitute is officially approved.  If interim approval for one of the test products is not obtained, visual inspection will have to be relied upon to monitor fuel cell integrity.</P>

<P> The most promising replacements being tested are made by Keystone Aniline Corp.:</p>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> ODSs have seen wide use as corrosion inhibitors and moisture displacers.  Corrosion inhibitors and moisture displacers typically use ODS formulations.</P>

<P> Moisture displacement is one of the key factors in preventing and inhibiting corrosion.  ODSs have long served in corrosion inhibitor product formulations functioning not only to displace moisture, but also serving as the propellant for aerosol products.  However, ODS-free replacements are becoming available.  One such product now available is AV-30 (NSN 6850-01-355-3387) made by Dinol International.</P>

<P> HFCs are the next generation of refrigerants.  They will substantially replace all the CFCs and HCFCs, since they do not have ozone depletion potential.  At the present time, there are no restrictions regarding their use; however, a &#147;no venting&#148; regulation, per the Clean Air Act Amendments in 58 FR 92, Section 608(c)(2) page 28664, is scheduled to take effect 15 Nov 95 that will require users to recover HFCs and other alternative (to CFCs) refrigerants when servicing equipment, because although they are not ozone depleting substances, they are greenhouse gases and have global warming potential.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Portable hand-held Halon fire extinguishers have been one of the standard types of fire extinguishers in common use.  An ODS-free substitute must be found to replace the Halon units.  There is an Air Force ban on the purchase of Halons (since 1 Jan 93), but not the use of existing Halon systems.  Purchase of additional Halons would require that a waiver be granted by the appropriate authority based on the need and the availability of ODS-free alternatives.  Use of Halons must conform to DOD policy, which essentially limits their use to mission-critical applications.  Existing non-mission-critical Halon applications must find a substitute and  convert from the Halon-based system.  For example, Halon 1301 is  used in aircraft simulators, but those non-mission-critical systems must eventually be modified to use an alternate fire extinguishing agent in accordance with current USAF policy.  Furthermore, many automatically-activated Halon extinguishing systems have been deactivated and can now only be triggered manually.  In the event of a discharge, the systems are not to be recharged with Halon.  The onboard systems will be replaced when an acceptable substitute  is available.  ODS-free hand-held fire extinguishers are available; for example, carbon dioxide units or those with surfactant blends such as Cold Fire<SUP>TM</SUP>.  Reporting requirements for the Halon which is used in fire  extinguishing systems must be in accordance with AFI 32-7080.  The DoD-wide policy is currently being developed; it will be similar to AFI 32-7080 and it will be published in Apr 95.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Waterborne paints have been evaluated as alternatives to solvent-based paints.  The volatile organic compound (VOC) content of waterborne paints is significantly lower than conventional solvent-based paints, thereby reducing VOC emissions.  Waterborne (or latex) paints are composed of synthetic resins and pigments that are kept dispersed in water by surfactants.  They also contain small amounts of coalescing solvents.  Waterborne paints dry by evaporation of the water.  The coalescing solvents allow the particles of resin to fuse together (coalesce) as the water evaporates to form a continuous coating.  Waterborne paints must be protected from freezing and applied at a minimum temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</P>

<P> Waterborne paints reduce VOC emissions and worker exposure to hazardous air pollutants.  These paints can also reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated, depending on the type of paint used.</P>

<P> Fairchild Air Force Base (AFB), Washington, currently uses latex paint (DTM Acrylic Coating by Sherwin Williams Co.) for KC-135 aircraft interiors.  Since health and safety requirements for paint applications are significantly reduced or eliminated, waterborne paints are used in place of solvent-based paints.  Only the floors and removable parts are painted with other materials: epoxy paint (for the floors), and polyurethane (for removable parts).  Diluted latex paint waste is treated in the Fairchild AFB wastewater treatment plant, and solid latex paint waste is disposed at the Fairchild AFB waste-to-energy plant.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Waterborne paints can rust plain steel and sometimes they can attack aluminum.  Application equipment must be constructed of a corrosion-resistant material such as 316 stainless steel.</P>

<P> Waterborne coating material conducts high voltage electricity much more readily than solvent-based material.  As a result, the electrostatics in a waterborne system will only work if all wetted equipment is isolated from potential grounds.  Three methods can be used to avoid grounding out the electrostatics in a waterborne system: (1) isolate the entire paint system from electrical grounds; (2) isolate a small part of the wetted system with a voltage blocking device; and (3) indirectly charge the paint particles away from any of the wetted equipment.  Each method has its advantages and disadvantages and should be evaluated for the specific application.  The use of a voltage blocking device at each atomizer is often the most cost-effective method.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Health and safety issues are reduced significantly by using waterborne paints.  However, these paints contain coalescing solvents that can be slight irritants by inhalation.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<p><li> VOC emissions are significantly reduced</P>

<P><li> Waterborne paints are generally easier to apply and clean up</P>

<P><li> Good to excellent surface properties including gloss, rub resistance, anti-sealing effect, and non-yellowing film</P>

<P><li> Some waterborne paints allow overspray to be recovered and recycled, effectively increasing transfer efficiency</P>

<P><li> Disposal requirements for waterborne paint waste may be reduced, depending on local requirements and/or waste quantities</P>

<P><li> Dried waterborne paint waste may be disposed in landfills as non-hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Health and safety requirements for workers are significantly reduced or eliminated</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<ul><li> May have lower chemical and solvent resistance</P>

<P><li> Reduced temperature resistance</P>

<P><li> Waterborne coatings are sensitive to humidity.  Low humidity can cause coatings to dry extremely fast, creating craters in the final film.  High humidity can cause very slow drying times, resulting in sagging.</P>

<P><li> Quality of application is dependent on surface cleanliness.  The water&#146;s high surface tension prevents the wetting of some surfaces and causes poor coating flow characteristics.  Surfaces with grease and other contaminants are especially prone to this.</P>

<P><li> Emulsion coatings have poor penetration and adhesion properties on porous surfaces, e.g. wood.  Lack of these qualities prevents good adhesion to old, chalky surfaces.</P>

<P><li> Lower abrasive resistance</P>

<P><li> Requires wetted equipment to be isolated from potential grounds</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Solvent-based paint systems can usually be converted to waterborne paint systems with a limited capital investment.  The cost of waterborne paints will vary depending on the application used.  In general, the price of waterborne paints is comparable to the price of solvent-based paints.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Powder coating paint systems, also referred to as &#147;dry painting&#148;, eliminates volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and solvents, and produces superior surface finish. </P>

<P> There are four basic powder coating processes: electrostatic spraying, fluidized bed, electrostatic fluidized bed, and flame spray.  Electrostatic spraying is the most commonly used powder application method.  For all application methods, surface preparation (i.e. cleaning and conversion coating) is required to develop good coating adhesion substrate.  Characteristics of the four different powder coating application techniques are described below.</P>

<P> In electrostatic spraying, an electrical charge is applied to the dry powder particles while the component to be painted is electrically grounded.  The charged powder and grounded workpiece create an electrostatic field that pulls the paint particles to the workpiece.  The coating deposited on the workpiece retains its charge, which holds the powder to the workpiece.  The coated workpiece is placed in a curing oven, where the paint particles are melted onto the surface and the charge is dissipated. </P>

<P> In fluidized bed, powder particles are kept in suspension by an air stream.  A preheated workpiece is placed in the fluidized bed where the powder particles coming in contact with the workpiece melt and adhere to its surface.  Coating thickness is dependent on the temperature and heat capacity of the workpiece and its residence time in the bed.  Post heating is generally not required when applying thermoplastic powder coatings.  However, post heating is required to cure thermoset powder coatings completely.</P>

<P>From Misev, Tosko A. 1991. <I>Powder Coatings: Chemistry and Technology</I>, Table 6.4, p. 350.</P>

<P> Electrostatic fluidized beds are similar in design to conventional fluidized beds, but the air stream is electrically charged as it enters the bed.  The ionized air charges the powder particles as they move upward in the bed, forming a cloud of charged particles.  The grounded workpiece is covered by the charged particles as it enters the chamber.  No preheating of the workpiece is required.  However, curing of the coating is necessary.  This technology is most suitable for coating small objects with simple geometry.</P>

<P> The flame-spray technique was recently developed for application of thermoplastic powder coatings.  The thermoplastic powder is fluidized by compressed air and fed into a flame gun where it is injected through a flame of propane, melting the powder.  The molten coating particles are deposited on the workpiece, forming a film on solidification.  Since no direct heating of the workpiece is required, this technique is suitable for applying coatings to most substrates.  Metal, wood, rubber, and masonry can be coated successfully using this technique.  This technology is also suitable for coating large or permanently-fixed objects.</P>

<P> The choice of powders is dependent on the end-use application and desired properties.  Typically, powders are individually formulated to meet specific finishing needs.  Nevertheless, powder coatings fall into two basic categories: thermoplastic and thermosetting.  The choice is application dependent.  Generally, thermoplastic powders are more suitable for thicker coatings, providing increased durability, while thermosetting powders are often used when comparatively thin coatings are desired, such as decorative coatings.  The principal resins used in thermoplastic powders are vinyl, nylon, and fluoropolymer.  Thermosetting powders use primarily epoxy, polyester, and acrylic resins.</P>

<P> Powder coating virtually eliminates waste streams associated with conventional painting techniques.  These waste streams include air emissions, waste streams generated from air emission control equipment, and spent cleaning solvents.  Powder coating also greatly reduces employee exposure, and liabilities associated with liquid coating (wet solvent) use.  Because the powder is dry when sprayed, any overspray can be readily retrieved and recycled regardless of the complexity of the system  This results in shorter cleanup times.  In all cases, the dry powder is separated from the air stream by various vacuum and filtering methods and returned to a feed hopper for reuse.  Powder efficiency (powder particles reaching the intended surface) approaches 100 percent.  Other advantages over conventional spray painting include greater durability; improved corrosion resistance; and elimination of drips, runs, and bubbles.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Only workpieces that can be oven heated are suitable for coating by electrostatic, fluidized bed, and electrostatic fluidized bed application methods.  Hence, these technologies are most appropriate for relatively small, metal objects.  The flame-spray method allows powder coatings to be applied to other substrates such as wood, rubber, and plastic, and to large or stationary structures.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</h3>

<p>Powder and air mixtures can be a fire hazard when an ignition source is introduced.  The concentration of powder in air must be controlled to maintain a safe working environment.  Despite the absence of flammable solvents, any finely divided organic material, such as dust or powder, can form an explosive mixture in air.  This is normally controlled by maintaining proper air velocity across face openings in the spray booth.  In the dust collector, where it is difficult to maintain the powder concentration below the lower explosive limit, either a suppression system or a pressure relief device must be considered.  </P>


<P> Inhalation of the powders should be avoided, as this can cause irritation to the lungs and mucous membranes.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of this technology.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> An electrostatic paint spray system is a highly efficient technology for the application of paint to specific workpieces.  Negatively charged atomized paint particles and a grounded workpiece create an electrostatic field that draws the paint particle to the workpiece, minimizing overspray.</P>

<P> For this technology, an ionizing electrode, typically located at the paint gun atomizer tip, causes paint particles to pick up additional electrons and become negatively charged.  As the coating is deposited on the workpiece, the charge dissipates through the ground and returns to the power supply, completing the circuit.  The electrostatic field influences the path of the paint particles.  Because the charged particles are attracted to the grounded workpiece, overspray is significantly reduced.  Paint particles that pass a workpiece can be attracted to and deposited on the back of the piece.  This phenomena is known as &#147;wrap&#148;.</P>


<P> The transfer efficiency is the percent of sprayed paint that is applied to the workpiece.  Paint that is not applied to a workpiece is captured in the paint spray booth&#146;s emission control system and ultimately disposed as waste.  The typical transfer efficiency for an electrostatic paint spray systems is 75%.  </P>

<P> In conventional paint spray systems, paint atomization occurs via high velocity air jets forcing paint through small air holes in the paint gun face caps.  Air pressures used in these systems range from 40 to 80 psi, with air volumes of 8 to 30 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm).  The atomized paint particles travel at high velocities and have a greater tendency to bounce off the object being painted, as compared to electrostatic systems.  Transfer efficiencies of 50% are typical for conventional painting systems.</P>

<P> No new wastes are generated when a conventional paint spray system is converted to an electrostatic paint spray system.  Significant reductions in waste generation are achieved due to the electrostatic systems increased transfer efficiency.</P>

<P> A potential drawback to electrostatic finishing, particularly for coating complicated surfaces, is the Faraday cage effect: a tendency for charged coating particles to deposit around entrances of cavities.  The Faraday cage effect allows electric charges on a conductor to reside on the outer surface of the conductor.  In the case of coating complicated surfaces, the electric charge resides on the entrances of cavities.  High particle momentum can help overcome Faraday cage effects, since particles with greater momentum (larger particles or particles traveling at higher speeds) are influenced less by the electrostatic forces.  However, high particle momentum also lowers efficiency. </P>

<P> Electrostatic paint equipment is available in three basic types: air atomized, airless, and rotating discs and bells.  High-speed discs atomize the coating more finely than air atomization and direct more paint to the target.  This technology is particularly efficient for the application of difficult to disperse, high-solids paints.  However, the Faraday cage effect is generally greater with rotary atomizers than with air or airless types.  Rotary atomizers, therefore, may not provide adequate coverage for complicated surfaces.</P>


<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Any material that can be atomized can accept an electrostatic charge, regardless of the coating conductivity.  The workpiece must be groundable.  Metal and some wooden pieces can be painted electrostatically, but plastic, rubber, ceramic, and glass can not.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Electrostatic paint spray systems operate at high voltages (30 to 150 kV).  Hence, operator safety is a major concern.  All items in the work area must be grounded, including the operators, the paint booth, the application equipment (unless applying conductive coatings), and conveyors.  Ungrounded items should be removed from the work area.  Removing paint buildup from the paint booth helps assure that workpieces are grounded.  Workers should never wear rubber- or corked-soled shoes (special shoe-grounding devices are available.).  Adequate skin contact is required when using hand-held guns.  Painters should grasp the gun with bare hands or use gloves with finger tips and palms cut out.</P>


<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Higher transfer efficiencies results in a significant reduction in the generation of waste and reduction in paint usage.</P>

<P><li> Less maintenance is required for pollution control equipment serving the paint booth.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> High capital cost and more spray equipment maintenance is required.</P>

<P><li> The electric charges tend to repel on complicated surfaces.</P>

<P><li> Faraday Cage Effect</P>

<P><li> Surface imperfections are possible due to air molecules becoming trapped in the coating surface.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Cost will vary, depending upon specific applications: painting/coating type, paint volume, workpiece specifications, and technique.  Generally, electrostatic air systems cost approximately $4,000, and electrostatic airless systems cost approximately $6,500.  Installation and training are additional costs.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A High Volume/Low Pressure (HVLP) paint spray system is an efficient technology for the application of paint to specific workpieces.  These systems operate at low pressures which result in the application of paint at low velocities.</P>

<P> HVLP paint systems atomize paint via a high volume of air delivered at a low pressure (less than 10 psi).  In some HVLP systems, the air supply is turbine generated; in others, shop air (100 psi) is reduced to less than 10 psi.  Because the atomized paint particles are delivered at low velocities to the object being painted, less paint is lost as overspray, bounce, and blow back.  Typically the transfer efficiency with HVLP paint system is 50 to 65%.</P>

<P> The effect this technology has on pollution prevention is that the paint delivered at low velocities results in a higher transfer efficiency as compared to conventional paint spray systems.  In conventional spray systems, a stream of liquid paint is met by jets of pressurized air which forms the paint into a fine mist  A typical system employs 100 psi of constant air pressure in a volume of approximately 25 cfm.  The atomized paint particles travel at high velocities and tend to bounce off the object being painted rather than adhering to the surface.  In addition, the expanding high pressure air (above 100 psi) passing through the small face cap openings causes turbulent flow of the paint stream following air currents within the paint booth.  The amount of paint that bypasses the workpiece (overspray) is relatively high for air pressure atomized spray painting.  Transfer efficiencies of 15 to 30% are associated with conventional spray systems.</P>

<P> There are three other types of high transfer efficiency paint guns:  airless (also called pressure atomized), pressure atomized air-assisted, and electrostatic.  Electrostatic paint spray systems are discussed in a separate Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheet, &#147;Electrostatic Paint Spray System&#148; the other two are described below.</P>


<P> Airless spray painting systems atomize paint by forcing it through a small tip orifice at high fluid pressures (1,500 to 3,000 psi).  Transfer efficiencies with airless spray painting are lower than HVLP systems, typically 20 to 40%.  Large areas can be painted quickly by pressure atomized paint systems.  This technology is, however, inappropriate for fine finishing work, because a large quantity of paint is delivered with particles that are less finely divided.</P>

<P> Pressure-atomized, air-assisted systems combine the features of the air atomized (conventional) and airless systems.  An airless fluid spray nozzle is used to atomize the coating into a fan pattern at high pressures (400 to 800 psi).  A second, low-pressure air stream (10 to 30 psi) is injected after the nozzle to improve atomization and the spray pattern.  This system is reported to provide the fine control of air-atomized spray guns and the improved transfer efficiencies of airless systems.  Transfer efficiencies for pressure-atomized, air-assisted systems are lower than HVLP systems, typically 25 to 40%.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> HVLP paint spray systems can be used in a wide variety of painting applications.  The finer atomization of HVLP systems produce smoother surface finishes.  There are many paint gun models, with a variety of tip sizes to accommodate most coatings, including solvent-based paints, water based coatings, fine finish metallic, high-solids polyurethane, contact adhesives, varnish, top coats, lacquer, enamel primer, latex, primer, epoxy, and vinyl fluids.  The efficiency of these systems is reduced if painting is done in exposed areas.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Proper design, separation, and maintenance of the equipment is required for its safe use.  The spray booth must be well ventilated.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should be worn.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Higher transfer efficiencies results in a significant reduction in the generation of waste and a reduction in paint usage.</P>

<P><li> Less maintenance is required for pollution control equipment serving the painting area.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> HVLP systems are sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure and air flow rate.  The operator must monitor these conditions to ensure that proper transfer efficiencies are maintained.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Costs will vary depending upon specific applications, painting/coating type, paint volume, workpiece specifications, and technique.  Generally, HVLP paint spray system equipment costs approximately $1,000 for a gun, hose, and paint pot.  Airless or air-assisted airless paint spray systems range from $2,000 to $3,500.  Installation costs will also vary, depending upon location.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> This data sheet covers the conversion of an existing water curtain spray booths to a dry filter system for the removal of paint based particulates from spray booth air emissions.  </P>

<P> There are many types of dry filter systems, however, all operate on the same principle: particulate-laden air flowing towards the filter media is forced to change directions rapidly.  The particulate, having more inertia than the surrounding air, impacts the filter media and is removed from the air flow.  The scrubbed air is vented into the atmosphere.</P>

<P> Before installing this technology, there are several system issues to be considered in the conversion of a paint spray booth.  These include characteristics and applicability of dry filter systems, required fan size, dry filter surface area, paint booth duty cycles, and paint usage rates.  There are many types of dry filter particulate emissions control systems (PECS) and filters available.</P>

<P> There are four principal types of filters currently used: fiberglass cartridges, multilayer honeycombed paper rolls or pads, accordion-pleated paper sheets, and cloth rolls or pads.  Each type of filter has different characteristics for particulate capacity, removal efficiency, cost, and replacement time.  Filter performance is characterized by three basic parameters: particulate capacity, resistance to air flow, and particulate removal efficiency.  Filter replacement is required when the filter becomes heavily laden with captured particulates, resulting in a reduction in removal efficiency and an increase in the pressure differential across the filter face.</P>

<P> The wastestream generated is a spent filter laden with paint booth particulate emissions.  No other media is contaminated during the collection of the particulate waste, hence the quantity of waste generated is minimized.  The removal, disposal, and replacement of the spent filters is a simple procedure. </P>

<P> The existing technology employs a water curtain to remove particulate emissions.  The primary disadvantage of this technology is the generation of large quantities of wastewater and paint sludge.  The wastewater typically requires off-site treatment and the paint sludge is frequently disposed as a hazardous waste. </P>

<P> When using lead or zinc chromate paints, the dry filter will eliminate approximately 50 to 90% of the hazardous waste that is generated by a water curtain spray paint booth.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Powder paint is typically not used in dry filter paint booths because this type of paint is usually recycled, which is not economical using a dry filter paint booth.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> The concerns with the dry filter systems are with the variety of paints that are used and the potential contaminant exposure.  When using lead and zinc chromate paints, inhalation of lead or zinc can irritate the respiratory tract and can be poisonous.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should be used.  These safety and health issues are also a concern with water curtain spray booths.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>

<p><li> Decreased operating costs when compared to water curtain spray booths:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Eliminates chemical costs</P>

<P><li> Reduces electrical costs</P>

<P><li> Eliminates water costs and potential sewer disposal costs</P>
</ul>
<P><li> Reduces waste generation by eliminating wastewater and paint sludge wastes </P>

<P><li> Eliminates need for daily skimming and removal of sludge from the booth</P>

<P><li> Increased particulate removal efficiency</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Not compatible with powder paint applications</P>

<P><li> Filter selection is dependent on paint type and application</P>

<P><li> Frequent downtime periods are likely due to improper filter selection.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Converting a water curtain spray booth to a dry filter paint booth can be easily accomplished and can be done in-house.  The cost of conversion usually ranges from $200 to $2,000, depending on the size and condition of the old water curtain spray booth.  Purchasing a new dry filter paint booth can cost between $2,000 and $20,000.  The conversion from a water curtain spray booth to a dry filter paint booth can save several thousand dollars in operating and maintenance costs per year.</P>

<P><B>Revision:</B> 1/96</P>

<P><B>Process Code:</B> Navy: N/A; Air Force: N/A; Army: N/A</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: Medium; Army: Medium; Air Force: High</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B>  N/A</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>Halon 1211 (Bromochlorodifluoromethane) (CAS:  353-59-3), Halon 1301 (Bromotrifluoromethane) (CAS: 75-63-8)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Halon 1211 and 1301 are widely-used fire-suppression and explosion-protection agents. However, both Halon 1211 and Halon 1301 have extremely high ozone-depletion potentials; therefore, production has been halted and use is being curtailed until existing supplies are exhausted.</P>

<P> Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 are still approved for use, but only in mission-critical applications such as flight-line fire fighting and ship- and shore-based crash and rescue operations.  In addition, each mission-critical application requires a waiver for procurement of replacement Halon, and its procurement must come from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Halon reserve, since purchase of new product is now impossible. Furthermore, any existing non-mission-critical applications must be decommissioned and allocated to the DLA Halon reserve&#146;s stockpile. Conservation of Halons is necessary to preserve existing supplies until replacement products and systems can be implemented.  Actual use should be restricted to real incidents requiring fire suppression.  Routine testing of systems for proper operation with the Halon product is discouraged.</P>

<P> However, the price of reclaimed Halon should start to drop as &#147;approved&#148; alternatives become available and large companies satisfy their Halon needs. Surplus Halon is likely to be resold, since Halon cannot be destroyed economically. Thus, redistribution, recovery, recycling, and reclamation are all methods of meeting future Halon demand. Recycling is the process of removing contaminants (oils, nitrogen, particulates, moisture) by refrigeration and filtration so that the Halon can again be used in a fire suppression system. Reclaiming involves reprocessing the Halon to new product specifications through filtration, distillation, refrigeration, and vaporization.</P>

<P>Halon Redistribution: Both E/M Corporation, a subsidiary of Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, and Automatic Suppression Systems of South Holland, Illinois, provide a recycling service to restore contaminated Halon back to Mil-Spec quality, as well as a market for Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 resale to distributors. The steps required to recover Halon include the following:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Verify that cylinders contain Halon 1301, Halon 1211, or other Halons.</P>

<P><li> Transfer Halon to blow-down tank for storage.</P>

<P><li> Recycle Halon through a recycling system to remove contaminants or reclaim the Halon so that it meets all necessary specifications.</P>

<P><li> Verify that the reclaimed Halon meets the necessary specifications.</P>

<P><li> Return Halon to storage cylinders.</P>
</ol>

<P> In order to recycle Halon, certain components are required. The pumping system must be able to quickly and efficiently (99 percent efficiency to prevent the escape of Halon into the atmosphere) move the Halon liquid and vapor from the storage tank to processing equipment. Operating pressures range from 360 to 600 psig for pressurized cylinders down to a vacuum of 10 to 20 inches of mercury for cylinders which will be opened to the atmosphere. The recycling system should include modules for 1) removing contaminants by filtration and 2) removing nitrogen by condensing the Halon and venting the nitrogen. Filters should be replaceable without the release of Halon. In general, the two modules can run automatically and are not labor intensive.</P>

<P>Typically, limited Halon supplies are restricted to the following critical use applications. These criteria are only suggested guidelines and do not represent EPA legislation:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Where a potential for fatalities or serious injuries exists.</P>

<P><li> Where hazardous material processes could result in an environmental release with potential for fatalities, serious injuries, serious environmental incident, adverse public opinion, or fire/explosion.</P>

<P><li> Where damage will exceed $50 million.</P>

<P><li> When severe economic impact will result due to interruption of sales.</P>
</ul>

<P>For more detailed information on Halon 1211 and 1301 alternatives, see the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheets, &#147;Halon 1211: Uses, Restrictions and Replacements,&#148; and, &#147;Halon 1301: Uses, Restrictions and Replacements.&#148;</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Halons are very inert and not deleterious to most elastomers, metals, or electronic systems. Halons do decompose to a small degree during a fire extinguishing event, releasing some hydrofluoric acid gases. However, the concentrations are so small (several hundred to several thousand ppm) and the gases so readily dispersed that material compatibility is not normally a concern, even if materials left in the enclosed space are sensitive to the acid gases/decomposition products of Halons. Damage is more often caused by the smoke, ash, and soot of the fire.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Both dry chemical and perfluorocarbons have low order toxicities.  However, care should be taken when handling any of these chemicals. Proper personal protective equipment is always recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Production of both Halon 1301 and Halon 1211 has been stopped, and any existing material will most likely be used for its originally intended purpose. Currently, there is no good method of converting Halon 1301 or Halon 1211 into other compounds or destroying them.   Careful use of the material for mission-critical applications will conserve current supplies and prolong the time over which the material enters the environment, thus lessening the immediate impact on the ozone layer.</P>

<P>Because there is no universal drop-in replacement, and many of the approved substitutes also have undesirable characteristics like high global warming potentials, careful consideration is necessary in order to select the optimum alternative and achieve the maximum benefit.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> An ODS-free and EPA 17 chemical-free carburetor cleaner called 2005 Gum-Solve Liquid Carburetor Cleaner is available as a substitute for Clear R Carb cleaner, which contains ODSs as well as toluene and xylene.  Carburetor cleaners have typically been formulated using solvents that were very effective in dissolving gums and varnish buildups typically found in carburetors after long use.  These solvents are either ODSs or EPA 17 listed, and as a result are no longer considered acceptable for open use such as carburetor cleaners.  Several alternative cleaners are now available, including PENRAY's ODS-free and EPA 17-free 2005 Gum-Solve Liquid Carburetor Cleaner.  Also available under NSNs 6850-01-085-1423 and 2940-00-123-7195 are ODS-free carburetor cleaners that have small percentages of toluene and/or xylenes.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Software has been developed to track ozone-depleting substance (ODS) inventories, servicing dates, quantities, refrigerant types, system capacities, leak frequencies, and component failures. There are several programs available.</P>

<P> The Army Corps of Engineers has developed a two-level program to manage refrigerants; it is called Refrigerant Management System (RMS). RMS is designed to keep track of the addition and removal of refrigerants and refrigerant services performed on each piece of Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (AC&amp;R) equipment. The Personal Computer (PC) based software consists of two modules, level 1 and level 2. Level 1 is for AC&amp;R technicians/operators to keep records of refrigerant services performed on AC&amp;R equipment. Level 2 is a database of refrigerant transactions (additions or subtractions); it is an inventory of AC&amp;R equipment and a database of refrigerant services performed on AC&amp;R equipment. RMS prepares transaction reports summarizing refrigerant services performed; output is in ASCII text format. RMS is available on floppy disks from the US Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USACERL) in Champaign, Illinois.  At present, there is no charge for the software.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>The software should improve equipment leak integrity and reduce refrigerant use by providing a more complete maintenance history, identifying problem areas, and reducing variations between scheduled maintenance. This should reduce the number and frequency of major equipment failures and the large losses of refrigerant associated with failures on a large scale.  It should also allow forecasting of requirements so that more accurate quantities of Class I ODSs can be procured from the Defense Logistics Agency.  In addition, reclamation and recycling can be better coordinated with routine maintenance needs so that DOD policy to reduce ODS consumption becomes a built-in function.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Numerous refrigerant recovery systems are now on the market to enable recovery of refrigerants and thus avoid the former common practice of refrigerant venting during routine servicing.  In fact, CFC-12 recovery is required by law, and HFC-134a recovery will be mandatory as of 15 Nov 95.</P>

<P> A number of different companies manufacture refrigerant recovery systems for CFC-12 and HFC-134a (also known as R-12 and R-134a).  Models vary in cost, capability, ease of use, and efficiency.  In every case, each model is certified for the recovery of a specific refrigerant.  Mixing of refrigerants affects their chemical properties, affecting not only their potential reuse but also the capacity and ability of the equipment recovering them.  Therefore, every recovery system should be dedicated to reclamation of the refrigerant it was designed to recover.</P>

<P> R-134a can be ordered by the following NSNs:</p>

<p> 6830-01-370-6207 45 lb container
<BR> 6830-01-370-6208 45 lb container

<P><B>Process Code:</B> Navy: ID-04-99; Air Force: MT03; Army: N/A</P> 

<p><b>Usage List:</b> Navy: Low; Army: Medium; Air Force: Medium</p> 

<P><B>Opportunity:</B> Reduction of the hazardous waste volume generated and the associated disposal costs</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Sulfuric Acid (CAS: 7664-93-9),  Aluminum (CAS:  7429-90-5)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Electrodialysis is a process that will efficiently maintain a low metal ion concentration in the anodizing bath solution by transporting metal ions from the bath solution through a selective membrane into a capture media using an electrical current to induce flow.</P>

<P>When anodizing aluminum, for example, the bath solution is required to be changed out and disposed of when the aluminum concentration reaches 80-100 grams/liter.  The spent solution contains high levels of sulfuric acid and aluminum, requiring neutralization and metals removal for a typically large volume prior to disposal.</P>

<P>Electrodialysis does not affect the anodizing process.  It is simply a process that can indefinitely extend the useful life of the bath solution by maintaining a low concentration of metal ions.  The capture media, catholyte, is not immune to the presence of the metal ions and forms a concentrated sludge.  The sludge must be removed from the unit and the catholyte changed out on a regular basis to ensure effective metals removal from the anodizing bath solution.  The recovered sludge is a hazardous waste containing high concentrations of metal that can be reclaimed by an outside company.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Spent sulfuric acid waste can be extremely corrosive to skin tissue. Contact with the body can result in severe burns. Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
</P>
<ul><li> Reduction of hazardous waste volume and the associated disposal costs.</P>

<P><li> Metals reclamation and reduction of liability if sludge is recovered by an outside company.</P>

<P><li> Indefinite extension of anodizing bath solutions useful life.</P>

<P><li> Lower annual cost for chemical makeup &amp; replacement.</P>

<P><li> Improved production quality and consistent reproducibility of manufactured parts due to control of the metal ion concentration in the anodizing bath solution.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3></P>
<ul><li>Moderately high capital cost.</P>

<P><li> Increase in the number of possible exposures with regard to the handling of hazardous waste.</P>

<P><li> Ability to locate company that will recover and reclaim metals from the sludge.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p>The addition of an electrodialysis unit to an anodizing bath system can significantly reduce the volume of hazardous waste generated and the associated disposal costs.  Variables affecting the capital cost, operation &amp; maintenance costs, and the hazardous waste disposal costs with regard to the addition of an electrodialysis unit include:</P>
<ul>

<P>- The frequency of pre-change bath solution replacement</P>

<P>- Cost to heat the bath solution after replacement</P>

<P>- The metal ion loading rate for the bath solution</P>

<P>- The metal ion removal rate of the electrodialysis unit</P>

<P>- Ability to locate an outside company to recover the generated sludge.</P>

<P><li> Assumptions</P>
<ul>
<P>- Volume of anodizing bath solution,  5000 gal.</P>

<P>- Volume of electrodialysis unit,  55 gal.</P>

<P>- Labor costs are equal for both methods</P>

<P>- Anodized bath solution requires 10% vol. sulfuric acid, $200, and 10 oz/gal chromic acid, $1500, per changeout</P>

<P>- Anodizing bath solution replaced once a year</P>

<P>- Anodizing bath make-up solution volumes and costs are negligible</P>

<P>- Electrodialysis solution, catholyte, is $50 per 55 gal make-up.</P>

<P>- Catholyte replacement during the first six months of operation shall be weekly, thereafter, on a bi-weekly basis</P>

<P>- Annual energy costs for the electrodialysis unit:</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> ODSs have seen use in many different applications, including that of cooling agents.  However, this direct application of CFCs does not lend itself to CFC recovery, and given the imminent production ban, alternatives need to be substituted.</P>

<P> In compressed gas form, CFCs are effective cooling agents; for example, for heat sensitive electronics or for testing anti-icing instruments like the probe on F-16 aircraft engine intakes.  When the pressurized CFC is directed at the component or point of desired cooling and let down to atmospheric pressure, a cooling effect takes place due to the isoenthalpic expansion of the compressed gas.  Recovery of the spent gas is difficult; therefore, alternatives must increasingly be substituted.</P>

<P> Various ODS-free products have been developed by several manufacturers for cooling applications, such as heat sensitive avionics, electrical, and computer components.</P>

<p><b>Usage List:</b> Navy: Low; Army: Medium; Air Force: High</p>

<P><B>Substitute for: </B>Hard Chrome Plating</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituent: </B>Chromic Acid (CAS: 7738-94-5), Sulfuric Acid (CAS:  7664-93-9), Lead (CAS:  7439-92-1), Chromium (CAS:  7440-47-3), Nickel (CAS:  7440-02-0), and Copper (CAS:  7440-50-8)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview: </H3>

<p>High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray technology is a dry process that produces a dense metallic coating whose desired physical properties are equal to or surpass those of hard chrome plating (HCP). These properties include wear resistance, corrosion resistance, low oxide content, low stress, low porosity, and high bonding strength to the base metal.</P>

<P>HVOF thermal spray uses a fuel (i.e., propylene, hydrogen, kerosene)/oxygen mixture in a combustion chamber. This combustion process melts a metal containing powder that is continually fed into a gun using a carrier gas (argon) and propels it at high speeds (3,000 - 4,000 ft/sec) towards the surface of the part to be coated. The high speeds of the spray coating produce a coating that can be used as an alternative to the HCP process. The metal powder is available in many compositions, including nickel, nichrome, inconel, chrome carbide, and tungsten carbide. Uniform coating thickness&#146; of up to 0.250 inches can be achieved.</P>

<P> The only waste stream produced by HVOF is from the capture of the overspray. Current users either use a water curtain filter system or a dry high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Since the overspray contains only the pure metal or alloy, it is feasible to recycle or reclaim this waste stream.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> When working with fine particulate matter that consists of various compositions of different metals, inhalation is a primary concern. Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits: </H3>
<ul>

<P><li> Surface coating physical properties are at least equal to those of HCP</P>

<P><li> Multiple choice of coating materials</P>

<P><li> Large volume reduction of hazardous waste and the associated disposal costs</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>

<P><li> Line-of-sight process, can only coat the external surface of a part not  the inner diameters</P>

<P><li> High capital cost</P>

<P><li> Process must be housed in a full enclosure of sufficient size to process parts that normally utilize HCP</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The cost for implementing HVOF in lieu of continuing to use HCP to apply a surface coating to production parts depends on many variables, in particular the following:</P>
<ul>

<P>- Quantity of work to be transferred from HCP</P>

<P>- Whether a robotic or manual system is used</P>

<P>- Type of capture system used</P>

<P>- Availability of space at the facility to house the HVOF enclosure</P>

<P>To better define these variables and some of the costs, the implementation of HVOF technology at an existing DOD facility (Air Logistic Center) as a replacement for 20% of the then current HCP production will be examined.   </P>

<P>- Total number of HCP tanks at facility, 8</P>

<P>- Current disposal treatment for HCP waste streams is pretreatment at the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP), unless the facility has a zero discharge rinse water recycling system installed, prior to release to the Public Owned Treatment Works (POTW)</P>

<P>- 20% of HCP production to be transferred to HVOF with an additional 15% planned in the future</P>

<P>- Manual system to be implemented, High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter selected for overspray capture system, space is available to house the HVOF process</P>

<P>- Capital Cost plus Installation of HVOF equipment, $100,000 - 120,000</P>

<P>- Capital Cost of HEPA filter System, approx. $50,000</P>

<P>- Fuel mixture is Oxygen/hydrogen</P>

<P>- Metal powder for coating shall be Tungsten or Chromium Carbide, $40-65 per pound</P>

<P>- No additional labor resources are required as the displaced workers will be trained for HVOF</P>

<P>- Training provided by the manufacturer of the HVOF equipment</P>

<P>- No disposal costs for overspray, recovered metals are sold to a local refiner</P>

<P>- Finished product cost is dependent on the number of parts processed and the computed cost for consumables and labor per mil&#215;ft<SUP>2</SUP> of coating (1 mil = 0.001 inches)</P>

<P>- Toxic air emissions from HCP bath containers reduced</P>

<P>- More than 90% volume reduction of rinse water that would have been generated using HCP for allocated work</P>

<P>- Annual savings will increase, while the payback period, air emissions, hazardous waste generation, and the associated disposal costs will continue to be reduced as more work is transferred to HVOF</P>

<P>- Estimated Payback Period:  1.5 years</P>

<P>- Estimated Annual Savings after Payback Period:  $70,000 at 20% production transfer to HVOF;  $200,000 at 35% production transfer to HVOF</P>
</ul>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<P><B>Usage List:</B> Navy: High; Army: High; Air Force: High</P>

<P><B>Substitute for:</B> Certain electroplating processes like cadmium plating</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>N/A</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) comprises a group of surface coating technologies used for decorative coating, tool coating, and other equipment coating applications.  It is fundamentally an evaporative coating  process in which the basic mechanism is an atom by atom transfer of material from the solid phase to the vapor phase and back to the solid phase, gradually building a film on the surface to be coated.</P>

<P>There are three basic process categories considered as PVD technologies:  ion plating, evaporation, and sputtering.  All of which utilize the same three fundamental steps to develop a coating.  Each of the PVD technologies generate and deposit material in a somewhat different manner, requiring equipment unique to each process.  The three fundamental steps include:</P>

<P>1. Vapor phase generation from coating material stock by -</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Evaporation</P>

<P><li> Sputtering</P>

<P><li> Chemical vapors and gases</P>
</ul>

<P>2. The transfer of the vapor phase from source to substrate by -</P>
<ul>

<P><li> Line-of-sight</P>

<P><li> Molecular flow</P>

<P><li> High partial pressure of coating material</P>

<P><li> Vapor ionization by creating a plasma</P>
</ul>

<P>3. Deposition and film growth on the substrate</P>


<P>These steps can be independent or superimposed on each other depending on the desired coating  characteristics.  The final result of the coating/substrate composite is a function of each materials individual properties, the interaction of the materials and any process constraints that may exist.</P>


<P>The selection criteria for determining the best method of PVD is dependent on several factors;</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Material to be deposited</P>

<P><li> Rate of deposition</P>

<P><li> Limitations imposed by the substrate, such as, the maximum deposition temperature</P>

<P><li> Adhesion of the deposition to the substrate</P>

<P><li> Throwing power (rate and thickness distribution of the deposition process, i.e., the higher the throwing power, the better the process ability to coat irregularly-shaped objects with uniform thickness)</P>

<P><li> Purity of coating materials</P>

<P><li> Equipment requirements and their availability</P>

<P><li> Cost</P>

<P><li> Ecological considerations</P>

<P><li> Abundance of deposition material</P>
</ol>

<P>PVD is a desirable alternative to electroplating and possibly some painting applications.  PVD can be applied using a wide variety of materials to coat an equally diverse number of substrates using any three of the basic PVD technologies to deposit a number of desired finishes of variable thickness with specific characteristics.</P>

<P>The application of PVD surface coating technologies at large scale, high volume operations will result in the reduction of hazardous waste generated when compared to electroplating and other metal finishing processes that use large quantities of toxic and hazardous materials at major maintenance facilities.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> PVD coating processes are compatible with most metals and some plastics either as coatings or as substrates. However, temperature constraints may limit the degree to which dense coatings can be deposited on some plastics. Finally, PVD processes do not normally produce the kind of coatings that work well where lubrication is required. Thus, PVD coatings are not usually good choices for parts such as fasteners.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The safety and health issues must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits: </H3>
<ul>
<P><li> The coatings are typically harder and more corrosion resistant than coatings applied by the electroplating process.  Most coatings have high temperature and good impact strength, excellent abrasion resistance and are so durable that protective topcoats are almost never necessary.</P>

<P><li> Ability to utilize virtually any type of inorganic and some organic coating materials on an equally diverse group of substrates and surfaces using a wide variety of finishes.</P>

<P><li> More environmentally friendly than traditional coating process like electroplating and painting.</P>

<P><li> More than one technique can be used to deposit a given film.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Specific technologies can impose constraints; for example, line-of-sight transfer makes coating annular shapes practically impossible.</P>

<P><li> PVD technologies operate at very high temperatures and vacuums, requiring special attention by operating personnel.</P>

<P><li> Requires a cooling water system to dissipate large heat loads.</P>

<P><li> Selection of the best PVD technology may require some experience and/or experimentation.</P>

<P><li> High capital costs</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Economic considerations are probably the primary hindrance to conversion of more plating operations to any of the vapor deposition processes. A capital cost of several hundred thousand dollars is the order of magnitude for a new vapor deposition installation. Operating costs are, however, roughly equal to electroplating, although plating can be slightly less labor intensive.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Sand filters can be used for storm water quality control and managing storm water runoff volumes. Sand filters are composed of at least two components: a sedimentation chamber and a filtration chamber. The sedimentation chamber removes floatables and heavy sediments, while the filtration chamber removes additional pollutants by filtering flow through a sand bed. Treated filtrate is normally diverted back to the storm drainage system via an underdrain system or pipe network. Pollutants such as suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and fecal coliform bacteria are effectively removed from storm water flows when treated by a sand filter system. Other pollutants removed include nitrogen, phosphorus, and some metals.  Sand filter designs include the surface sand filter basin (AKA Austin Sand filter), the underground vault sand filter (Washington, DC sand filter), the double trench sand filter (Delaware sand filter), the stone reservoir trench sand filter, and the peat sand filter system.  Modifications are often made to these designs based on site-specific conditions.</P>

<P> Sand filters provide a highly effective means of removing pollutants from storm water while remaining flexible in application to allow for modifications in basic design structure to accommodate site-specific criteria. Modifications to the basic structure arise due to site differences, including drainage area served, filter surface areas, land requirements, and quantity of runoff treated. Sand filters are currently popular best management practices (BMPs) used in Delaware; Florida; Austin, Texas; Alexandria, Virginia; and Washington, DC</P>

<P> The Austin sand filter was designed to detain runoff in a sedimentation chamber where heavy sediments and floatables are removed.  Estimates of pollutant removal efficiencies for various Austin sand filters, based on the preliminary findings of the city&#146;s storm water monitoring program, are as follows:</P>

<P> 76 % Fecal Coliform</P>

<P> 70 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS)</P>

<P> 70 % Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)</P>

<P> 48 % Total Organic Carbon (TOC)</P>

<P> 46 % Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN)</P>

<P> 45 % Iron (Fe)</P>

<P> 45 % Lead (Pb)</P>

<P> 45 % Zinc (Zn)</P>

<P> 33 % Total Phosphorous (TP)</P>

<P> 21 % Total Nitrogen</P>

<P>  0 % Nitrate as Nitrogen (NO<SUB>3</SUB>--N)</P>

<P> The percentages listed include partial and full sedimentation systems with different drainage areas. Current monitoring data from the Austin sand filters indicates phosphorous removal efficiencies of up to 60 percent. The Austin sand filter has been used in Alexandria, Virginia; monitoring of these units indicated a phosphorus removal of up to 40 percent. Nitrate was not removed nor is it known what the removal efficiencies are for other dissolved pollutants.</P>

<P> The underground vault (Washington, DC) sand filter is designed for use in highly urbanized areas, and can be placed underneath parking lots, alleys, and driveways. The sand filter works best when treating the first 0.5 inch of runoff from an impervious drainage area of less than 1 acre. Sediments and floatables such as oil, grease, and leaves are effectively removed from runoff, which is diverted through a submerged weir connecting the sedimentation chamber and the filtration chamber. Trash collected by the weir must be cleaned out every 6 months for proper functioning.</P>

<P> The double trench (Delaware) sand filter is designed for drainage areas of less than 5 acres. It has been determined that this design results in 80 percent removal of suspended solids.</P>

<P> The stone reservoir trench system incorporates concepts of the Austin and the District of Columbia sand filters, but adapts the design to small and less complex applications where infiltration trenches, an alternate BMP, would be impracticable.</P>


<P> The Austin sand filter can be modified to use peat within the filtration process. Modifications include a 12- to 18-inch thick surface layer of hemic or fibric peat, underlain by a layer of calcitic limestone, and finally underlain by a 4 inch well-mixed layer of half sand and half peat, all of which sits atop the normal sand filter. Addition of peat to the filtration chamber appears to increase microbial growth within the sand filter and improve pollutant removal rates.</P>

<P>Performance of sand filters may be sustained through frequent inspections and replacement of the filter fabric and media every 3 to 5 years, depending on the pollutant load being treated. Accumulated trash and debris should be removed from the sand filters every 6 months or as necessary. Performance can also be increased by stabilizing the drainage area to minimize sediment loading, ensuring that the sedimentation chamber adequately removes suspended solids sediments prior to the filtration chamber and allowing for adequate detention times for both sedimentation and filtration.</P>


<P> The design of sand filters with impermeable chambers that prevent groundwater infiltration are preferred in situations where groundwater contamination is a concern. The Austin; Delaware; and Washington, DC, sand filters may substitute for water quality inlets when hydrocarbons are of concern. Due to the size of the Austin sand filter, it can also be used instead of wet ponds for treatment of contaminated runoff in areas where evaporation exceeds rainfall.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Safety and health concerns are dependent on the types of contaminants in the storm water. Metals and phosphorus, for instance, require caution in handling. They are skin irritants. Protection should be worn when handling contaminants like fecal coliform. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>Sand filters, in particular those mentioned previously, achieve high removal efficiencies for suspended solids, BOD, and fecal coliform bacteria. Hydrocarbons and nutrients are also removed by sand filters. Sand filters designed with impermeable basins limit the potential for groundwater contamination while treating storm water.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Nitrates are not removed </P>

<P><li> Ineffective at removal of dissolved pollutants</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Construction costs vary depending on the sand filter system being designed. The Austin sand filtration system costs approximately $18,500 for treatment of a 1-acre drainage area. In this instance, the cost decreases with increasing drainage area. The precast cost for a 1 acre drainage area for a Washington, DC, sand filter range from $6,600 to $11,000. Similar costs exist for the Delaware sand filter.</P>

<P> Maintenance costs for a sand filter average 5 percent of the construction cost. Material costs for the gravel layer, filter fabric, and top portion of sand for the Washington, D.C., sand filter amounted to approximately $1,700.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The refrigerants used in drinking fountains to chill the water are typically CFCs.  However, there are several companies that have developed CFC-free refrigeration units for their drinking fountains.  At least two companies offer CFC-free refrigeration units as part of their drinking fountain products.  Both use a non-ozone depleting chemical called HFC-134a (also known as R-134a), which is a hydrofluorocarbon. While R-134a is a non-ozone depleting refrigerant, it is, also a greenhouse gas and has a global warming potential.  Thus, these units must be serviced by certified refrigeration technicians and are subject to the &#147;non-venting rule&#148; for Class I and Class II ODS replacements per the Clean Air Act Amendments as stated in 58 FR 92, Section 608(c)(2) page 28,664, scheduled to take effect as of 15 Nov 95.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Water quality inlets (WQIs) are structures designed to separate pollutants from the first flush of storm water using a series of chambers for pollutant sedimentation, screening, and separation. A water quality inlet typically consists of a sedimentation chamber, an oil separation chamber, and a discharge chamber. Because of their separation capabilities, WQIs are occasionally referred to as oil/grit separators or oil/water separators. These best management practices (BMPs) may be constructed on site, precast, or manufactured by a vendor.</P>

<P> Water quality inlets are widely used in the US for improving storm water runoff quality where space is limited and funding prohibits the use of larger BMPs, such as ponds or wetlands. Water quality inlets are able to effectively separate hydrocarbons from storm water runoff. During the first 5 years of use, over 95% of all WQIs were in operation as designed. WQIs do not manage the volume of storm water flow, due to limited capacity, and have limited removal efficiencies when not properly maintained. For these reasons, WQIs are often used to pretreat runoff prior to discharge to other BMPs.</P>

<P> The WQI should be located within close proximity to a storm drain network to allow for future discharge from the WQI to the sewer system. WQIs are typically used as an off-line treatment process where lower flows will be encountered; high flows result in resuspension of settled material. Construction activity should be complete and the drainage area stabilized to minimize sediment loading to a WQI. The WQI should be located in a small, impervious area and be watertight.</P>

<P> Storm water runoff enters the sedimentation chamber in a water quality inlet where coarse materials settle. Flow from the sedimentation chamber is conveyed to the second chamber through an orifice covered with a trash rack and located halfway down the wall separating the two chambers. The second chamber functions as an oil separation chamber.  Water that enters the third sequential chamber discharges through a storm water outlet pipe. The design should include permanent pools within the chambers, to reduce sediment resuspension during storm events, and manholes located above the chambers, to provide access for cleaning and inspection.</P>

<P> The limited capacity of most WQIs typically means that the discharge rate is high and the detention time is relatively short. Most water quality inlets have an average detention time of less than a half hour. Efficient pollutant removal is dependent upon proper maintenance; the lack thereof may result in resuspension and discharge of settled pollutants and separated oil. The required maintenance will vary from site to site, but cleaning before the start of each season and inspection after every storm event should ensure proper functioning of the WQI.</P>

<P> Water quality inlets generally have minimal effect on the removal of nutrients, metals, and organic pollutants other than free petroleum products. The sedimentation chamber can be expected to partially reduce grit and sediments.  Separation of dissolved or emulsified oil from water is rarely achieved, although WQIs are effective in separating free oil and grease from storm water.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The safety and health issues are dependent on the types of contaminants in the storm water. Carbon can be a minor irritant to mucous membranes and eyes. Handling hydrocarbons requires caution. proper personal protection equipment is recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>WQIs are useful for separating sediments and oil from storm water runoff. If properly maintained, these pollutants are removed from the WQI, and the quality of the downstream storm water is improved.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> WQIs do not manage the volume of storm water </P>

<P> <li>  Limited removal efficiencies when not properly maintained</P>

<P> <li>  WQI residuals may require disposal as a hazardous waste.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Cast-in-place WQIs may range in cost from $5,200 to $16,700. The cost for a precast WQI is generally lower than for other manufactured units.  Practical and acceptable maintenance procedures for clean out and disposal of residuals have not been adequately determined for the WQIs currently in operation. Major costs would be the removal, analysis, and disposal of the residuals.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Halon recycling units are available to help extend the life of Halon 1301 where it is used as a fire-suppression and explosion-protection agent.  Halon 1301 is still approved for use <B>only</B> in mission-critical applications.  Mission-critical applications include flight-line fire fighting, and ship- and shore-based crash and rescue operations.  Each application requires a waiver for procurement of Halon 1301 replacement.  Procurement must come from the Defense Logistics Agency&#146;s (DLA) halon reserve (Defense Supply Center, Richmond, Virginia), since production was banned in January 1996.  Conservation of halons is necessary to preserve existing supplies until replacement products and systems can be implemented.</P>

<P> Halon 1301 recycling systems remove contaminants by filtration and condensation to meet required product specifications.  The basic recycling system includes a pumping system that efficiently transfers the halon from the storage tank into the processing equipment, and modules for filtration and condensation.  The recycling process first recovers halon at 99% efficiency with the use of the pump and filtration units.  The pump operates on 100-120 psi of compressed air at 13 cubic feet per minute, and has an average of 16 pounds per minute of liquid transfer rate and 2 pounds per minute of vapor transfer rate.  The filtration unit operates at 120 volts, 4-amp circuit, and removes contaminants accumulated during transfer or fill operation, or when a cylinder or storage vessel rusts and degrades.  Molecular sieve filters are used in the unit to remove particulate matter, moisture, oil, water, wax, and sludge.  The filtration unit also has a salt crystal indicator that shows the presence of moisture.  The condensing unit requires the use of liquid nitrogen and operates at 120 volts and 4 amps.  Nitrogen in the halon is separated via condensation, and is then vented to the atmosphere.  The recycling rate for this technology is 99%.  Consult the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard, ASTM D5631-94, to determine proper procedures for handling, transportation, and storage of Halon 1301.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Halons are very inert and are not harmful to most elastomers, metals, or electronic systems.  Halon decomposition during a fire-extinguishing event can result in the release of hydrofluoric acid gas, but the concentrations are small and readily disperse.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Halon 1301 is a nonflammable, non-corrosive gas and is normally stored and shipped as a liquefied compressed gas.  Precautions when handling, storing, and transporting of storage cylinders must be observed.  Only trained and authorized personnel should handle the halon storage tanks and recycling system.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Extends the useful life of the Halon 1301 supply</P>

<P><li> Reduces activity down time associated with the Halon 1301 replacement procurement process</P>

<P><li> Extends the time period over which the material enters the environment</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Requires operator training</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Halon 1301 can be procured at no cost to mission-critical applications from DLA Defense Supply Center located at Richmond, Virginia.  However, Halon 1301 recycling systems can be used to extend the useful life of existing Halon 1301 supply at a minimal cost.  Naval Air Station, North Island is currently operating a Halon 1301 recycling system.  This system is comprised of pumping, filtration, and nitrogen separation units that remove contaminants and recycle the halon to ASTM and Mil-Spec levels.  The cost elements for operating a Halon 1301 recycling system are provided below.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p>Refrigerants can be conserved in several ways including recovery, recycling, and reclaiming. Each process requires specialized equipment certified by the EPA. As CFCs are phased out of production, recovery, recycling, and reclaiming will become the primary source of CFCs for use in existing systems.</P>

<P>Recovery and Reuse: Recovery is the process of removing a refrigerant from the system, storing it in a cylinder, and returning it to the system after all repairs have been made. While cleaning the refrigerant may be a good idea, the refrigerant can often be returned to the system without being tested or processed in any way. If the refrigerant is removed from the job site, it must meet the criteria of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute (ARI) Standard 700-93, a system of monitoring the maximum contaminant levels and physical properties of the refrigerant.</P>

<P> Refrigerant should always be placed in a properly-marked cylinder that has been evacuated to reduce contamination (primarily air and moisture). The quality of the refrigerant can be tested using any number of refrigerant test kits on the market. By using recovered refrigerant, several assumptions are made: 1) The refrigerant is in good condition, 2) The refrigerant meets all EPA standards, 3) Minimal refrigerant has been lost, and 4) The recovered refrigerant will meet the requirements of the original equipment manufacturer.</P>

<P>Recycling: Recycling is the process of cleaning the refrigerant by oil separation and filtration before it is returned to the system. Recycling is best suited for small amounts of refrigerants like those contained in most motor vehicle air-conditioning and home air-conditioning systems. The refrigerant is returned to the system in better condition than a simple recovery or re-use operation.</P>

<P>Off-Site Reclaiming: Used in case of extreme contamination, off-site reclamation is the process of refining a refrigerant so that it meets or exceeds specifications. The refrigerant must meet ARI 700-93 standards. Many reclaiming facilities will provide clients with the equipment necessary for recovering and transporting the refrigerant. Advantages are many: the facility takes full responsibility for the refrigerant quality, no taxes apply to reclaimed refrigerants, and the refrigerant is available for use in the future in a &#147;like new&#148; condition.</P>

<P><B>Recovery/Reclamation Specifications</B></P>

<P> The EPA has approved equipment to capture and recycle refrigerants from air conditioning systems during repair or decommissioning. Section 609 of the Clean Air Act Amendments, &#147;Approved Refrigerant Recycling Equipment,&#148; 23Aug94, lists approved systems and manufacturers of refrigerant recycling equipment.  Also, the Underwriters Laboratories has a directory of certified equipment, &#147;Certified Commercial Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment Directory,&#148; 21Mar93.</P>

<P>Recovery Methods: To expedite the process, recover the refrigerant liquid first, then recover the vapor. Some equipment is vulnerable to compressor damage as a result of improper removal of the refrigerant. Check with the original equipment manufacturer for proper evacuation procedures. For large systems such as chillers and industrial units, a liquid refrigeration pump is used for removing the refrigerant. All recovery and recycling equipment must meet ARI Standard 740.</P>

<P> Most refrigerant recovery equipment has epoxy-lined steel ASME-rated tanks and electrically-powered vacuum pumps, compressors, and fan-cooled condensers.  Many recovery units are capable of processing a number of the most commonly used refrigerants without changes in equipment settings or operational procedures between batches (note: refrigerants cannot be mixed).  The machine should be cleaned between batches if dirty, but no other special changes are necessary.  The units achieve recovery by high vacuum (~27 in. Hg vacuum), recycling by filtration, and reclamation by distillation at processing capacities of 4 to 7 lb/min.  Trailers are available for transporting the machines.</P>

<P>Recycling Methods: If the quality of the refrigerant is in question, recycle the recovered refrigerant so that it meets ARI Standard 700-93 with respect to moisture, acids, boiling-point residues, and other contaminants. Follow the listed steps to recharge the system after recycling the refrigerant:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Install new liquid line filter-dryers and required suction line filter-dryers.</P>

<P><li> Leak test the system using a gas such as dry nitrogen by pressurizing the system with the gas and measuring the pressure and time required for the test pressure to decrease (without makeup).</P>

<P><li> Recharge the system with the necessary amount of refrigerant.</P>
</ol>

<H3>Materials Compatibility: </H3>

<p>Chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants are generally very inert chemicals with good materials compatibility.  However, if introducing a new material to an existing system or a different refrigerant to an existing system, always check with the original equipment manufacturer to verify compatibility.</P>

<P>Refrigerants should not be mixed.  Not only are they very difficult to separate, but mixing results in radically different properties compared to the individual gases and may result in equipment damage.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </h3>

<p>High pressure gases should always be handled with great care.  Most refrigerants are inert and have very low toxicity.  Nonetheless, some are quite toxic, and some of the hydrocarbon refrigerants are flammable.  Be aware of the refrigerants being recovered, their hazards, their safe handling procedures, and their permissible exposure limits.  Monitors may be considered for use with some refrigerants (e.g., HCFC-123), especially when working in a confined space, clean room or other space with limited ventilation.  Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDSs prior to implementing any of these recovery, recycling, or reclaiming processes.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>Recovering, recycling, and reclamation of CFC refrigerants can extend the useful life of existing CFC-containing equipment by avoiding retrofits and by delaying the purchase of new ODS-free equipment due to a CFC refrigerant scarcity.  A secondary benefit results from minimizing costs and maximizing efficiencies compared to retrofitting.  Finally, re-use of existing refrigerant will prolong the time period over which the existing ozone-depleting and/or global-warming gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and so should therefore reduce the environmental impact of these refrigerants.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages: </H3>

<p>It is important to have properly trained technicians, to insure that the process is performed in accordance with the proper guidelines.  This will require initial and follow-up training.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</h3>

<p>The cost of a typical recovery/recycle system is approximately $4,000. High pressure recovery reclamation systems are approximately $17,000, and the low pressure recovery/reclamation systems range in price from about $28,000 to $32,000.</P>

<P>Recovery charge for refrigerant sent to a manufacturer&#146;s facility is on the order of $0.35/lb. Reclamation charges range from $1.25 to $1.75/lb, depending on the type of refrigerant. Combining recovery and reclamation adds approximately $0.25/lb of refrigerant in addition to the reclamation charge. For small quantities (of less than 1,000 lb) there is often a $50/hr charge with a 6-hour minimum. The following refrigerants can be usually be processed: CFC-11, CFC-12, HCFC-22, CFC-113, CFC-114, HCFC-123, HFC-134a, HCFC-141, HCFC-141b, R-500, and R-502.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Anti-seizing compounds are normally used on engine hardware (nuts and bolts) to lubricate and prevent seizing of the components due to corrosion or dirt buildup.  An industry standard product made by FEL-PRO called C-300 was renamed Moly Dry Film, and its formulation contains no ODSs.</P>

<P> FEL-PRO Moly Dry Film (formerly FEL-PRO C-300) is a combination lubricant and anti-seizing compound used on PW-F100-220 jet engines for the F-16 meeting PWA-36035.  It is a multipurpose anti-seizing compound containing molybdenum disulfide.  The compound is intended to prevent seizing of a component, due to heat, dirt buildup, or corrosion after extended use.  Before 1992, this product was formulated with an ODS and listed under NSN 8030-00-111-6266.  Since then, the product has been reformulated and is now available without any ODSs in its formulation under the NSN 8030-01-222-1995.</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>CFC-12, dichlorodifluoromethane (CAS: 75-71-8)</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> CFC-12 has been the refrigerant of choice for motor vehicle air conditioning systems until it was discovered to be an ozone-depleting substance.  New motor vehicle air conditioning systems are now using the refrigerant HFC-134a.  The imminent CFC production ban will force any CFC-12 based systems without access to reclaimed CFC-12 to convert fully to HFC-134a or to use a drop in HCFC.</P>

<P> CFC-12 is the refrigerant currently used by the majority of motor vehicle air conditioning systems now in operation.  Atmospheric CFCs have been determined to be the primary cause of stratospheric ozone layer depletion over the last quarter century as these products have made their way into the atmosphere.  The widespread use of CFCs, not only in motor vehicle air conditioning systems, but in many other applications as well, has resulted in a significant increase in the concentration of atmospheric chlorine, which reacts with ozone, reducing its stratospheric concentration, and thus destroying the ultraviolet radiation shielding ability of the ozone layer.</P>

<P> Conversion of a large number of motor vehicle air conditioning systems now using CFC-12 is likely, given the large number of existing CFC-12 based units in service and the production ban on CFCs beginning January 1, 1996.</P>

<P> It is certain that an increasing number of conversions will be done as CFC-12 based air-conditioning systems require servicing.  There may be two options, depending on the vehicle and its system and location.  The HFC-134a conversion is ODS-free, but also relatively expensive and results in reduced cooling capacity.  Tests are now underway using an HCFC or an HCFC blend designed to mimic the refrigerant characteristics of CFC-12.  Thus, using HCFCs as the refrigerant should result in better cooling performance at a lower cost.  HCFCs should be available for the converted systems until they reach the end of their useful life cycle (~2010).  Finally, any system converted to either alternative should have its CFC-12 removed and reused for servicing a vehicle with not being converted.</P>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Conversions of motor vehicle air conditioning systems now using CFC-12 to HFC-134a are expected to be relatively expensive and perhaps not totally satisfactory.  For example, a conversion will require replacement of the dryer, hoses, seals, lubricant, and refrigerant at a cost for a typical automobile system estimated at $500.  However, because of the differing physical properties of the refrigerants, systems designed for CFC-12 and converted to HFC-134a will suffer an approximate 30% reduction in efficiency, and hence cooling ability.</P>

<P>HCFC conversions are expected to be simpler and cheaper.  Component changes should be minimal, and refrigerant cost will likely be $8 to $10 a pound with a typical system using 2 to 4 pounds.  Cooling performance is expected to be comparable to the system with CFC-12.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Sterilizing agents can contain CFCs, which, because they are relatively inert, are added for safety and ease of use.  CFCs are often used as part of the formulation for sterilizing agents.  Because the sterilizing agents are oxidizers, such as ethylene oxide, and are usually very combustible, the CFCs/HCFCs serve as both fire suppressant and propellant.  A typical sterilizing mixture of ethylene oxide and CFC-12 is produced in a formulation of 12% ethylene oxide and 88% CFC-12.  The best application of this type of sterilizing agent is for heat sensitive equipment on which steam autoclaving (sterilization with heat) can not be done.</P>

<P> Despite the fact that ethylene oxide is a suspected carcinogen, some 100% ethylene oxide (CFC and HCFC free) sterilizers are in development.  Also, some ethylene oxide-free replacements have been produced; for example, hydrogen peroxide and ozone based sterilizers, but they are not yet in widespread use.</P>

<P> Ethylene oxide, although not an ODS, is a suspected carcinogen.  Use of ethylene oxide should be minimized.  In fact, relatively low levels of use (25-50  lb/yr) will trigger technical reviews of the process and may require implementation of Maximum Achievable Control Technology.</P>

<P> Some manufacturers have substituted an HCFC for the CFC, which reduces the sterilizers ozone depleting potential, but does not eliminate it.  Two tradenames of these products are Penngas 2 and Oxyfume 2000.</P>

<P>N/A</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Retrofitting or repairing an existing EO/CFC based sterilizer that is less than 5  years old to an EO/HCFC mixture based sterilizer is cheaper than purchasing new equipment based on one of the new technologies.  It would be best if possible to delay purchases of any new sterilizers until the new technologies have been thoroughly evaluated.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A process that allows recovery of the VOCs for reuse is cryogenic condensation. The condensation process requires very low temperatures so that VOCs can be condensed. Traditionally, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants like CFC-12 have been used to condense the VOCs, but with the phase-out of these ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), liquid nitrogen has emerged as a viable substitute for use in the extremely low temperature or cryogenic (less than -110 degrees C) condensation process. Cryogenic condensation is best suited to exhaust streams with low flowrates (below 600 standard ft<SUP>3</SUP>/min) and/or vapor concentrations above 40 parts per million on a volumetric basis (ppmv).</P>

<P> Cryogenic condensation is a versatile process which is not VOC specific. Typically, condensation takes place with liquid nitrogen as the refrigerant in a straightforward heat exchange process. Non-toxic, non-corrosive, and non-flammable, liquid nitrogen is a versatile, zero ODS coolant with a normal boiling point of -196 degrees C.</P>

<P>As the organic-laden vapor stream is cooled, VOCs will condense when the dew point is reached. Fluctuations in VOC stream velocity or content are easily handled by quick response controls on liquid nitrogen injection. Typically, the only constraint on the VOC itself is that its freezing point should be below about -30 degrees C; otherwise, freezing is likely to occur.</P>

<P>Cryogenic condensation systems generally consist of one or a series of shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The VOC stream and the liquid nitrogen stream flow through the heat exchanger countercurrently, maximizing heat transfer. The VOC condenses on the shell side of the exchanger then drains into a collection tank, from which it can be recycled, reclaimed, recovered for reuse, or, at worst, accumulated for disposal.</P>

<P>During condensation, the presence of water vapor or VOCs with a high melting point can cause freezing on the external surface of the tubes inside a cryogenic condenser. A solid buildup will blanket the heat transfer area and thus reduce the efficiency of the process, unless suitable precautions are taken. One method of preventing buildup due to freezing is to periodically flush the pipes with the condensed phase. Another method is to use two condensers in parallel so that one condenser is in operation while the other is out of service being cleaned or defrosted. Another option when excessive moisture is a concern is to arrange two condensers in series. In the first or pre-cooling stage, the VOC stream is cooled to about 1 degree C, condensing the majority of water so that it will not be present to freeze at condensing temperatures below 0 degrees C. In the second, or main, condensing stage, the temperature of the VOC stream can be lowered as needed to drop out the required/desired amount of VOCs without concern of ice formation.</P>

<P>For some VOCs, substantial cooling -40 to -50 degrees C below the compound&#146;s dew point may cause fog to form. This occurs when the rate of heat transfer exceeds the rate of mass transfer to the liquid stage, causing the bulk of the gas to quickly cool below its dew point. This causes the nucleation of tiny droplets of the VOC which, instead of coalescing and condensing on the surface of the tube, become a colloidal suspension in the bulk gas stream. The formation of fog, like the formation of solids, can be minimized by splitting the cooling process into steps, allowing better control of temperature changes. Other options to minimize fog formation include the use of a mist elimination device or reduction of the gas stream velocity by using a larger diameter inlet pipe.</P>

<P>Air sweeps can sometimes be replaced with nitrogen sweeps to enhance the recovery of VOCs from the vent gas. Because the amount of VOC recovered is proportional to the fraction of VOC in the vapor (expressed as the partial pressure of the component), recovery rates are increased at higher vapor concentrations. For example, if a 5 percent concentration of VOC in a gas stream is technically feasible, but the vent stream concentration is controlled at 0.5 percent in air to eliminate the risk of explosion, that is, the concentration is controlled below the lower explosion limit, (LEL), then the addition of nitrogen can render the atmosphere inert and at the same time allow a VOC concentration of 5 percent, without which the mixture would be explosive. Thus, VOC recovery is increased, while maintaining safe operating conditions.</P>

<P>Cryogenic condensation has been selected as the Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT) by environmental regulators for VOC control in a few processes.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> There are virtually no material compatibility problems from a chemical standpoint with the cryogenic condensation process because the VOC stream and the nitrogen stream never come in direct contact. Heat exchanger materials of construction must, of course, be compatible with both streams and the low temperature operation. Typically, 316 stainless steel is used, since no carbon steel or cast iron is allowed in cryogenic service.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> High pressure gases and cryogenic fluids should be handled with great care. Always chain or secure high pressure cylinders to a stationary support such as a column after moving, but before using. Always wear personal protective equipment when using cryogenic fluids, since exposure to skin could cause severe frostbite. Volatile organic compounds should be used only in areas with adequate ventilation, in enclosed process equipment, or by personnel wearing the proper protective equipment (respirator or supplied air).</P>

<P>Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDSs prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Reduces the amount of VOCs and ODSs emitted into the environment.</P>

<P><li> Does not contaminate the recovered product.</P>

<P><li> Good reliability due to the low number of moving parts.</P>

<P><li> No secondary pollution is created, e.g., no wastewater, no nitrogen oxides, no acid gases, no dioxins.</P>

<P><li> Very low operating costs if liquid nitrogen is already being used at a facility for blanketing tanks or purging equipment.</P>

<P><li> Systems have essentially 100% turndown and are excellent in intermittent applications having a big variation in demand.</P>

<P><li> Typical outlet VOC concentrations range from 5 to 2,000 ppmv, depending on emission requirements and the system in place. The efficiencies of these systems approach those of incinerators, but offer more flexibility in operation and lower operating costs compared to incinerators.</P>

<P><li> If inlet gas is contaminated with just a single VOC, reuse is especially promising. Multiple VOCs in a vent stream will be recovered, but cryogenic condensation is not a fractionation operation; thus, if high purity components are required for reuse, separation of a VOC mixture must be done with a separate alternative technology. See Major Assumptions for a more detailed explanation of this point.</P>

<P><li> Installation costs are low, since the units come essentially fully assembled.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li>  </B> VOCs are often released or captured as mixtures in large volume gas  streams</P>

<P><li> Condensed mixtures are typically not easily separated even by subsequent reclamation</P>

<P><li> To maximize purity and minimize cross-contamination, batches may have to be separated by purging and flushing of the system</P>
</ul>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> Commercially available system capacities vary from small units handling 25 scfm of spent gas to large systems handling 10,000 scfm. Units with capacities greater than 500 scfm are custom designed and assembled on skids or a number of skids for transport. Typically, units 500 scfm and smaller are standard modules that are customized to the application. Approximate costs for essentially fully assembled cryogenic recovery systems are as follows:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> $50K for a 25 scfm unit</P>

<P><li> $150K to $200K for a 100 scfm unit</P>

<P><li> $500K for a 500 scfm unit</P>

<P><li> Units larger than 500 scfm can cost up to several million dollars.</P>
</ul>

<P>Operating costs are relatively low, provided a ready source of liquid nitrogen is used at the site for some other purpose such as tank blanketing. A typical 500 scfm system consumes about 10 kW of power and 200 to 300 scfm of liquid nitrogen. For facilities with no continuous source of liquid nitrogen, several options are available:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> For an intermittent, single-use installation, e.g., VOC recovery from semi-annual ship off-loading, the required amount of liquid nitrogen could be brought in for the duration of off-loading.</P>

<P><li> For continuous use, combination systems with mechanical refrigeration (for the bulk condensation) and liquid nitrogen (only for polishing) can be assembled. This type of combination system is much more efficient if liquid nitrogen has to be purchased solely for this process.</P>
</ol>

<P>A more meaningful economic analysis can only be done knowing the value of the VOC and the concentration, flowrate, and availability of liquid nitrogen at the facility. In general, greater efficiency can be gained by designing the system for countercurrent contact of the streams using the cooling capacity of the &#147;warm&#148; liquid nitrogen from the main condenser to cool the incoming warm or ambient temperature VOC vapors in the pre-condenser.</P>

<P> Assumptions:  Cryogenic condensation technology using liquid nitrogen is not a fractionation process. It will condense essentially all the components of a vapor stream with the exception of elemental gases like hydrogen, helium, and neon, including gases as light as methane. Recovery and reuse of pure VOC streams from a cryogenic condensation system is the ideal application of this technology. However, VOCs are often released or captured as mixtures in large volume gas streams. Although the cryogenic condensation process will recover these materials, condensed mixtures are typically not easily separated even by subsequent reclamation. Another possibility for mixtures includes sale for another application that tolerates a mixture. Cryogenic condensation systems can also accommodate different VOC streams if production processes allow batches, e.g., single contaminant streams. To maximize purity and minimize cross-contamination, batches may have to be separated by purging and flushing of the system.</P>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents: </B>Sodium Nitrite (7632-00-0), Heavy Metals</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Navy generates over 10 million gallons of sodium nitrite-contaminated wastewater from marine steam boiler maintenance operations, which include hydroblasting cleaning, hydrostatic pressure testing, lay up, and rinsing. The sodium nitrite added to feed water prevents the flash rusting of the boiler&#146;s metal surfaces. The nitrite level of 800 mg/l prohibits the discharge of the wastewater. Currently, NPDES prohibits the discharge to surface water of wastewater containing 1 mg/l of nitrites.</P>

<P> The addition of sulfamic acid to the wastewater effectively removes sodium nitrite by reducing the nitrites to form sodium bisulfate, diatomic nitrogen, and water. The addition of sodium hydroxide to the wastewater results in the formation of a precipitate effectively removing heavy. The treatment process generates sludge from the initial settling and heavy metal flocculation which must be dewatered and disposed as a hazardous waste. The unit removes sodium nitrite to a level below the NPDES level of 1 mg/L.  Therefore the wastewater can be discharged to the sanitary sewer system. The unit will be implemented sometime in FY96.</P>

<P> The system consists of mixing tanks, metering pumps, filters, and chemical sensors. The influent enters a feed settling tank for gravity settling of large suspended particles. The wastewater then undergoes nitrite reduction through the addition of a 15% solution of sulfamic acid (NH<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>3</SUB>H).  For heavy metal precipitation, sodium hydroxide is added to the wastewater. The sodium hydroxide forms a precipitate that removes heavy metals through coagulation and flocculation. Anionic polymer are added to aid in the precipitation of the heavy metals. The final addition of sulfuric acid neutralizes the wastewater prior to discharge.  Filters, as small as 5 microns, clean the effluent subsequent to its discharge to the sanitary sewer system. Sludge produced from the settling tank and the heavy metal precipitation is dewatered prior to disposal.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> Heavy metals and sodium nitrite are irritants to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Inhalation of these fumes can be toxic. Proper personal protection equipment is, therefore, recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>

<p>This system demonstrates an effective process to convert nitrite to nitrogen gas. It will allow for treatment of wastestream produced by the marine steam boiler maintenance which had gone to contractors for disposal. This will result in an substantial costs savings. This technology will potentially be available in stationary and mobile treatment units.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>Effective only on waste stream generated from boiler steam cleaning.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The 600-gallon transportable unit is currently under development by NFESC and will be implemented by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division. The projected annual cost savings Navy-wide will be $17 million. The unit should reduce disposal costs by 95% from $3.50 per gallon contracted disposal, to $0.15 per gallon treatment costs.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Supercritical fluid is a high pressure cleaning process that takes advantage of the fact that the fluid chosen becomes an extremely effective solvent for many organic materials, once in its supercritical state. It is a cleaning process that penetrates small openings and is especially useful for precision or intricate components like gyroscopes, accelerometers, nuclear valve seals, laser optic components, special camera lenses, electromechanical assemblies, and porous ceramics.  The process works well removing liquid contaminants, including silicone, petroleum and dielectric oils, flux residues, lubricants, adhesive residues, and fats and waxes.  However, it is not very effective on heavy soils, nor for removal of particles or salts, except in circumstances where it is used in conjunction with agitation or ultrasonic cleaning.</P>

<P>The supercritical point is the pressure and temperature condition above which a chemical can no longer be vaporized, but, at the same time, the fluid does not retain its liquid-phase characteristics. Supercritical fluids have qualities unique to their fluid state; that is, unlike the characteristics and properties of either the vapor or the liquid phases.  Small changes in temperature and pressure produce significant changes in density and solvent power.  This combination of characteristics allows for greater mass transfer rates, effectively decreasing the time required to move the contaminants into the bulk supercritical fluid stream, thus providing rapid cleaning. </P>

<P>Carbon dioxide is probably the most widely used fluid in supercritical cleaning applications.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> is especially useful, since it is non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-ozone depleting; has a supercritical temperature near ambient temperatures (good for temperature sensitive parts); and exhibits excellent solvent properties in its supercritical state.  Carbon dioxide supercritical cleaning does require high operating pressures in the range of 1,500 to 2,000 psig, but operating temperatures of only 35 to 65&#176;C. As a result, most supercritical cleaning equipment has been designed for high pressure operation and is relatively small. High pressure cylindrical chambers of supercritical cleaning equipment are intended to hold primarily small, intricate parts or parts with deep crevices, tiny holes, or very tight tolerances that normal alternative precision cleaning processes, specifically aqueous or semi-aqueous processes, have difficulty cleaning. </P>

<P>A basic CO<SUB>2</SUB> supercritical cleaning system has two primary cleaning vessels: the extraction vessel, in which the component to be cleaned is placed and flooded with supercritical carbon dioxide and, as the CO<SUB>2 </SUB>dissolves the contaminants, it flows to a separator vessel where the fluid is subjected to a pressure and temperature change (pressure is reduced and the carbon dioxide vaporizes). As that occurs, the solubility of the contaminant in the carbon dioxide decreases, causing the contaminant to separate from the bulk fluid. Once all the CO<SUB>2</SUB> is evacuated from the separator, the concentrated contaminant is usually in residue form, often as an oily or tar-like liquid that is simply drained from the separator.  The residue can then be recovered, recycled, or reused, if suitable; otherwise, the residue is disposed as the sole component; no solvents, wastewater, or other contaminants are present to increase the volume of waste disposed.</P>

<P>The greatest concern when using supercritical cleaning processes is the safety risk of high operating pressures. Equipment must be properly maintained to prevent over pressure or failure of high-pressure components. Although carbon dioxide is non-toxic and non-flammable, it can displace oxygen and cause asphyxiation if leakage occurs in closed, occupied spaces.  A CO<SUB>2</SUB> monitor may be useful for closed areas, despite the fact that there are early warning symptoms, primarily difficulty in breathing (unlike nitrogen, which can quickly cause asphyxiation without warning).</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Carbon dioxide, in its supercritical state, is compatible with virtually all metals; however, non-metallic components, such as plastics, gaskets, and o-rings must be checked for compatibility. In general, cross-linked polymers and high density polyethylene are not affected by CO<SUB>2</SUB> supercritical cleaning.  Cellulose acetate butyrate is one plastic that is not compatible with supercritical carbon dioxide. Other plastics that are susceptible to damage from supercritical cleaning are generally affected because the carbon dioxide solvates the plasticizers within the plastic and once removed, the absence of plasticizer tends to make the cleaned plastics more brittle.  This is usually an undesirable result for plastic components. Compatibility should always be checked and tested, if necessary.</P>

<P>The extremely high pressures at which supercritical cleaning takes place make it unsuitable for components containing gas or evacuated spaces because they could implode or deform during the cleaning cycle.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<p> The primary safety concern when using supercritical fluids is the high pressure operating range of the equipment. Proper design, operation, and maintenance are critical to safe use of the equipment. In addition, the hydrocarbon gases are flammable; thus, their use requires excellent maintenance measures to safeguard against leaks.</P>

<P>Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>Some of the benefits are an equally high degree of cleanliness; relatively short cleaning times, typically 15 to 30 minutes; completely dry parts at room temperature (no supplemental drying is needed); low operating costs; contaminants are the sole waste; and systems are typically closed-loop, designed to maximize recycling of the carbon dioxide. For difficult applications, the addition of agitation will usually provide a significant improvement in a supercritical fluid system&#146;s cleaning ability, as well as reduce the time required for cleaning.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>The disadvantages of supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning are high capital costs, poor removal of hydrophilic (polar molecules) contaminants, high-pressure operation, and, as a result, limited component size, due to equipment design pressure constraints. Development work using co-solvents to aid cleaning of hydrophilic contaminants is in progress.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Supercritical cleaning systems are expensive, but operating and waste disposal costs are usually low.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Installed cost of a supercritical carbon dioxide system can range from $60K to $300K for once-through CO<SUB>2</SUB> use, depending on the complexity of the controls and other components. Recovery and recycling of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> will add $25K to $50K. (Sometimes liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB> at 800 to 900 psig can be used as an alternative to supercritical CO<SUB>2</SUB> if the contaminant is readily soluble in liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB>. This can reduce the equipment cost by 10 to 15%.)</P>

<P><li> Operating costs are low; power costs are minimal because cycles are short and no heat is input into the process. Furthermore, liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB> is approximately $0.10/lb (in bottles).</P>

<P><li> Maintenance costs under contract can run $15K per year, according to one manufacturer.</P>

<P><li> Waste disposal costs are lower than competing cleaning technologies that require disposal of spent solvent, wastewater, or blasting media, since the waste residue is 100% contaminant. In some cases, there is no disposal of waste, since the contaminant can be recovered, recycled, or reclaimed.</P>
</ul>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A molten metal bath is at the core of the Catalytic Extraction Process (CEP), developed by Molten Metal Technology, which converts hazardous wastes into products of commercial value.  The liquid metal acts as a catalyst and solvent in the dissociation of waste feed and the synthesis of products.  Molten metal causes complex compounds in the feed to be dissociated into their elements, which readily dissolve in the liquid metal solution.  By adding select co-reactants and/or controlling operating conditions, the dissolved elemental intermediates can be reacted to form desired products of commercial value.  Thermodynamics determine product synthesis, while solution equilibria determine partitioning between the metallic, ceramic, and gaseous product streams.  </P>

<P> The gaseous product stream contains mostly synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can be used as a feedstock by the chemical industry or as a low NO<SUB>x</SUB> fuel.  Synthesis gas can also be separated to form pure hydrogen and carbon monoxide, both useful feedstocks for the chemical industry.  The gaseous product stream can also contain commercially valuable acids such as hydrochloric acid.  The ceramic product stream will contain alumina (Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) and silica (SiO<SUB>2</SUB>) along with the oxide forms of other non-reducible metals.  The ceramic material contains no detectable levels of organic compounds and passes the TCLP extraction test for all metal constituents.  The ceramic material can be processed into industrial abrasives, construction materials, or refractory base.  By tapping the metal bath, reducible metals in the feed can be recovered as metal alloys and recycled.  Volatile heavy metals in the feed, such as mercury, zinc, and lead, may evolve from the metal bath as vapors and can be recovered from the gas phase using a cold trap or high-efficiency filter.  </P>

<P> Feed conversion efficiency in the metal bath is driven by solvation effects with the carbon concentration being a key variable affecting feed conversion efficiency.  The lower the carbon concentration relative to saturation, the more efficient feed conversion per unit time is achieved.  Reducing the carbon concentration in the liquid metal at constant operating conditions can increase the destruction efficiency by several orders of magnitude.  At high carbon concentrations, the addition of oxygen from the feed or as a co-reactant will convert the carbon into carbon monoxide which will be removed as a gaseous product.</P>

<P> The CEP process has been designated by EPA as BDAT for all waste streams.  In addition, the CEP process has received a determination as a recycling technology by the EPA, California, Texas, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Ohio.  The CEP process can also process low level radioactive wastes achieving an eight to 100 fold volume reduction.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A high temperature vitrification process can convert hazardous waste into a nonhazardous glass/ceramic matrix which can be used as a commercial product.  Organic components in the waste stream are gasified by the system and utilized as an auxiliary energy source.  Inorganic components of the waste stream are incorporated into the glass/ceramic matrix.  The glass/ceramic matrix is extremely stable and passes typical regulatory leachate tests. </P>

<P> The vitrification system consists of four sections, (1) feed preparation, (2) preheater, (3) vitrifier/converter, and (4) air pollution control/off gas treatment system.  The feed preparation system consists of a counter-current rotary drum dryer, batch surge bin to maintain uniform waste feed and allow for the addition of glass formers, and auger feeders to convey the waste to the preheater.  The preheater is an indirect gas-fired auger preheater which heats the waste to over 1100&#176;F.  This effectively gasifies the organic contaminants contained in the waste stream to allow them to be used as fuel.  The vitrifier/converter heats the inorganic waste to 2700&#176;F in a well mixed chamber.  Oxygen enriched natural gas is the primary energy source for the vitrifier/converter.  The molten glass/ceramic exits the vitrifier through a discharge system that allows the molten material to be shaped into useful products.  Flue gas from the vitrifier flows through a high temperature heat exchanger.  The cooled flue gases pass through a dry baghouse for particulate capture, a wet acid/gas packed tower venturi scrubber, an ammonia scrubber to remove NOx, and an activated carbon filter to remove any trace organics.  Dust from the baghouse is recycled back into the vitrification process.  </P>

<P> Waste streams which can be processed with the vitrification process include garnet residues, plating wastes, sand blast media residues, waste water sludges, paint residues, asbestos, medical waste, and incinerator ash.  Waste volume reductions as high as 75% have been achieved with this process.  In addition to the glass/ceramic product a wastewater stream is produced from the flue gas wet scrubber.  This process can also process low level radioactive wastes resulting in a stable radioactive glass/ceramic matrix.</P>

<P> This type of vitrification system is being investigated for applicability at McClellan and Tinker Air Force Bases.  Currently the Navy is pursuing another type of vitrification system which uses Joule electrical heating for treating hazardous wastes in Hawai&#146;i.  There are several other types of vitrification systems such as Plasma Arc, Vortec type, etc.</P>

Operators must also be trained in hazardous waste operations as required by OSHA and EPA regulations. </P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Treatment of radioactive wastes will produce a radioactive glass which needs to be handled according to applicable regulations for radioactive materials</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P><B>Applicable EPCRA Targeted Constituents:</B> Chromium (CAS: 7440-47-3) and Other Heavy Metals</P>
<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center is demonstrating a sodium sulfide/ferrous sulfate process (patented by the United States Air Force) to remove heavy metals from wastewater. A pilot plant study was conducted at Naval Air Station Pensacola and the process is being demonstrated at Naval Undersea Warfare Center Keyport.</P>

<P> This physical/chemical treatment process uses sodium sulfide and ferrous sulfate to remove heavy metals from wastewater through precipitation at normal or alkaline pH. Ferrous and sulfide ions act together to reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium to form a precipitate. The ferrous ion acts with the sulfide, aiding in the reduction of chromium at neutral or alkaline conditions. The ferrous and sulfide precipitate further removes suspended and dissolved metals through coagulation and flocculation.</P>

<P> The coagulation and flocculation system used by sodium sulfide and ferrous sulfate is similar to other chemical-physical treatment methods used to remove metals from wastewater. The system consists of two mixing tanks with chemical feeds and a clarifier, followed by an activated sludge basin and final clarifier. The influent must be kept above a pH of 7.0 to prevent offgassing of hydrogen sulfide from the addition of sodium sulfide. The wastewater must also be kept between a pH of 7.2 and 7.5 when the ferrous sulfate is added to ensure the proper coagulation and reduction of chromium. External recycled sludge and anionic polymer are added to the chemical tank effluent to aid in the flocculation process. This mixture enters the clarifier for settling and clarification.</P>

<P> The clarifier is used to settle flocculant from the wastestream. The clarifying chamber contains internal sludge recycling to aid in settling. The effluent from the clarifier must pass through a sludge blanket, which aids in the removal of fine particles. The floc produced from this process is very light in weight and volume, and has a tendency to form very fine particles. The process must operate at optimum conditions to ensure discharge levels below regulatory standards.</P>

<h3>Material Compatibility:</h3>

<p>N/A</P>

<H3>Safety and Health: </H3>

<p> Sodium sulfide and ferrous sulfate have mild dermal and oral effects. Chromium, on the other hand, is known to have shown carcinogenic effects, thus making it a potentially dangerous substance to handle. It also has corrosive effects on skin and mucous membranes. Care should be taken when handling other heavy metals. Most of them are absorbed by the skin and have detrimental effects. Proper personal protective equipment is, therefore, highly recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local Industrial Health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing any of these technologies.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
 
<p>This system has several benefits over treatment methods currently in use. This method substantially decreases the amount of sludge generated and chemicals used while producing lower metal levels in treated effluent. Sludge generation is reduced 90% by volume (when compared to sulfuric acid/sulfur dioxide/lime treatment method). This means a tremendous savings in sludge disposal costs for most wastewater treatment plants. Chemical usage is cut by 40% (when compared to sulfuric acid/sulfur dioxide/lime treatment method). No pretreatment or post treatment (i.e., water softening) is needed, which results in operational cost savings.</P>

<P> This process is highly efficient at removing suspended and dissolved metals from a wastewater stream. It can effectively reduce hexavalent to trivalent chromium, allowing it to be removed by flocculation. This process can also remove cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc, among other contaminants. It has an application in treatment of metal-bearing wastewater generated by operations such as plating, paint stripping, and metal cleaning.</P>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>

<p>If the batch becomes acidic (pH less than 7), then there is the possibility of hydrogen sulfide generation. However, this should not occur because the process is not designed to operate in acidic conditions.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<p> The cost for this treatment system must be determined on a site-by-site basis. Costs of wastewater treatment will vary from one location to the other.  The capital cost is approximately $250,000 regardless of plant capacity.  Other factors that affect cost include:  flow rate, and the level and type of contamination.  Each naval activity will have to examine the cost effectiveness of the treatment technology needed before selecting the treatment system.</P>

<H3>Approval Authority:</H3>

<p> Navy:  Approval is controlled locally and should be implemented only after engineering approval has been granted.  Major claimant approval is not required.</P>

<p> Wheat starch blasting is a user-friendly blasting process wherein wheat starch can be used in systems designed for plastic media blasting (PMB), as well as systems specifically designed for wheat starch blasting.  The wheat starch abrasive media is a crystallized form of wheat starch that is non-toxic, biodegradable, and made from renewable resources.  The media is similar in appearance to plastic media, except that it is softer.</P>

<P> The wheat starch blasting process propels the media at less than a 35 psi nozzle pressure for most applications.  The low pressure and relatively soft media have minimal effect on the surfaces beneath the paint.  For this reason, wheat starch is well suited for stripping paints without risking damage to the substrate.  Examples include removing paint from aluminum alloys and composites like graphite, fiberglass, and aramid (Kevlar&#153;).</P>

<P> The wheat starch blasting process can remove a variety of coatings.  Coating types range from resilient rain-erosion resistant coatings found on radomes and radar absorbing materials to the tough polyurethane and epoxy paint systems.  The wheat starch system has been shown to be effective in removing bonding adhesive flash (leaving the metal to metal bond primer intact), vinyl coatings, and sealants.  It has also been found effective in removing the paint from the cadmium parts, while leaving the cadmium plating intact.</P>

<P> There are several important components required for wheat starch systems.  First, a moisture control system is needed to control the storage conditions of the medium.  This is especially important when the system is shut down for extended periods of time.  Second, to remove contaminants from the wheat starch media, the spent wheat starch residue is dissolved in water and then either filtered or separated in a dense particle separator/centrifuge.  The wheat starch media is recycled in the system and may be used for up to 15 to 20 cycles.  Low levels of dense particle contamination in the media may result in a rough surface finish on delicate substrates.  The waste stream produced from this process is sludge generated from the wheat starch recycling system.  This system produces approximately 85% less waste sludge compared to chemical stripping.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Wheat starch blasting can be used on metal and composite surfaces.  Direct contact of wheat starch with water must be avoided to maintain the integrity of the blast media.  Wheat starch blasting requires explosion protection.  If conditions are right, a static electrical charge developed by a high velocity wheat starch particle in air could effectively ignite the material.  Preventive measures must be taken.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> As with any blasting operations, airborne dust is a major safety and health concern.  Proper precautions should be taken to ensure that personnel do not inhale dust/particulate matter.  Additional protective measures should be taken when stripping lead, chromate, zinc chromate, or solvent-based paints, as these components may be hazardous.  Inhalation of lead and zinc compounds can irritate the respiratory system and some compounds are known to be carcinogenic.  Inhalation of paint solvents can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<P><li> Waste generated from this process can be treated in a bioreactor</P>

<P><li> Waste volume requiring subsequent disposal is estimated to be only five percent of the original volume</P>

<P><li> The wheat starch blasting process can be used for removing coatings from both metallic and composite materials</P>

<P><li> This process is very controllable; it can be used to selectively remove from one to all coating layers</P>

<P><li> Wheat starch blasting does not cause fatigue to the substrate surface.</P>

<P><li> Moderate stripping rates can be achieved while maintaining a gentle stripping action</P>

<P><li> Requires complex subsystems for media recovery and recycling and dust collection and control</P>

<P><li> Operator training required</P>

<P><li> Low levels of dense particle contamination in the media may result in a rough surface finish on delicate substrates</P>

<P><li> Waste material may be hazardous waste and require disposal which may be costly</P>

<P><li> Typically slow to moderate stripping rate</P>

<P><li> Operators must wear personal protective equipment</P>

</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Capital costs for wheat starch blasting systems will vary, depending upon the application.  A PMB system can be modified for a cost of approximately $10,000 for a small application.  An automated, closed, dust-free system for a large application (e.g. aircraft) can cost up to $1.5 million.</P>

<P> The operating costs for wheat starch blasting systems have been estimated to be 50 % less than chemical paint stripping (i.e., methylene chloride).</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> The fluidized bed paint removal process is an alternative method to chemical paint stripping and degreasing of non-aluminum and non-heat-sensitive metal parts.  The most notable pollution prevention opportunity for this process is that it produces no solvent wastes. The fluidized bed paint stripper (FBPS) can be used for forged steel, but not aluminum or aluminum alloys. </P>


<P> The FBPS process removes paint or other organic coatings by heating the part to greater than 650 degrees F to cause pyrolysis and decomposition of the organic portion of the paint.  The FBPS typically consists of the following four components: 1) fluidized-bed furnace or retort, 2) fluidized-bed cooling system; 3) off-gas treatment system consisting of a cyclone, afterburner and scrubber, and 4) low energy shot-blast unit.  The fluidized-bed furnace or hot bed is where pyrolysis of the coatings takes place.  A granular material, aluminum oxide (alumina) in most cases, is used as a heat transfer medium.  Air passing through the bed keeps the media fluidized.  Parts to be cleaned are lowered into the fluidized bed, which quickly heats the part and its surface coatings (paint, grease, oil, etc.) to a temperature at which organic components of the surface material pyrolyze into carbon oxides, other gaseous combustion products, and char.  The fluidized-bed cooling system or cold bed is used to cool the parts after the organics have been pyrolyzed.  Carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during pyrolysis are burned in the afterburner.  The thermal decomposition of paint leaves some carbon and inorganic char on the part.  Most of the char may be removed in the fluidized bed; however, most parts require further cleaning before they can be repainted.  The shot-blast unit is used to remove the inorganic coatings and char to prepare the parts for repainting.</P>

<P> This process removes and destroys paint and grease from non-aluminum or non-heat sensitive materials.  Waste streams from this process includes spent heat transfer medium, spent blast media, exhaust air from the afterburner and scrubber, water discharge from the scrubber, and dust from the cyclone separator.  The heat transfer medium, blast media, and cyclone dust will contain metals from the stripped paint.</P>

<P> Field demonstrations of the FBPS have been performed at two Army Depots: Letterkenny, PA and Red River, TX.  The findings and conclusions of these demonstration projects noted specific limitations of the FBPS process.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> The FBPS process is not suitable for use with aluminum and aluminum alloy parts because these materials lose essentially all of their hardness or temper when exposed to the 700 to 800 degree F process temperatures.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Inhalation of lead and zinc chromate paints can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Leaves practically no waste paint residue, thus eliminating significant waste sludge disposal costs as well as avoiding the future liability associated with the hazardous components of the paint sludge</P>

<P><li> Uses an inert medium to clean parts of any shape, size, or geometry and coated with any type of paint.  The rapid changes in coating technology do not affect the performance of the system</P>

<P><li> Provides cleaning to the bare metal</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> FBPS is not suitable for removal of paint from aluminum and aluminum alloy parts</P>

<P><li> The fluidized bed media may be regulated as a RCRA characteristic hazardous waste because of toxicity</P>

<P><li> The FBPS process is not suitable for parts with crevices, channels, or cavities (e.g. engine blocks) that would retain FBPS media and be difficult to clean after treatment</P>

<P><li> The FBPS process has little or no effect on corrosion removal</P>

<P><li> Parts may require secondary cleaning to remove char and inorganic coatings</P>

<P><li> The amount of waste generated by the FBPS system may exceed the volume of wastes generated by a caustic stripping system</P>

<P><li> The FBPS workers and any workers in the buildings containing the system may be subject to Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requirements for employees exposed to lead under 29 CFR 1910.1025</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> The cost elements of the FBPS are compared to stripping using Water Blast Plus.  The following economic analysis shows the FBPS to have a lower annual cost than Water Blast Plus.  Water Blast Plus was chosen as the comparison technique instead of chemical stripping since it has a lower annual cost than chemical stripping.  Fluidized bed paint strippers can range from $7,000 for a small parts stripper to $800,000 for an industrial scale stripper.</P>

<P> PMB is performed in a ventilated enclosure such as a small cabinet (glove box), a walk-in booth, a large room, or airplane hanger.  The PMB process blasts the plastic media at a much lower pressure (less than 40 psi) than conventional blasting.  PMB is well suited for stripping paints, since the low pressure and relatively soft plastic medium have minimal effect on the surfaces beneath the paint.</P>

<P> After blasting, the media is passed through a reclamation system that consists of a cyclone centrifuge, a dual adjustable air wash, multiple vibrating classifier screen decks, and a magnetic separator.  In addition, some manufacturers provide dense particle separators as a reclamation system.  The denser particles, such as paint chips, are separated from the reusable blast media, and the reusable media is returned to the blast pot.  Typically, media can be recycled ten to twelve times before it becomes too small to remove paint effectively.  Waste material consists of blasting media and paint chips.  The waste material may be classified as a RCRA hazardous waste because of the presence of metals.  An alternative solution to handling a potential hazardous waste is to locate a vendor that would &#147;lease&#148; the blast media to the base and then recycle the media to recapture the metals.</P>

<P> Plastic media are manufactured in 6 types and a variety of sizes and hardnesses.  A military specification (MIL-P-85891) has been developed for plastic media.  The specification provides general information on the types and characteristics of plastic media.  The plastic blasting media types are:</P>

<P> Type I Polyester  (Thermoset)</P>

<P> Type II Urea formaldehyde  (Thermoset)</P>

<P> Type III Melamine formaldehyde  (Thermoset)</P>

<P> Type IV Phenol formaldehyde  (Thermoset)</P>

<P> Type V Acrylic  (Thermoplastic)</P>

<P> Type VI Poly(allyl diglycol carbonate)  (Thermoset)</P>

<P> PMB facilities typically use a single type of plastic media which they use for all of their PMB work.  The majority of DOD PMB facilities use either Type II or Type V media.  Type V media is not as hard as Type II media and is gentler on substrates.  Type V media is more commonly used on aircraft.  Type II is better for steel-only surfaces.</P>

<P> An option with PMB is to lease the plastic media.  Under the lease program, the used plastic media is picked up by the leasing company for recycling.  This option eliminates media waste from the PMB facility wastestream.</P>

<P> The effect that this technology has on pollution prevention is that reusing the blasting media greatly reduces the volume of spent media generated as compared to sand blasting.  When compared to chemical paint stripping, this technology eliminates the generation of waste solvent.</P>

<P> PMB is being used at Puget Sound, Charleston, and Portsmouth Naval shipyards; Naval Aviation depots (NADEPs) San Diego, Norfolk, and Cherry Point; and Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Indian Head, as well as other Navy activities and throughout the Army and Air Force.  Plastic media glove boxes and enclosed blasting booths have been installed at aircraft maintenance activities to remove paint from support equipment and components.  A blast media lease and recycle program is currently in place at NADEP Cherry Point.  A more detailed list of organizations within the DOD depot maintenance community that have implemented PMB operations is provided in Appendix III of <I>Joint Paint Removal Study; Final Report Plastic Media Blast</I>, Joint Depot Maintenance Analysis Group, Technology Assessment Division, June 1994.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Storage and handling of plastic media and blast waste associated with this process pose no compatibility problems.  Prior to using plastic media for depainting operations, personnel should check applicable military specifications [such as (MIL-P-85891)] and operations manuals for the PMB systems.  Plastic media cannot be used with a system designed for other types of media.  Some military specifications do not allow PMB for depainting certain types of materials (i.e. fiberglass, certain composites, honeycomb sandwich structures, and some applications with thin-skinned aircraft components).  In certain cases, PMB can inhibit crack detection on some of the softer alloys used for aircraft components (i.e. magnesium).</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> As with any blasting operations, airborne dust is a major safety and health concern.  Proper precautions should be taken to ensure that personnel do not inhale dust/particulate matter.  Additional protective measures should be taken when stripping lead chromate- or zinc chromate-based paints, as these compounds may be hazardous.  Inhalation of lead and zinc compounds can irritate the respiratory tract, and some compounds are known to be carcinogenic.  Inhalation of paint solvents can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Operators must wear continuous flow airline respirators in accordance with OSHA requirements as specified in 29 CFR 1910.94 when blasting operations are in progress.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Media can be recycled for use (10-12 recycling events)</P>

<P><li> Wastewater disposal costs (typical in chemical paint stripping operations) are virtually eliminated with PMB</P>

<P><li> Eliminates the production of waste solvents when compared to chemical paint stripping</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Substantial capital equipment investment is required</P>

<P><li> Solid wastes may have to be disposed as a hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Operator time, maintenance requirements, handling and disposal of waste varies upon material to be stripped</P>

<P><li> Quality of stripping is dependent on skill and experience level of the operator</P>

<P><li> Military specifications do not allow PMB for depainting certain types of materials</P>

<P><li> May not remove corrosion</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> PMB systems can range in cost from $7,000 for a small portable unit to $1,400,000 for a major facility for aircraft stripping.  The following information on investment costs and costs/payback for PMB systems at Hill AFB, Utah, was provided in <I>Joint Paint Removal Study; Final Report; Plastic Media Blast</I>, Joint Depot Maintenance Analysis Group, Technology Assessment Division, June 1994.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Automatic paint gun washers are similar to conventional home dishwashing machines, except that the thinners and solvents in the automatic washers are not heated in the process.  The washers can be used to clean conventional air spray, HVLP, electrostatic, airless, or air-assisted paint guns.  Solvents used in the automatic paint gun washer are recycled and reused in the cleaning process.  The paint gun to be cleaned is attached to a nozzle within the automatic paint gun washer, and the machine is sealed.  Most automatic paint gun washers can wash two to three paint guns at a time.  The exterior of the paint gun is cleaned with atomized paint thinner using a dishwasher action.  The interior of the paint gun is cleaned by circulating solvent through the nozzle attachment.  Automatic paint gun washers collect used solvent in a reservoir.  Impurities in the used solvent are filtered out in the reservoir.  The filtered solvent is then ready for reuse instead of being disposed as hazardous waste.  The solvent impurities form a sludge, which is collected and disposed.  The typical solvent capacity of the spray gun washer is 3 gallons; it must be changed out every 3 to 8 weeks, depending on usage.</P>

<P> The manual cleaning of paint guns can be labor intensive and can generate significant quantities of solvent wastes.  Automatic paint gun washers can reduce the amount of solvent used and paint solvent waste generated by up to 70-80% when compared to manual paint gun cleaning.  Since automatic paint gun washers are sealed units, worker exposure to hazardous materials during solvent handling is also greatly reduced.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Chlorinated solvents can not be used in most automatic paint gun washers.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Health concerns are dependent on the variety of solvent and paint that is handled.  Inhalation of lead- and zinc chromate-based paints can lead to irritation of the respiratory system.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> 70 to 80 percent cost savings for solvents used to manually wash paint guns due to solvent recycling and reuse</P>

<P><li> Reduces the amount of hazardous waste and hazardous air emissions generated</P>

<P><li> Localized handling site for solvents used for paint gun washing</P>

<P><li> Because solvent storage is localized, procurement of standardized solvent(s) are possible for this maintenance action</P>

<P><li> Accurate waste solvent classification for this maintenance action is simplified</P>

<P><li> Fully automatic, reduces labor</P>

<P><li> Pneumatically operated (non-electric) washer</P>

<P><li> Reduces worker exposure to solvent, hazardous waste and hazardous air emissions</P>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantage:</h3>
<ul>
<p><li> Users of automatic paint gun washers have noticed that if they delay washing the paint guns, the cleaning efficiency is reduced, and additional hand cleaning of the equipment is required.</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</h3>

<p>The capital cost for automatic paint gun washers will vary, depending upon the unit size, unit type, and the application.  Capital costs for these washers range from $600 to $2,400.</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> 18 spray guns are cleaned per week</P>

<P><li> Solvent required for automatic gun cleaning:  6 gallons/month</P>

<P><li> Solvent required for manual gun cleaning:  36 gallons/week</P>

<P><li> Hazardous waste disposal cost:  $20/gallon</P>

<P><li> Solvent procurement cost:  $4/gallon</P>

<P><li> Labor rate:  $30/hour</P>

<P><li> Labor, manual gun cleaning:  10 min/gun or 3 hr/week</P>

<P><li> Labor, automatic gun cleaning:  1 min/gun or 0.3 hr/week</P>

<P><li> Electrical costs are negligible</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Carbon dioxide (CO<SUB>2</SUB>) blasting is an alternative process to chemical cleaning and stripping.  The obvious advantage of CO<SUB>2 </SUB>blasting over chemical stripping is the introduction of inert media that dissipates, in this case CO<SUB>2.</SUB>.  There are two basic types of CO2 blasting systems: pellet blasting for heavy cleaning, and snow blasting for precision cleaning.</P>


<P><B>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Pellet Blasting: </B></P>

<P> CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellets are uniform in shape and the effectiveness of the pellets as a blast media is similar to abrasive blasting media.  However, the pellets do not affect the substrate; therefore, CO<SUB>2  </SUB>pellet blasting is technically not an abrasive operation.  This process can be used for cleaning, degreasing, some de-painting applications, surface preparation, and de-flashing (flashing is the excess material formed on the edges of molded parts).</P>

<P> The process starts with liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB> stored under pressure (~850 psig).  The liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB> is fed to a pelletizer, which converts the liquid into solid CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow (dry ice flakes), and then compresses the dry ice flakes into pellets at about -110<SUP>o </SUP>F.  The pellets are metered into a compressed air stream and applied to a surface by manual or automated cleaning equipment with specially designed blasting nozzles.  The CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellets are projected onto the target surface at high speed.  As the dry ice pellets strike the surface, they induce an extreme difference in temperature (thermal shock) between the coating or contaminant and the underlying substrate, weakening the chemical and physical bonds between the surface materials and the substrate.  Immediately after impact, the pellets begin to sublimate (vaporize directly from the solid phase to a gas), releasing CO<SUB>2</SUB> gas at a very high velocity along the surface to be cleaned.  The high velocity is caused by the extreme density difference between the gas and solid phases.  This kinetic energy dislodges the contaminants (coating systems, contaminants, flash, etc.), resulting in a clean surface.  Variables that allow process optimization include the following: pellet density, mass flow, pellet velocity, and propellant stream temperature.</P>

<P> CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellet blasting is effective in removing some paints, sealants, carbon and corrosion deposits, grease, oil, and adhesives, as well as solder and flux from printed circuit board assemblies.  Furthermore, since CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellet blasting is not an abrasive operation, it is excellent for components with tight tolerances.  This process also provides excellent surface preparation prior to application of coatings or adhesive and is suitable for most metals and some composite materials. However, thin materials may be adversely affected.  Blasting efficiency is approximately equal to that of other blasting operations and can approach 1 ft<SUP>2</SUP>/minute after optimization.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> blasting can be done at various velocities: subsonic, sonic, and even supersonic.  Therefore, equipment noise levels are high (between 95 and 130 dB).  This operation always requires hearing protection.</P>

<P> Waste cleanup and disposal are minimized because only the coating or contaminant residue remains after blasting.  There is no liquid waste because CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellets disintegrate.  They pass from liquid to gaseous state, leaving no spent media residue.  With regard to toxic air control, small quantities of coating particles are emitted to the air.  A standard air filtration system should be provided.</P>

<P><B>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Snow Blasting:</B></P>

<P> In contrast to CO<SUB>2</SUB> pellet blasting, CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow blasting is a low impact process.  Applications for this process are primarily in the precision cleaning domain.  A typical precision cleaning operation must clean small contaminant particles that attach to surfaces and/or surface layers of adsorbed moisture or soil due to electrostatic attraction.  These particles are so small that they have a large fraction of their surface area attached to the surface layers.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow blasting is most effective in breaking the adhesive forces and dislodging particles from the substrate surface.  Small flakes of dry ice transfer their kinetic energy to sub-micron particulate contaminants, then sublimate, lifting the particulate matter from the substrate surface as the adhesive bonds are broken.  This process is often used as a final cleaning process for sub-micron particulate and light soils removal.</P>

<P> CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow is generated from liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and is discharged directly from the nozzle of the blasting device.  The liquid CO<SUB>2</SUB> is partially vaporized as it passes through the nozzle, while the rest of the stream solidifies as pressure is reduced.  The &#147;snow,&#148; fine solid particles, is propelled by the fraction of CO<SUB>2</SUB> that vaporizes.  No compressed air or other inert gas is needed to propel the snow.</P>

<P> Most media can not be used in precision cleaning because they are too aggressive or they contaminate the component with media residue.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow, however, is ideal for this application, since it is relatively gentle in application, leaves no media residue, and is highly purified, introducing no new contaminants.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> snow blasting is often done in a clean room or cabinet purged with nitrogen to provide a dry atmosphere, minimizing moisture buildup on the component.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a completely oxidized compound is a non-reactive gas, and thus compatible with most metals and non-metals.</P>

<P> Dry ice processes are cold and can cause thermal fracture of a component.  In addition, prolonged use on a component in one spot will cause condensation and ice buildup.  However, this is rarely a problem, because CO<SUB>2 </SUB>blasting is a fast-acting, non-stationary process.  Particulate and organic contamination is either quickly removed or unable to be removed by continued blasting at a single point.  Therefore, the component temperature does not change much, since contact time is short.  Nevertheless, should component temperature drop below the dew point of the surrounding atmosphere, moisture will accumulate on the component.  This problem can be mitigated by heating the component in some manner so that its temperature remains above the surrounding atmosphere&#146;s dew point after blasting.  If components can not take heat, then blasting can be done in an enclosed space purged with a dry gas to lower or eliminate the dew point problem.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> CO<SUB>2</SUB> does not support combustion and it is non-toxic; however, it is an asphyxiant.  CO<SUB>2</SUB> will displace air since its density is greater than that of air, causing it to accumulate at the lowest level of enclosed spaces.  When blasting with CO<SUB>2 </SUB>pellets, additional ventilation should be provided for enclosed spaces.  Personal protection equipment (PPE) is also required when blasting.</P>

<P> Static energy can build up if grounding is not provided. CO<SUB>2</SUB> blasting should not be done in flammable or explosive atmospheres.</P>

<P> High pressure gases should be handled with great care.  Always chain or secure high pressure cylinders to a stationary support such as a column, prior to their use.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS for CO<SUB>2</SUB> prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> <B>CO<SUB>2</SUB> Pellet Blasting:</B>  Units come in several different configurations.  The blasting unit alone can be:</P>
<ol>
<P><li> Purchased- $25,000 to $50,000 or</P>

<P><li> Rented- $1,500 to $2,500 per month.</P>

<P><li> Units that combine pelletizing and blasting are also available, but generally are not economical unless the blasting operation is performed 24 hours/day, seven days/week</P>

<P><li> Pellet blasting jobs can be done on a contract basis for a cost between $200 to $300 per hour including labor, pellets, and equipment (not including travel time or travel expenses).</P>

<P><li> Pellet cost:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Made by a stand-alone pelletizer that can be purchased for a cost between $50,000 to $130,000 (cost to make pellets from delivered liquid carbon dioxide is about $0.10-0.15/lb), or</P>

<P><li> Purchased directly from a manufacturer for a cost between $0.10/lb and $0.50/lb delivered, depending on the purity and the distance from the manufacturer (pelletizer purchase is reported to be economical only if blasting is done more than 40 hours/week).</P>
</ul>
</ol>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> High and medium pressure water blast systems are used for paint stripping surfaces with low-volume water streams at pressures ranging from 3,000 to 15,000 psi (medium pressure operations), to over 15,000 to 55,000 psi (high pressure operations).  The medium pressure systems may be augmented.  For example, sodium bicarbonate [ This application is discussed in greater detail in the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Data Sheet Sodium Bicarbonate Stripping Processes.]  may be added to the water stream, or environmentally compliant chemicals may be applied to painted surfaces prior to water blasting.  High pressure systems typically use pure water streams.  With both medium and high pressure water systems, specialized nozzles can be used to achieve effects ranging from a relatively gentle, layer-by-layer removal of organic paints to removal of metal flame spray coating and other tough, tightly adherent coatings.  The process water, paint, and residue are collected by the effluent-recovery system for filtering the paint and residue, removing leached ions (copper, cadmium, lead, etc.), microparticulates, chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, and other contaminants. The water is then passed through a coalescing tank for removing oils and film, then through charcoal filter, microfilters and, finally, a deionization system to ensure that the water is Grade A deionized water.  The recovered deionized water is recycled back into the process.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</h3>

<p>No material compatibility problems have been documented for use of high and medium pressure water processes to de-paint metallic surfaces.  The use of specific chemicals to augment medium pressure water processes must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</P>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Sodium bicarbonate stripping processes are used as alternatives to traditional chemical paint stripping. Bicarbonate of soda (or sodium bicarbonate) is a soft blast media with a heavier specific gravity and less hardness than most plastic abrasives.  The bicarbonate of soda stripping process can be used with or without water.  It is most frequently used with water, which acts as a dust suppressant.  In this form, compressed air delivers sodium bicarbonate media from a pressure pot to a nozzle, where the media mixes with a stream of water.  The soda/water mixture impacts the coated surface and removes old coatings from the substrate.  The water used dissipates the heat generated by the abrasive process, reduces the amount of dust in the air, and assists in the paint removal by hydraulic action.  Workers do not need to prewash or mask the surface of the material being stripped.  The solid residue from the wastewater generated from this process can be separated by settling or filtration.</P>

<P> The effectiveness of bicarbonate of soda stripping depends on optimizing a number of operating parameters, including nozzle pressure, standoff distance, angle of impingement, flow rate, water pressure, and traverse speed.  In general, bicarbonate of soda stripping systems remove paint slower than most methods (other than chemical paint stripping) currently used.  The type of equipment used in this stripping process may also have significantly different results (e.g. Aqua Miser&#210; vs. the Accustrip System&#210;).</P>

<P> Use of sodium bicarbonate in its dry form (or when not fully mixed with water) can create a cloud of dust that will require monitoring and may require containment to meet air standards.  The dust generated is not an explosive hazard, nor is sodium bicarbonate toxic in this form.  However, the airborne particulates generated from the stripping operation can contain toxic elements from the paint being removed  This stripping process should be performed in areas where exhaust particulates can be contained and/or exhaust ventilation system controls are present to remove hazardous airborne metals.  If bicarbonate of soda stripping is operated outdoors, air monitoring of dust (e.g. for metals) may be necessary to ensure that air standards are met.  However, tests have shown that lead will adhere to the sodium bicarbonate, thus reducing the risk.  Be sure to have your local Industrial Health Specialist check the air for any resident metals.</P>

<P> The waste generated from bicarbonate of soda stripping systems in the wet form is a wet slurry consisting of sodium bicarbonate media, water, paint chips, and miscellaneous residues such as dirt and grease.  Some installations are employing centrifuges to separate the water from the contaminated waste stream, thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste being disposed. Filtered wastewater containing dissolved sodium bicarbonate may be treated at an industrial wastewater treatment plant.  In its dry form, waste generated includes nuisance dust, paint chips, and miscellaneous residues such as dust and grease. The solid waste may be suitable for disposal in a sanitary landfill.  Analysis of wastewater and waste solids is required prior to disposal.  Wastewater and bicarbonate residue disposal requirements will depend on the toxicity of the coatings and pigments to be removed.  The sodium bicarbonate media can not be recycled.  The paint chip and miscellaneous residue wastes may be considered a hazardous waste.</P>

<P> Currently, bicarbonate of soda stripping is not approved by NAVAIR for depainting aircraft.  NAVAIR&#146;s primary concern is that at temperatures of 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, sodium bicarbonate may convert to sodium carbonate, which is corrosive.</P>

<P> This technology has been tested at the USMC Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia.  They tested sodium bicarbonate media in three types of commercial off-the-shelf equipment.  The cost of these systems ranged from $15,000 (Accustrip 16W) to $40,000 (Aqua Miser E25 and Jet Stripper DP-1).  The Aqua Miser and Jet Stripper use medium-pressure water to remove paint with sodium bicarbonate injected to assist in removal effectiveness (with the Aqua Miser system, the sodium bicarbonate flow can be turned on and off as necessary).  Accustrip uses a stream of 30 to 90 psi air and sodium bicarbonate, and is combined with a stream of blast water at the nozzle to try to eliminate the dust.  In both cases, the sodium bicarbonate medium is then propelled against the surface, and the sharp edges of the media blast paint away from the base metal.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Material compatibility must be evaluated with respect to the item being cleaned.  Uninhibited sodium bicarbonate and water residue can corrode substrates; however, current testing indicates that the corrosion potential of inhibited formulations is similar to that of organic solvent strippers.  Results from an Air Force test program (Tasking Directive I-90) indicated that there was excessive corrosion of aluminum cladding materials when sodium bicarbonate and water slurry were used.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Health concerns are dependent on the variety of paint to be removed.  Inhalation of lead- and zinc chromate-based paints can lead to irritation of the respiratory system.  Some lead compounds are carcinogenic.  Solvent-based paints can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.</P>

<P> Because of the noise and dust produced (the amount of dust produced will vary from system to system), a sodium bicarbonate stripping system should only be operated in an isolated area outdoors or indoors in a confined or remote area.  Operators must wear double hearing protection; an air-hood blast helmet with an air-supplied respirator and optional half mask (for those blasting systems that generate large amounts of dust), or a full-faced air purification respirator with HEPA filters; and protective clothing (e.g. rain suits, rubber gloves, and safety-toed rubber boots, depending upon the substrate coating).</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Significant reduction in the amount of hazardous waste generated compared to chemical stripping</P>

<P><li> Reduces the number of hours required for paint stripping in comparison to chemical stripping</P>

<P><li> Selectively removes individual coating layers</P>

<P><li> Prewashing and masking is not required in most applications</P>

<P><li> No size limitations for parts being stripped</P>

<P><li> Wastewater stream may be centrifuged to reduce its volume or treated (if required) at industrial wastewater treatment plants available to many installations</P>

<P><li> Blast media is usually less expensive than PMB, wheat starch, and CO<SUB>2 </SUB>pellets</P>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<P><li> Requires subsequent washing of the item; thus, electrical components cannot be exposed to this stripping process</P>

<P><li> The sodium bicarbonate solution can not be recycled for stripping, although the water can be separated for disposal</P>

<P><li> May require monitoring</P>

<P><li> Containment may be required</P>

<P><li> Not approved by NAVAIR for depainting aircraft</P>
</ul>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> Sponge blasting systems are a class of abrasive blasting process using grit-impregnated foam and non-abrasive blasting media using foam without grit.  The sponge blasting system incorporates various grades of water-based urethane-foam cleaning media used to clean and prepare surfaces.  The non-abrasive media grades are used to clean delicate substrates.  The abrasive media grades are used to remove surface contaminants, paints, protective coatings, and rust from a variety of surfaces.  In addition, the abrasive grades can be used to roughen concrete and metallic surfaces, if desired.  The abrasive media contains a variety of grit, depending upon application, including aluminum oxide, steel, plastic, and garnet.</P>

<P> The foam cleaning media is absorptive and can be used either dry or wetted with various cleaning agents and surfactants to capture, absorb, and remove a variety of surface contaminants such as oils, greases, lead compounds, chemicals, and radionuclides.  The capability of using the foam cleaning media wetted also provides for dust control without excess damping of the surface being cleaned.  The equipment consists of three transportable modules, which include the feed unit, the classifier unit, and the wash unit.</P>

<P> The feed unit is pneumatically-powered for propelling the foam cleaning media.  The unit is portable and produced in several sizes (depending on capacity required).  A hopper, mounted at the top of the unit, holds the foam media.  The media is fed into a metering chamber that mixes the foam cleaning media with compressed air.  By varying the feed unit air pressure and type of cleaning media used, sponge blasting can remove a range of coatings from soot on wallpaper to high-performance protective coatings on steel and concrete surfaces.</P>

<P> The classifier unit is used to remove large debris and powdery residues from the foam media after each use.  The used media is collected and placed into an electrically-powered sifter.  The vibrating sifter classifies the used media with a stack of progressively finer screens.  Coarse contaminants, such as paint flakes, rust particles, etc., are collected on the coarsest screens.  The reusable foam media are collected on the corresponding screen size.  The dust and finer particles fall through the sifter and are collected for disposal.  After classifying, the reclaimed foam media can be reused immediately in the feed unit.  The abrasive media can be recycled approximately six times and the non-abrasive media can be recycled approximately 12 times.</P>

<P> During degreasing applications, the foam media must be washed every three to five cycles.  The washing of the foam media takes place in the wash unit, which is a portable centrifuge, closed-cycle device.  The contaminated wash water is collected, filtered, and reused within the wash unit.</P>

<P> This system removes paint, surface coatings, and surface contaminants from a variety of surfaces.  Waste streams produced from this system includes coarse contaminants, such as paint flakes, rust particles; dust and finer particles; and the concentrated residue from the bottom of the wash unit.</P>

<P> The effect that this technology has on pollution prevention is that the stripping media can be recycled (10-15 events) and the quantity of wastewater which is typically generated using conventional methods (chemical stripping) is greatly reduced.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Sponge blasting systems are compatible in most situations where other types of blasting media have been used.</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> As with any blasting operations, airborne dust is a major safety and health concern.  Proper precautions should be taken to ensure inhalation of dust/particulate matter is avoided.  Additional protective measures should be taken when stripping lead chromate- or zinc chromate-based paints, as these compounds may be hazardous.  Inhalation of lead and zinc compounds can irritate the respiratory tract, and some compounds are known to be carcinogenic.  Inhalation of solvent vapor can irritate the lungs and mucous membranes.  Prolonged exposure can affect respiration and the central nervous system.  Proper personal protective equipment should be used.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<hr>

<H3>Overview:</H3>

<p> A vacuum sanding system is essentially a dry abrasive blasting process [e.g., sand blasting or plastic media blasting (PMB)] with a vacuum system attached to the blast head to collect the blast media and the removed coating material (paint or rust).  The unit then separates the used blast media from the removed coating material.  The remaining blast material is recycled for further use and the coating material is disposed.</P>

<P> This system is designed to replace chemical paint stripping, but with three added advantages.  The first advantage is the collection of both the blasting media (sand, PMB, or other media) and the collection of the waste coating material being removed.  The second advantage is that the media is separated from the waste material by a reverse pulse filter, and the media is reused in the system, thereby minimizing the quantity of media required.  The third advantage is that, due to the confinement of the blast material, this technology may be used where it is impractical to use traditional sandblasting or chemical stripping.</P>

<P> This system is a stand-alone system, including the air compressor to drive the system.  It is portable (skid mounted) and can be moved by a forklift.  The air compressor is a trailer unit (2-wheeled).</P>

<P> If PMB is used as the media in the vacuum sanding system, the used media can be passed through a reclamation system that consists of a cyclone centrifuge, a dual adjustable air wash, multiple vibrating classifier screen decks, and a magnetic separator.  In addition, some manufacturers provide dense particle separators as a reclamation system.  The denser particles, such as paint chips, are separated from the reusable blast media, and the reusable media is returned to the blast pot.  Typically, media can be recycled ten to twelve times before it becomes too small to remove paint effectively.  Waste material consists of blasting media and paint chips.  The waste material may be classified as a RCRA hazardous waste because of the presence of metals.  An alternative solution to handling a potential hazardous waste is to locate a vendor that would &#147;lease&#148; the blast media to the base and then recycle the media to recapture the metals.  (See Plastic Media Blasting [PMB] Paint Stripping Process.)</P>

<P> The effect this technology has on pollution prevention is that the portable vacuum sander removes coatings and corrosion from composite or metal structures while capturing the media and solid waste.  Vacuum sanding eliminates airborne particulate matter and potential lead dust exposure hazard.  When compared to chemical paint stripping, this technology eliminates the generation of waste solvent.</P>

<P> Vacuum sanding is being used at NAVSTA Everett located in Everett, Washington.  The original application of this technology was to remove paint on asphalt as well as for maintenance of large service pipelines leading to NAVSTA Everett.  When NAVSTA Everett de-paints pipelines on naval piers, the U.S. EPA requires complete recovery of waste materials, making both traditional sand or water blasting and chemical stripping impractical.</P>

<H3>Materials Compatibility:</H3>

<p> Storage and handling of sand or plastic media and blast waste associated with this process pose no compatibility problems.  Collection systems should not mix different types of waste (i.e., pipeline paint and paint from asphalt) to ensure the most economic disposal can be obtained for each.  Prior to using plastic media for de-painting operations, personnel should check applicable military specifications [such as (MIL-P-85891)] and operations manuals for the PMB systems.  Some military specifications do not allow PMB for de-painting certain types of materials (i.e., fiberglass, certain composites, honeycomb sandwich structures, and some applications with thin-skinned aircraft components).  In certain cases, PMB can inhibit crack detection on some of the softer alloys used for aircraft components (e.g., magnesium).</P>

<H3>Safety and Health:</H3>

<P> Airborne dust, which is a major safety and health concern with any blasting operations, is essentially eliminated using the vacuum blasting system.  However, in order for the vacuum system to be effective, the vacuum and blasting head must be kept in contact with the material being stripped of paint or corrosion.  Therefore, training in the proper use of the equipment is essential.  In addition, eye protection and hearing protection are recommended.</P>

<P> Consult your local industrial health specialist, your local health and safety personnel, and the appropriate MSDS prior to implementing this technology.</P>

<H3>Benefits:</H3>
<ul>
<p><li> Improves personnel safety by eliminating airborne particulate matter and potential lead dust exposure hazard</P>

<P><li> Eliminates the need for the use of respirators while blasting</P>

<P><li> Separates waste material from blasting media, therefore, the media can be recycled</P>

<P><li> Vacuum sanders are versatile and can use multiple media types</P>

<P><li> Wastewater disposal costs (typical in chemical paint stripping operations) are virtually eliminated with vacuum sanding</P>

<P><li> Eliminates the production of waste solvents when compared to chemical paint stripping</P>

<P><li> Portable unit</P>

<P><li> Self-supplied power/air compressor</P>

<P><li> Minimal emissions from portable (mobile source) diesel air compressors, so no air permit required</P>

<P><li> Minimizes the clean up time since blast material is contained</P>

<P><li> Other activities can continue nearby without interruptions</P>

<P><li> Contains contaminated coatings</P>
</ul>

<H3>Disadvantages:</H3>
<ul>
<P><li> Substantial capital equipment investment is required</P>

<P><li> Used blasting materials and waste coating material may have to be disposed as a hazardous waste</P>

<P><li> Operator training is critical to success and safety of operation</P>

<P><li> Operator time, maintenance requirements, handling, and disposal of waste varies upon material to be stripped</P>

<P><li> Quality of stripping is dependent on skill and experience level of the operator</P>
</ul>

<H3>Economic Analysis:</H3>

<P> Vacuum sanding systems can range in cost from $17,000 to $40,000, excluding the portable generator to operate the system.  The following information on investment costs and costs/payback for a vacuum sanding system at NAVSTA Everett, Washington was published in the Arthur D. Little report <I>Site Assessment Pollution Prevention Equipment at NAS North Island SUBASE, Bangor, NAVSTA Pascagoula, and NAVSTA Everett, </I>August 1995.</P>

<P> The following analysis compares a vacuum system to a traditional sand blasting system (although the sand blasting system may not be able to be used based on EPA constraints described in the overview).</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Assumptions:</P>
<ul>
<P><li> Labor rate: Vacuum Sanding (VS) and Traditional Sandblasting (TS) - $45/hr</P>

<P><li> Work load: VS and TS - 7200 square feet de-painted per year</P>

<P><li> Rate of de-painting: VS and TS - 4 square feet per minute</P>

<P><li> Total hours per year including setup/operation/cleanup: VS - 40 hrs/yr; TS - 80 hr/year</P>

<P><li> Materials: VS - plastic media rental cost $2.50/lb, includes disposal of waste segregated from media x 1,500 lbs/yr = $3,750/yr; TS - material cost $1.50/lb x 1,500 lb = $2,250/yr</P>

<P><li> Disposal:  VS - $0; TS - $.60/lb x 15,000 lb + $36/drum x 25 drums = $9,900</P>

<P><li> Utilities:  VS and TS - Diesel fuel $1.00/gallon x 60 gallons/yr = $60</P>

<P><li> Equipment maintenance:  VS - $2,200; TS - $700</P>

<p>
It is difficult to maintain film thicknesses of less than 1.5 mils,

especially on complex geometries.

<p>
High-solids alkyds tend to have higher viscosities than high-solids

polyurethanes of similar VOC content.

New from Sherwin-Williams is Industrial Enamel HS, a high solids, low VOC

alkyd gloss topcoat for interior and exterior industrial use. The product

has a VOC content below 2.83 lbs/gal. (340 g/L). According to the company,

the coating resists chipping, flaking, and abrasion as well as dirt and

yellowing in industrial environments. It is recommended for tanks,

bridges, pipes, vessels, handrails, machinery, and equipment. It can be

applied by brush, roller, or spray over properly primed and previously

painted surfaces.

<h3 align=center>Curing</h3>

<p>
Epoxy esters can be air-dried at ambient temperatures; faster cures can be

achieved using forced-air at higher temperatures of 194 F (90 C).

<p>
Epoxy esters cure by evaporation followed by auto-oxidation. Some epoxy

esters require metallic drying agents to effect total curing. These curing

agents, which are supplied as part of one package system, lose their

potency with age.

<h3 align=center>General Information</h3>

<p>
Epoxy esters are single-component coatings. They are harder and more 

chemically resistant than alkyds.

<p>
Epoxy esters are available in either solvent- or water-borne formulations.

<p>
Epoxy esters are available in high-solids formulations.

<p>
Epoxy esters are air- or force-dried at temperatures less than 194 F (90 C).

<p>
Epoxy esters can be easily pigmented with normally available mixing

equipment.

<p>
Some epoxy esters have gained FDA approval for use on food containers and

beverage containers.

<p>
Typical applications are maintenance primers and machinery finishes.

<h3 align=center>Process Considerations</h3>

<p>
Storage stability is excellent for solvent-borne epoxy esters.

<p>
Coatings maintain a constant viscosity provided the temperature remains

constant.

</h2>
<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Application Methods</h3>

<p>
High-solids paints can be applied with conventional equipment, which makes

them readily accessible to small- and medium-sized facilities and users of

trade-sales paints.

<p>
High-solids alkyds can be applied with conventional air-atomizing spray,

airless, air-assisted airless, high volume low pressure (HVLP), and

electrostatic spray guns.

<p>
In many cases, no special application equipment is required, and because of

its good adaptability to high-speed lines, it is often applied with

reciprocating electrostatic equipment, such as turbo bells and discs on

fast-moving conveyor lines.

<p>
Some formulations require the coatings to be heated during spray

application to adequately lower the viscosity for application.

<h3 align=center>Surface Preparation</h3>

<p>
High-solids alkyds are less sensitive to the surface cleanliness of

substrates than most other coatings.

<p>
The most common problems associated with chemical pretreatment systems are

poor adhesion and premature corrosion failure. Frequently these problems

are caused by residual soils, flash rust, aluminum oxide, and inadequate

rinsing.

</h2>
<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Performance</h3>
<p>
Performance properties are similar to those of conventional solids alkyds.

<p>
Gloss and color variations can occur from one surface to the next, owing

to uneven film thicknesses.

<p>
High-solids alkyds tend to be relatively soft coatings initially. Hardness

improves over a period of days to a final pencil hardness value of 

approximately HB.

<p>
High-solids alkyds tend to have limited resistance to long-term ultraviolet

(UV) exposure. Chalking and color fading will occur.

<p>
High-solids alkyds exhibit poor resistance to alkalinity, chemicals,

solvents, and immersion in water.

<p>
Preferred choice of coatings for many low-to-medium-cost items or large

machinery that cannot be subjected to high-temperature ovens.

<p>
Some fast-drying modified alkyds cannot be recoated within a window of

time.

<p>
Styrenated alkyds have increased chemical resistance compared to pure alkyds.

<p>
Alkyd melamine resins give durable finishes with excellent weatherability

but are considerably higher in cost than other alkyds.

<p>
Alkyd-melamine finishes are usually employed only in baking finishes.

<h3 align=center>General Information</h3>

<p>
Alkyds are the major resins used in combination with others to introduce

air-dry capabilities in a paint formulation.

<p>
Alkyds come close to being the "general all-purpose paint" because of their

good overall properties and their moderate cost.

<p>
High-solids alkyds are commonly used as general-purpose shop primers for

steel and other substrates.

<p>
High-solids alkyds are single-component coatings with performance properties

similar to those of conventional solids alkyds.

<p>
High-solids alkyds can be formulated as primers or topcoats.

<p>
High-solids alkyds can be air-dried at ambient temperatures; forced-air

drying at temperatures less than 194 F (90 C) is preferable.

<p>
High-solids alkyds are available in a wide range of colors, all gloss levels,

and a wide range of texture finished. They are easy to touch-up.

<p>
Alkyds can be modified with other resins to change or improve their final

properties, such as hardness, gloss retention, color retention, and sunlight

resistance.

<p>
High-solids alkyds can be applied to most substrates.

<p>
High-solids alkyds are not recommended for application directly to zinc or

zinc-coated surfaces. A non-alkyd primer should be used instead.

<h3 align=center>Performance</h3>
<p>
Epoxy esters have very poor color retention upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV)

light. They also chalk very heavily soon after UV exposure.

<p>
Yellowing may occur and is dependent upon the formulation.

<p>
Because of their poor weathering characteristics, epoxy esters may only be

used as primers in applications involving exterior exposure; they should

be top-coated as soon as possible. Epoxy esters may be used as top-coats

for applications involving only interior exposure.

<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Performance</h3>
<p>
Solvent-borne- two-component epoxy coatings are hard, flexible, heat

resistant, and have excellent adhesion properties. 

<p>
They can be formulated into a wide range of colors and gloss levels. 

<p>
They are resistant to many chemicals, solvents, alkalies (such as soap 

and detergent), salt water, fresh water, and hot water. 

<p>
When the curing agent (component B) is a polyamide, the resulting epoxy

coating has improved toughness and flexibility. When maximum chemical

resistance is required, component B is usually a polyamine. 

<p>
The main disadvantage of solvent-borne two-component epoxy coatings is 

that they have poor resistance to UV light Exposure to UV light results 

in chalking, loss of color and loss of gloss and color; however, chalking

does not significantly affect the chemical properties of the coating.

<p>
They are often used as primers because of their excellent adhesion. They

can be used as top coats; however, their poor resistance to UV light is a

major consideration. Common uses for solvent-borne two-component epoxy

coatings include: military, marine, offshore drilling platforms, ships,

bridges, tanks, pipelines, and electrical applications.

<p>
Pittsburgh Paints reports the properties of generic epoxy coatings as

follows:

 -    Color/gloss retention:   poor

 -    Adhesion:                excellent

 -    Acid resistance:         good

 -    Base resistance:         excellent

 -    Flexibility:             good

 -    Solvent resistance:      good

 -    Abrasion:                excellent

 -    Fresh water:             good

 -    Dry heat:                250 F

 -    Dry time:                fair

 -    Corrosion:               excellent

<p>
Products are available that meet military specifications such as

MIL-P-23377 (primer), MIL-P-53022 (primer), MIL-C-22750 (top coat), and

MIL-P-24441 (primer and top coat).

<p>
Some formulations can be applied in films greater than 5 mils (in one

application). With high solid formulations it is difficult to obtain

dry-film thicknesses less than 1.5 mils (particularly when coating complex

geometries).

<p>
It is difficult to strip cured coating from a damaged part.

<h3 align=center>General Information</h3>

<p>
Epoxies have excellent water resistance and one of the highest resistances

to attack by alkali of any commercial resin.

<p>
Epoxies form hard, tough, salt- and water-resistant coatings and exhibit

superior chemical resistance as well.

<p>
Two-part epoxies can be cured at ambient temperatures when it is impossible

to bake the part.

<p>
Two-part epoxies are especially valuable in the marine industry where extreme

corrosion-resistance is required and painting must be done under any weather

conditions.

<p>
The major weakness of epoxies is their tendency to chalk when exposed to

ultraviolet light.

<p>
Chalking contributes to loss of gloss but is rarely extreme enough to

interfere with the structural integrity of the coating.

<p>
Epoxies should not be used where appearance is critical.

<p>
Acrylic epoxy hybrids are used in applications where the hardness,

flexibility, and chemical resistance of an epoxy is desired.

<p>
Epoxies are somewhat costly.

<p>
Catalyzed epoxy coatings are usually supplied as two discrete packages.

When mixed, they begin to react, producing a tough, flexible, cross-linked

film.

<p>
These coatings are well-known for their excellent adhesion to substrates.

<p>
Epoxies should not be applied at temperatures lower than 60 F.

<p>
They are used where resistance to alkalis, and some chemicals and solvents,

is desired. They are very resistant to fresh and salt water, so they are

used on off-shore drilling rigs, ships, and bridges. They are also used to

coat tanks and pipelines containing potable water.

<p>
Polyfunctional amine epoxy coatings have excellent chemical resistance, but

show less flexibility than most other epoxies. They are used in

applications where chemical resistance is of primary importance. These

coatings can cause severe dermatitis if the fumes come into contact with

skin; therefore, strict safety procedures are necessary. Their pot-life

also tends to be short.

<p>
Polyamide epoxy coatings are harder and more flexible than polyfunctional

amine epoxy coatings. Polyimide epoxy coatings do not cause dermatitis and

they have a longer pot-life. However, their chemical resistance is not as

good as the polyfunctional amine coatings.

<h3 align=center>Environmental</h3>

<p>
Solvent-borne two-component epoxy primers and top coats are available with

VOC contents in the range of 168-420 g/L (1.4 - 3.5 lb/gal).

<p>
High solids products with low VOC contents are also available.

<p>
Mixed, unapplied coatings must be disposed as hazardous waste.

<p>
VOC content is below the RACT limit for all states, including California.

Two-component epoxies (solvent-borne) are an ideal choice for a primer

where emission reductions are important.

<p>
The corrosion-resistant formulations contain chromates, and therefore must

be disposed of as hazardous waste. Some air pollution control agencies

place severe restrictions on the emissions of chromate-containing

particulates (i.e., paint overspray), which can be emitted into the air

from spray booth stacks. This can be overcome by installing high-

efficiency dry filters, but careful monitoring is required to ensure that

the regulatory limits are not violated.

<h3 align=center>Substrate</h3>

<p>
Solvent-borne two-component coatings can be used on a wide variety of

substrates including: most metals, composites, plastics, wood, ceramics,

masonry, paper, and glass.

<p>
Epoxies are excellent candidates for primers due to their heat-and

abrasion-resistance properties and excellent adhesion to most substrates.

<p>
Epoxies are one of the best metal primer resins that can be used in

industrial applications.

<h3 align=center>Safety</h3>

<p>
Protective clothing and respirators should be used during mixing and

application of most solvent-borne two-component epoxy coatings. Severe

dermatitis may result if unreacted amine is inhaled or contacts skin. When

polyamide resins are used in place of polyamine resins, severe dermatitis

is not likely.

at 150 F. However, these times can vary significantly, therefore, individual

product labels should be reviewed and followed.

<p>
To achieve maximum performance and adhesion of coating, adequate surface

preparation/cleanliness is important. Procedures for cleaning metal surfaces

vary with the type of metal being cleaned and the type of contaminants to be

removed. Common cleaning techniques include:  mechanical cleaning, solvent

cleaning, aqueous cleaning, acid cleaning, and alkaline cleaning.

</h2>
<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Application Methods</h3>

<p>
Air- or force-dried solvent-borne two-component epoxy coatings consist of

two materials: an epoxy resin (component A) and a curing agent (component

B) such as a polyamine, polyamide, or polysulfide. These two components

must be thoroughly mixed in exact proportions shortly before application to

achieve specified coating performance. In some cases, an induction period

of 20-30 minutes is required before the mixed coating should be applied.

<p>
Mixing of the two components starts the curing process, therefore, the "pot

life," or time until the coating can no longer be applied, is an important

consideration. Typical pot lives range from 4-6 hours.  Generally, the pot

life of epoxy-polyamide coatings is longer than the pot life of

epoxy-polyamine coatings. However, pot life can vary significantly,

therefore, individual product labels should be reviewed and followed.

Higher temperatures will shorten pot life.

<p>
Solvent-borne two-component epoxies can be applied using most standard

procedures: spray, rolled, brushed, etc.  In cases where large amounts of

a two-component coating are used or when the pot life is very short, it may

be advantageous to use plural component spray equipment. When using this

type of equipment the two components are stored separately then fed to the

spray gun in individual lines. Each component is metered separately to a

mixing chamber; eliminating the need for premixing, thereby resulting in

exact ratios and reducing waste generation..

<p>
Solvent-borne two-component epoxy coatings should not be applied at ambient

temperatures less than 50-60 F or they may not cure properly.

<p>
Most vendors of two-component systems can supply formulations below the

RACT limits for California, 2.8 lb/gal (340 g/L).

<p>
Recently introduced isocyanate-free urethane-type paints, which are for all

purposes nearly identical in performance to isocyanate-containing urethane

coatings, are considerably safer.

They can be applied to steel, aluminum, plastics, composites, wood, masonry

and other material; however, in many cases, they are applied over an epoxy

primer.

<p>
For coating heat-sensitive substrates with a low-solvent-content paint,

urethanes are often the materials of choice.

<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Process Considerations</h3>

<p>
Two-component systems require mixing in prescribed proportions. The two

components can be batch mixed by manually mixing immediately prior to use

or by using automatic metering equipment. This measures each component 

in the prescribed amount, where they are mixed just prior to application.

<p>
For two-component catalyzed urethanes, and two-component polyol urethanes,

pot life is limited after the two packages are combined. The pot-life can be

less than 4 hours for some high-performance polyurethanes.

<p>
Equipment must be cleaned before the coating begins to set.

<p>
As with all two-component systems, there is a limited pot life. This can

be less than four hours for some high-solids polyurethanes.

<p>
Single-component moisture-cured high-solids polyurethanes are available

with VOCs less than 3.5 lb/gal (420 g/L).

<p>
Recently introduced isocyanate-free urethane-type paints, which are for all

purposes nearly identical in performance to isocyanate-containing urethane

coatings, are considerably safer.

<h3 align=center>Surface Preparation</h3>

<p>
Surface cleanliness and freedom from any oil or grease, both on the surface

and in application equipment, is essential for good film quality and

adhesion.

<p>
The most common problems associated with chemical pretreatment systems are

poor adhesion and premature corrosion failure. Frequently these problems

are caused by the residual soils, flash rust, aluminum oxide, and inadequate

rinsing.

<p align=center><img alt="---------------------------------" src="redbar.gif"></p>
<h3 align=center>Application Methods</h3>

<p>
The principal advantage of moisture-curing urethanes is that the final

one-pack product requires no field mixing. Coatings can be applied by

brush, roller, trowel, squeegee, or spray without great demands on the

applicator.

<p>
The fluid hose leading to the spray gun and the headspace above the coating

in the pressure pot or reservoir must be free of moisture to prevent

premature curing. A nitrogen blanket can be used to keep the headspace dry.

<p>
Because of the relatively low viscosities that are exhibited by the low-VOC

polyurethanes, they can be spray-applied with standard equipment:

conventional air atomizing, airless, air-assisted airless, HVLP, or

electrostatic.

Urethanes cost two to five times more than other paints.

<p>
These coatings are expensive relative to competing technologies, but this

is usually offset by their enhanced properties.

<h3 align=center>Performance</h3>
<p>
ASTM has classified polyurethanes into six types. Four of the six types

are one-component urethanes. The one-component urethanes, and their

typical applications, are as follows:

 Type I.  "One-package prereacted" polyurethanes.  

 These coatings are also called uralkyds, urethane-modified alkyds,

 urethane alkyds, and oil-modified urethanes.  They are often used as

 automobile refinish coatings, and wood and floor finishes because they

 provide improved scuff, water, and stain resistance over those of

 conventional alkyds.

<p>
 Type II.  "One-package, moisture-cured" polyurethanes.  

 They are often used as sealers for concrete and wood, floor finishes,

 and deck finishes.

<p>
 Type III.  "One-package, heat cured" polyurethanes.  

 These coatings are often used in coil coatings and electrical wire

 coatings.

<p>
 Type VI.  "One-package nonreactive lacquer" polyurethanes.  

 The lacquers are low-solids, approximately 10-15% by weight.  They have 

 very high gloss, and are used for fabric coatings.

<p>
Urethanes are physically durable and show excellent water and weather

resistance.

<p>
These coatings are known for their excellent physical film performance:

abrasion resistance, toughness, and hardness up to pencil hardness 6H.

<p>
At least six types of urethane paints are possible, but two-part urethanes

(polyol and isocyanate) have the best film properties (abrasion resistance,

toughness, and hardness).

<p>
Of all resin technologies available, polyurethanes rank among the best for

resistance to many solvents and chemicals.

<p>
They are available in a complete range of gloss and texture levels.

<p>
Individualized touch-up is possible.

<p>
Like many high-solids coatings, it can be difficult to achieve a uniform

film thickness on complex-shaped parts.

<p>
They exhibit excellent outdoor durability and are therefore the popular

choice for a major portion of the transportation industry.

<p>
Urethanes can contain two types of isocyanates-aliphatic or aromatic.

Aliphatic isocyanates are more costly, and are used for urethane coatings

that require excellent sunlight resistance and no discoloration. Aromatic

isocyanates are particularly prone to discoloration, which almost always

takes the appearance of yellowing.

<h3 align=center>Process Considerations</h3>

<p>
It is critical that all of the coating pigments and solvents are totally

free of water.

<p>
Because this is a single component system, there are no pot life

considerations.

<p>
Equipment must be cleaned before the coating begins to set.

<h3 align=center>General Information</h3>

<p>
Urethanes are among the most frequently-used paints, because of their ability

to combine gloss and flexibility with great chemical and stain resistance.

<p>
Urethanes make ideal high-solids coatings that require little, if any,

additional heat for curing.

<p>
For coating heat-sensitive substrates with a low-solvent content, urethanes

are often the materials of choice.

<p>
Polyurethanes are usually used to coat transportation equipment, such as

automobiles, buses, trucks, and aircraft, because of their excellent

weatherability and durability.

<p>
Polyurethanes are coatings formed by the reaction of a polyisocyanate with

a polymer that contains hydroxyl functionality. Two-component polyurethanes

are supplied in two containers. One container can either be clear or

pigmented, offering a wide range of colors and gloss levels. The second

container contains a multifunctional, prepolymerized isocyanate. Upon

mixing, the components react to form cross-linked polyurethanes.

<h3 align=center>General Information</h3>

<p>
One component polyurethanes cure in the presence of moisture from the air.

<p>
Single-component polyurethanes are not yet available in a wide range of

colors or in small quantities and may have a limited shelf life.

<p>
Single-component systems have all the advantages of two-component

polyurethane systems.

<p>
Very few companies sell moisture-curing polyurethanes because manufacture

is more complex.

<p>
Currently, they are primarily supplied for military uses and are available

in military camouflage coatings.

<p>
Urethanes are among the most frequently-used paints, because of their

ability to combine gloss and flexibility with great chemical and stain

resistance.

<p>
Polyurethanes are usually used to coat transportation equipment, such as

automobiles, buses, trucks, and aircraft, because of their excellent

weatherability and durability.

<h3 align=center>Performance</h3>
<p>
ASTM has classified polyurethanes into six types. Two of the six types are

two-component urethanes. The two-component urethanes, and their typical

applications, are as follows:

 Type IV.  "Two-package catalyzed" polyurethanes.

 These coatings are not widely used.

<p>
 Type V.  "Two-package polyol" polyurethanes.

 These coatings are high-solids in nature.  They are used in

 high-performance areas such as automobile refinishes, original

 automotive clear coats over pigmented decorative coatings, 

 aircraft coatings, bus and truck coatings, and industrial-structure

 maintenance coatings.

<p>
Urethanes are physically durable and show excellent water and weather

resistance.

<p>
These coatings are known for their excellent physical film performance:

abrasion resistance, toughness, and hardness up to pencil hardness 6H.

<p>
At least six types of urethane paints are possible, but two-part urethanes

(polyol and isocyanate) have the best film properties (abrasion resistance,

toughness, and hardness).

<p>
Of all resin technologies available, polyurethanes rank among the best for

resistance to many solvents and chemicals.

<p>
They are available in a complete range of gloss and texture levels.

<p>
Individualized touch-up is possible.

<p>
Like many high-solids coatings, it can be difficult to achieve a uniform

film thickness on complex-shaped parts.

<p>
They exhibit excellent outdoor durability and are therefore the popular

choice for a major portion of the transportation industry.

<p>
Urethanes can contain two types of isocyanates--aliphatic or aromatic.

Aliphatic isocyanates are more costly, and are used for urethane coatings

that require excellent sunlight resistance and no discoloration. Aromatic

isocyanates are particularly prone to discoloration, which almost always

takes the appearance of yellowing.

<p>
Two-component systems require mixing in prescribed proportions.

<p>
New technologies allow formulation of high-solids solvent-borne two-

component systems that retain good solvent resistance, good flexibility,

4-hour pot life, good curing profile, and low VOCs of 2.08 lb/gal.

<h3 align=center>Safety</h3>

<p>
Unreacted isocyanates in urethanes can cause respiratory problems if their

vapors are inhaled for extended periods.

<p>
Approved charcoal-cartridge filter masks or head shrouds with a separate

air supply are recommended for persons applying two-part isocyanate-

containing urethanes.

<p>
No filter or cartridge masks are approved for isocyanate-containing

urethanes by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or

the National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH). To gain OSHA and

NIOSH approval, the wearer must be able to detect any possible malfunction

of the device. Since isocyanates have no recognizable odor, and no fail-

safe indicator is available to reveal when a cartridge is spent, face masks

cannot be approved for use when applying isocyanate-containing paints.

<p>
Paint operators must use appropriate respirators, because polyisocyanates

can sensitize a small percentage of the population who come in contact with

it, or who inhale the fumes.

<p>
High-solids coatings usually rely on ketones, esters, and alcohols for 

viscosity reduction. The result is a noticeable difference in odor.

They can be applied to steel, aluminum, plastics, composites, wood, masonry

and other material; however, in many cases, they are applied over an epoxy

primer.

<p>
For coating heat-sensitive substrates with a low-solvent-content paint,

urethanes are often the materials of choice.

<p>
Polyurethanes can cure at ambient temperatures. Unlike epoxies and

latexes, they can be used even under sub-zero conditions.

<p>
Moisture in the formulation or application environment can cause bubbles,

pinholes, downglossing, or hazing, in two-component urethanes. Oxazolidine

moisture scavenger (a paint additive) has been introduced to reduce or

eliminate these problems.

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size="6"><strong>MUTUAL FUNDS: BAD
DATA? </strong></font></font></p>
<p>Unfortunately Mutual Funds are not giving out accurate and
timely information about their capital gain distributions and so
many charts are hoplessly distorted, as shown below:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>BAD DATA: SELL SIGNAL. <img
src="images/profit-1.gif" align="bottom" width="52" height="52">
CORRECTED DATA: NO SIGNAL!</strong></font></p>
<p><img src="images/fund-ng.gif" align="bottom" width="234"
height="270"> <img src="images/fund-ok.gif" align="bottom"
width="234" height="270"></p>
<p>Computerized monitoring of Mutual Funds is impossible when
this kind of outrageous data error is permitted. Not only do
individual charts give false signals, <em><strong>all</strong></em><em>
sorting and ranking programs become meaningless.</em> <u>How can
you rank performance when historical net asset values are in
error by </u><strong><u>10%</u></strong><u> or more and these
errors can persist for </u><strong><u>weeks</u></strong><u> or
even </u><strong><u>months</u></strong><u> at a time?</u></p>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a minor problem. 30% of the Funds
that Crocker Investments monitors gave this kind of false signal
in 1996. That means that as many as1000 Funds are affected. <font
color="#FF0000">The <strong>Mutual Fund Industry</strong> should
set up a computerized data bank for distributions so that <strong>ALL</strong>
the data services could tap in by modem and thus eliminate the <strong>Mutual
Fund BAD DATA MESS.</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font color="#400040"><strong>BAD DATA</strong> is just one of <strong>many</strong>
problems facing Mutual Fund Investors, such as high Fund sales
&amp; management costs, generally <strong>poor</strong>
performance and a <strong>lousy </strong>safety record during
severe declines. For example, even after the bad data was fixed,
it is obvious that the T. Rowe Price OTC Fund, <strong>OTCFX,</strong>
which only made a profit of <strong>7-8%</strong> during the last
six months, isn't in the same class as the <strong>Crocker-5
System (CRKR-5)</strong> profit of <strong>70-80 %</strong> over
the <em>identical time period.</em> </font></p>
<p><font color="#400040"><img src="images/cr5-fund.gif"
align="bottom" width="457" height="294"></font></p>
<p><font color="#400040">OTCFX can move quickly at times (in the
down direction, that is). In 1987 the Fund lost 15% in a matter
of days, as shown in the chart below:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size="5"><strong>BIG DROP IN 1987:</strong></font></font><font

align="bottom" width="38" height="328"></font></p>
<p><font color="#400040">So Investors who want <strong>performance
PLUS safety</strong>, may be well advised to consider the <strong>Crocker-5
System, CRKR-5:</strong></font><font color="#FF0000"><strong> </strong></font><a

<p> Dana Merrill Gass was born October 20, 1963 in Denver, Colorado. She grew 
up in Denver, with frequent trips to the Rockies and New Mexico. Her experiences
in nature while hiking and exploring Native American ruins with her parents have
shaped her attitudes toward life and health ever since. Dana can't remember a 
time when she wasn't fascinated by scent. 

<p> In 1981, Dana enrolled at Harvard University. She returned to 
Colorado in 1983 to help organize an international business conference for
Lt. Governor Nancy Dick. By her senior year in college she had begun to 
research aromatherapy and herbal medicine. It was to turn into a business in the
spring of 1985. Kamala Perfumes (a nickname taken from the novel 
<i>Siddhartha</i> by Hermann Hesse) started at local craft fairs in the 
Boston area.
In June of 1985 Dana graduated with a B.A. Cum Laude in East Asian Studies.

<p> Kamala Perfumes had to be set aside for a bit when Dana's skill with 
Mandarin Chinese brought her a position teaching English at the Tang Shan 
Institute of Technology in China. However, while there she learned about oils 
and herbs she had not encountered before. After the teaching term ended, she 
travelled in India where the name Kamala really stuck (Kamala means 'lotus
blossom' in Hindi). There she found even more new oils.

<p> The next major step for Kamala Perfumes was King Richards' Faire in 
South Carver, MA in fall of 1988. After that, Dana worked as a professional 
massage therapist between faires. In 1990, Dana moved to Champaign, IL, 
where she still lives. She enhanced her knowledge of the chemical and 
biological aspects of aromatherapy at a five day workshop with
Marcel Lavabre in 1992.

<p> In the future, Dana wants to return to China and India for an extended 
working visit. She also wants to return to Colorado to open another store. 
Wherever she goes, she will always be indulging her passion for designing new 
scents and new products as owner of Kamala Perfumes.

</head>
<body>

<h2> 
<img src="picts/logotiny.gif" align=middle alt="Kamala Perfumes, Inc.">
Essential Oils </h2>
<p> Essential oils are pure, natural oils extracted from fresh plants. 
They are 75-100 times more potent than dried herbs and should be used 
with care.  They are also sensitive to sunlight and should be stored in 
a cool, dark area.

<b>All prices are subject to change without notice.</b>

Use them on the skin, in the bath, in a humidifier, on a light bulb, 
in potpourri, or in your hair. 
Some people are sensitive to certain oils and can have allergic 
reactions. Kamala cannot be responsible for individual body chemistry. 
We suggest that you always sample before purchase.</p>

<p><b> Essential oils should not be used internally. Pregnant women should avoid
the following oils: Pennyroyal, Mugwort, Marjoram, Sage, Basil, Oregano, 
Rosemary, Tarragon, Hyssop, and Cypress. 

The following list of uses are suggestions only. 
Always consult a doctor if you suspect a serious illness.</b></p>

<img src="picts/logotiny.gif" align=middle alt="Kamala Perfumes, Inc.">
Astrological & Seasonal Oils </h2>

<p>Astrological oils are designed to emphasize the positive traits and 
aid in healing the negative traits of each sign.  Kamala has researched 16th 
century correspondences between herbs and the zodiac.  She starts by blending
the appropriate herbal oils, then adds therapeutic oils to correct the
natural faults of each sign.  These oils are made when the moon is in the 
correct sign and will change dramatically on the skin.  Try them and see for 
yourself! (NOTE: All oils offered on this page are intended to serve as 
inspiration only, not to effect changes which can only come from within an 
individual.) Astrological oils are all Price Range B - ($8, $16, $40).

imparting a measure of caution and practicality.

<dt><b>Taurus </b>

while inhibiting your perpetual desire to be "right."

<dt><b>Virgo</b>
<dd>Your talent for details and practicality can blossom with the aid of 
this subtle blend of Lavender and Sandalwood, while your critical nature can 
be curbed.

<dt><b>Libra</b>
<dd>This blend of Amber and Violet emphasizes your intuitive, harmonious 
nature and de-emphasizes your indecisiveness.

</dl>
</dl>
<hr>

Throughout history, the moon has been a symbol of change. Like a story
or any of the projects in our lives, the cycle of the moon has a beginning,
a middle, and an end. These oils were created to help you attune to each of
these stages in your daily life. And remember, each ending is a beginning
of another cycle. Each of these oils is blended during the correct phase
of the moon. (NOTE: Changes must come from within an individual: these oils
are meant only as accessories to growth.)
<dl>
<dt><b>New Moon </b>
<dd>Manifest your own new beginnings! This oil is intended as an aid to 
meditation and ritual.

<dt><b>Full Moon</b>
<dd>Enjoy the fruits of your own labors!  Celebrate the bounty of the 
full moon with this oil.

<dt><b>Dark Moon</b>
<dd>An oil to celebrate the Dark Goddess of change and transformation. 
Use it when you need help in accepting change in your life.
</dl>
<hr>

Everyone loves holidays, and these blends were created to make each season
a festival! You can wear each of them at its own time of the year to
celebrate the changes. Or you can leep your favorite season close to you
by wearing its special scent year-round. Each of these oils is blended
during the appropriate season.

<dl>
<dt><b>Samhain</b>
<dd>Apple and Tolu come together to express the richness of late autumn.
As the days grow shorter and night grow cold, prepare for winter with this
deep blend.

<dt><b>Yule</b>
<dd>We all love to celebrate duing the long, dark, nights of December. 
Bayberry, Clove, and other traditional favorites team up to create this
scent of holiday cheer. 

<dt><b>Candlemas</b>
<dd>Osmanthus and Rosemary banish the gloominess of February by reminding
us that the days are getting longer. Forget cabin fever - spring will be here 
soon!

<dt><b>Ostara </b>
<dd>Strawberry and Freesia revel in the growth of spring. Fly a kite or take
a walk in the park with this playful oil.
 
<dt><b>Beltane</b>
<dd> In the musical "Camelot," Guenevere sings of "the lusty month of May."
Celebrate the warmer weather with someone special with this blend of
Patchouli and Ginger.

<dt><b>Midsummer </b>
<dd> Flowers are blooming and everything is grouwing on the longest day of
the year. Smell the summer with this blend of Pine and Five-Finger Grass.

<dt><b>Lammas</b>
<dd>The warmth of August is captured by this spicy blend of Petitgrain and
Black Pepper. Go frolic in a field or a park - summer is on its way out, the
days grow shorter.

<dt><b>Mabon</b>
<dd>Relax under the Harvest Moon. Let this Myrrh-based blend gently mellow
you as the year mellows. Appreciate your personal harvest - 
your accomplishments.

<body>

<img src="picts/logotiny.gif" align=middle alt="Kamala Perfumes, Inc.">
 Personal Scents </h1>
<p>
Kamala Perfumes, Inc. at The Loft is please to offer a very special
service for our clients. Kamala Perfumes, Inc. will create your own
personal scent. A personal scent is customized to your body type,
personality, Astrological portrait, and fragrance tastes;
in sum, YOU!
</p>
<p>
Kamala will blend a selection of the finest quality essential
oils and fragrance oils from around the world to meet your
individual tastes. This fragrance is YOURS! You can give it 
any name you wish - your name, perhaps! Kamala keeps all the
recipes safe in her computer file. We will not sell your 
personal scent to any other client. When you run out of your 
personal scent, Kamala will resupply it for you.
</p>
<p>
Any employee of Kamala Perfumes, Inc. at The Loft can make an 
appointment for your Personal Scent Consultation. 
Full payment is required at the time the appointment is made. 
Custom scents vary in price depending on what oils are used. 
Generally 1/3 oz. is $35.00 and 1 oz. is $60.00.
</p>
<p>
Consultations last from 15-30 minutes. Expect Kamala to ask 
you lots of questions about yourself: the more she knows about
you, the better she can blend a scent for you. Astrological 
information is not required, but it is helpful. Kamala may 
ask to smell your arm or your back for an impression of your 
natural body scent, so make sure you are not wearing any 
scents when you come for the consultation.
</p>
<p>
After your consultation, Kamala will take three days to blend 
your personal scent. If you wish to add to your personal scent 
when your tastes change, or even have a second personal scent 
made, Kamala Perfumes, Inc. can do that, too.

<title>Kamala Perfumes, Inc. - Flower Waters</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>
<img src="picts/logotiny.gif" align=middle alt="Kamala Perfumes, Inc.">
Flower Waters </h1>
<p>
Flower waters are the other product of the steam distillation process
which produces essential oils. Flower waters can be used as a summertime 
body or facial splash, as an addition to our lotion, our shampoo, or our
liquid soaps, or added straight to the bath water. They are light
and enjoyable scents to be used with abandon!
<p>
Flower waters come in 4oz bottles for $6 each.
<dl>
<dt><b>Rose Water</b> $6
<dd>Excellent for the face, try using it in milk desserts as well!

<dt><b>Orange Blossom Water</b> (Neroli Water) $6
<dd>A beautiful addition to any of our facial oils, or a luxurious body
splash

<dt><b>Peppermint Water</b> $6
<dd>Very refreshing in the summertime; slightly drying to the skin

<dt><b>Chamomile Wather</b> $6
<dd>Very soothing and relaxing; mix with the appropriate skin oil and
shake vigourously to create an excellent aftershave.

<dt><b>Lavender Water</b> $6
<dd>Another relaxing water; use often on oily skin, eczema, or acne.

<dt><b>Aloe Vera</b> $12
<dd>Ok, it's not a floral water, but it's very healing to the skin for cuts, 
bruises, and especially burns.

<dt><b>Glycerine</b> $5
<dd>Another not-a-floral-water, but it is useful for giving a silky feeling
to any home-made body products, or for limiting the area to which you apply
an essential oil. Simply surround the area with glycerine to keep an essential
oil from spreading to areas where you don't need it.

<A NAME="Introduction">Welcome</A> to ALL CREATURES! Our goal is to help people help themselves <B><I>and</I></B> their animal companions be  healthy...naturally. Here you can learn about and purchase a wide variety of  alternative health care products, holistic services, handmade art pieces,  books and tapes for you and your animals all in one convenient "store."
<P>
All of our products, from pet toys and supplies, and pet food to  nutritional supplements, including joint rehabilitation therapies, are safe, durable and non-toxic, and contain only the finest natural ingredients without by-products, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives, and are cruelty-free. Our arts and crafts are dramatic and humorous animal reproductions. You can even consult privately with our own holistic "win-win" attorney, nutritional consultant and animal behaviorist!
<P>
Our basic <I>nutritional</I> tenets for you and your animal companions are quite simple: You ARE what you eat. Eat and drink only from non-leaded glass like Pyrex (tm). Unless you live in a truly pristine area, upstream from the cattle crossing, drink only filtered or bottled water, preferably distilled. Eat only natural, organically grown foods.
<P>
Do you have any questions or comments regarding  companion animals,  holistic legal or  health care, nutrition or animal behavior?  We would enjoy hearing from you and will try to respond either directly or through our  Newsletter. 
<P>
Keep visiting our store...updated at least monthly, and be certain to check out our Hot Links to related sites and internet tools and search engines. <P>

<A NAME="Introduction">Welcome</A> to ALL CREATURES! Our goal is to help people help themselves <B><I>and</I></B> their animal companions be  healthy...naturally. Here you can learn about and purchase a wide variety of  alternative health care products, holistic services, handmade art pieces,  books and tapes for you and your animals all in one convenient "store."
<P>
All of our products, from pet toys and supplies, and pet food to  nutritional supplements, including joint rehabilitation therapies, are safe, durable and non-toxic, and contain only the finest natural ingredients without by-products, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives, and are cruelty-free. Our arts and crafts are dramatic and humorous animal reproductions. You can even consult privately with our own holistic "win-win" attorney, nutritional consultant and animal behaviorist!
<P>
Our basic <I>nutritional</I> tenets for you and your animal companions are quite simple: You ARE what you eat. Eat and drink only from non-leaded glass like Pyrex (tm). Unless you live in a truly pristine area, upstream from the cattle crossing, drink only filtered or bottled water, preferably distilled. Eat only natural, organically grown foods.
<P>
Do you have any questions or comments regarding  companion animals,  holistic legal or  health care, nutrition or animal behavior?  We would enjoy hearing from you and will try to respond either directly or through our  Newsletter. 
<P>
Keep visiting our store...updated at least monthly, and be certain to check out our Hot Links to related sites and internet tools and search engines. <P>

<a name="intro"><STRONG><I>There is a bridge connecting Heaven and Earth. It is called the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors. Just this side of the Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hills and valleys with lush green grass.
<P>
When a pet dies, the pet goes to this place. There is always food, water and warm spring weather. The old and frail animals are young again. The abandoned animals are again surrounded by friends. Those who are maimed are made whole again. They play the whole day, every day, with each other.
<P>
There is only one thing missing. They are not with their special people who loved them here on Earth. So, each day they run and play until the day comes when one suddenly stops playing and looks up. The nose twitches! The ears perk up! The eyes water! And, suddenly this one pet bolts excitedly away from the other animals!
<P>
Your pet has seen you arrive! And when you meet your special friend again, you take him or her in your arms and embrace. Your face and nose and lips and neck are licked again and again and again.........and you look once more into the soulful eyes of your loving, trusting pet.
<P>
And then, holding each other, you cross the Rainbow Bridge together.......never again to be separated. </I> Anonymous </STRONG>

<a name="whowhy">
<P>
We are proud to offer you a wide variety of the highest quality hand-made memorial urns and ceramic pieces for your animal companions after they leave here for the other side. Painstakingly handmade, each piece takes up to ten hours to hand-paint followed by several hours firing in the kiln. Most contain considerable amounts of 22k gold, silver and platinum; an oriental master caligrapher has also been retained to create writings, symbols and designs that are unique to Eternal Art memorial products.
<P>
Among the artisans at Eternal Art many are physically-challenged, including the chief artist and proprietor, Phyllis Schockner; men and women from the Braille Institute, several veterans groups and various support groups. 
<P>
You may specify exactly how you want your pets piece designed, colors, style, symbols, photograph insert slots or whatever. Pieces are available for human beings as well.   Custom orders take somewhat longer to craft and involve a reasonable additional cost.

<P>Do you know that 98% of all schools in Japan now have computers while only 5% of our United States schools have computers? Japanese kids have to prove computer proficiency to enter the seventh grade! Our government is now in joint venture negotiations with AT&T and other major U.S. corporations for an initial $200 million to begin putting computer lines in all our
schools by the year 2000 to correct this situation!</H4>
<P>
Rather than  purchasing a home computer for up to $3,000.00, our "Baby Bear" sits atop your own existing TV set, at a full cost of only $499! You can now access the Internet, the World Wide Web, print order forms and research, and send/receive E-mail in your own living room with a simple easy-to-use 60 second hook-up.

<P>
Unlimited Internet access is provided by Future-Link at $19.95 monthly, payable by credit card or by check. Baby Bear is a full-peripheral friendly unit and can be upgraded by downloading directly from the Internet and by existing hardware capabilities, unlike the simple "dummy" units now being marketed in stores, which units cannot be upgraded without major hardware modifications.
<P>
You may purchase your unit from All Creatures for <B><I>only $499</I></B>(suggested retail) OR YOU MAY PARTICIPATE as a FutureNet Consultant for an <B><I>additional $195</I></B>. This provides you not only with your own Baby Bear demo unit, but with a tremendous Multi-Level opportunity to market the Baby Bear to your share of a potential 100 million unit sales (buy at wholesale for $375 and sell at your price, or engage and train your own team of Consultants).

Also available right now are infrared spillproof keyboards, wireless fax modems and services such as internet services, web sites, 800 numbers, long-distance phone calling cards and more; for you to add on to or use with your own Baby Bear unit and to market to your clients. Generous monthly commissions and overrides and weekly training bonuses paid down through many levels; this MLM is designed by some of the original innovators of MLM network sales, the actual founders of FutureNet Online, Inc.
<P>
Through its nonprofit sister company <B><I>"Computers For Kids,"</I></B>  When your Baby Bear becomes obsolete and is replaced by the Mama Bear; if you  donate your initial unit to the school of your choice you will receive <B><I>for free </I></B> the Mama Bear upgrade (not available with the "dummy"units of other companies)!<P>
<hr><p>
<B><I>Consultants will receive a minimum of five free live training sessions, telephonically or in your area.

During this past spring and summer, here in Los Angeles, a human set a dog on fire, another hung his dog with a rope, and  many different sets of parents abandoned their newborn babies in trash dumpsters!  In May, a Right-to-Life group picketing outside a family planning clinic approached a yellow school bus carrying grammar school children and held picket signs bearing photographs of dead fetuses up against the bus windows (guess those kindergarten kids will be sure to practice abstinence or safe sex now!), and  the Make-A-Wish-Foundation granted a last wish to a dying teenager to hunt and  kill a Kodiak bear in Alaska. What a life-affirming act for a dying boy!
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>.........OR IS IT THE ANIMALS?</STRONG></CENTER>
During the same time period a mother cat went back inside a burning home five times to save each of her five kittens,  a dog dialed 911 to save his human companion having a seizure, another dog saved the life of his human guardian by bringing water and squeezing a wet rag to moisten the lips of the immobilized heart attack victim, until help finally came days later; and this past weekend a Gorilla rescued a seriously injured 3-year old boy from almost certain death.

<P>
<CENTER>Ohhh, Our Aching Joints and What Can We Do About It</CENTER>
<P>
The word itself comes from the Greek word "arthron" meaning inflammation.  In common usage most health practitioners use the term, "arthritis," to cover the more than 60 different conditions that cause various joint inflammations and degenerative changes.  Arthritis can attack any joint in the body, at any age, and affects both people and animals (dogs more than cats).
<P>
A few of the common types of arthritis are:  Spondylosis - spinal arthritis, Osteoarthritis - the erosion of cartilage (a dense connective tissue which covers the ends of bones at the joints) permits the rough surfaces of the bones to rub together, Hip Dysplasia - pressure on a canine's hip joint remodels the joint itself.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Causes</H3></CENTER>

Arthritis often begins with an injury or infection of a joint.  When such a problem occurs, the body begins a series of reactions to initiate the process of healing.  This includes a short stage of inflammation.  If the inflammation takes longer to dissipate than it should, the problem can become chronic, impairing healing.  
<P>
Current research indicates that free radical stress is often a critical cause of the inflammation associated with arthritis.  Every joint in the body is surrounded by a capsule of synovial fluid which keeps the joint properly lubricated and allows free movement.  Free radicals can build up in the joint capsule and over time can oxidize (rust is the oxidation of iron) the lining of the capsule, the joint cartilage, and surrounding tissues.  
<P>
Free radicals are a natural waste product of cellular metabolism.  When the body is injured in some way, cells are rushed to the afflicted area to help eliminate the noxious agents or damaged tissue.  With all the excess cellular activity, a higher than normal amount of waste products are released.  If the affected area is a joint the free radicals are released into the small, enclosed joint capsule.  In optimal conditions a body's cells produce enough antioxidant enzymes to neutralize free radicals.
<P>
When under stress, however, such as that caused by an injury, free radicals overwhelm the body's anti oxidizing mechanism.  Other causes of antioxidant depletion are: infection, emotional upset, environmental pollution, old age, and inadequate nutrition.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Identifying Arthritis</H3></CENTER>

Arthritis cannot be seen in X-rays until the condition is well-advanced.  Then permanent changes, such as calcium deposits, loss of cartilage and the malformation of the joint itself can be seen.  Fortunately, arthritis can often be recognized and treated before the damage becomes grossly debilitating and permanent.  
<P>

Here's a brief list of symptoms generally associated with arthritis in humans and their animal companions: 
<UL><LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Joint inflammation (swelling, pain, stiffness) not directly associated with an injury</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Stiffness after periods of inactivity, as upon arising in the morning</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Slow recovery from injury</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Creaking, grinding or cracking sounds in joints</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Loss of mobility</LI></UL>

The following are symptoms specific to our four-legged companions:
<UL><LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Slipping, dragging hind quarters, tripping, or excessive sliding on slick floors</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Uneven weight distribution between paws</LI>
<LI>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="Allergy"> Animal Allergy Alert</A> </H2></CENTER>

<P>
Modern society's increasing susceptibility to allergies does not exclude our companion animals.  Though symptoms may manifest in other systems, the skin and coat of your pet are nearly always affected.  In fact, the most frequent cause of skin problems for animals is allergies.
<P>
In a desire to alleviate their companions' pain and anxiety, people sometimes tend to emphasize treating the symptoms in the most expeditious manner, rather than in finding a cure.  Although steroids and anti-histamines often temporarily suppress the itching and scratching associated with allergies, it is not in our animals' best interest to ignore the larger issues of cause and prevention.   The side effects of these drugs and their impact on health should also be considered.
<P>
The holistic approach is to strengthen and desensitize the animal's own immune system so that it no longer overreacts to allergens, such as pollen or, one of the most common, flea bites.  This involves nutritional, emotional, and medical support.  
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>What Can You Do? </H3></CENTER>

Allergy tests can be run to determine what allergens, including foods, affect your companion.  If sensitivities to certain foods, such as beef or corn, show up just delete those items from the animal's diet (including treats).  Your dog or cat's immune system may be under attack with every meal.  You can help your pet overcome almost any kind of allergy by supplying a natural, high-quality diet. 
<P>
Be careful of foods which contain yeast, to which some animals are sensitive.  A healthful diet with a good vitamin/mineral supplement along with food enzymes, acidophilus, garlic and Omega-3 and -6 can be decisive.  Be sure to supply fresh distilled or purified water.  Adding 1/2 teaspoon of chlorophyll per pint of water is also of value.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Hands-On Treatment</H3></CENTER>

For more direct relief of the itching, we find oatmeal based shampoos and conditioners very beneficial for skin with lesions.  To draw toxins out of the body, give your pet Epsom salt soaks (1/2 cup salts per gallon of water) for 15 minutes and rinse.
<P>
Acupressure and acupuncture can be used to gradually help strengthen your pet's immune system and to relieve itching.  You can utilize convenient acupressure points located where the atlas bone makes a noticeable bump right behind and below each ear.  Massage the points, using your left hand, whenever you notice your pet scratching.  In addition to improving the immune system, this usually relieves the itching after several minutes of stimulation.
<P>
Acupuncture treatment has an even stronger, longer-lasting impact.  However, strengthening the immune system internally is the permanent solution.  With the right nutrients your animal will probably be able to build a strong immune system and body, free of allergies and itching.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Desensitization</H3></CENTER>

Desensitization can also be helpful for extreme allergies, or when exposure to the allergen(s) cannot be controlled long enough to allow the animal's immune system to be fortified.  This approach is especially useful for animals allergic to pollen.  Begin adding a tiny quantity of pure, raw (i.e. never heated) bee pollen to food.  As your pet builds up a resistance, gradually increase the amount and eventually he or she should no longer suffer from the allergy.  This natural method has the additional benefit of providing your animal with an excellent food supplement.  It works for people, too.
<P>
One of the most frequent allergies in animals is to flea bites.  Fleas inject saliva into their host whenever they feed.  This saliva is an allergen, and over time, as animals are bitten many times, they can develop an allergic reaction.  There is an injectible flea antigen available, which was first created for people.  Veterinarians have access to it and a series of small injections can be extremely helpful in desensitizing an animal to flea bites.  Fleas have other bothersome and harmful effects, so during flea season, still continue to use non-toxic flea products to rid your pet and home of fleas.
<P>
There really is hope for the allergic animal.  These natural methods have proved themselves innumerable times.  And what a pleasure it is to stroke the lustrous, soft fur and smooth skin of your healthy companion.

<A NAME="INTRO">The exorbitant financial costs of courtroom litigation both to the taxpayers and the litigants, as well as the tremendous emotional drain on the litigants, have clearly established the need for the practice of preventive law. Similar in concept to preventive health care, this has been called the "win-win" approach to legal issues, and a great number of holistic lawyers have come forward to meet this challenge to the justice system as we approach the 21st Century. Of course, many practitioners have pursued this approach for centuries...so, it is not a "new" concept, rather one quite grounded in history.
<P>
After nearly 24 years of both criminal and civil practice in California, the law firm of Sheldon I. Breier and Associates has developed holistic solutions to a variety of legal "entanglements."  The win-win approach has been successfully applied to matters of divorce, child custody, division of property, allocation of spendable income, real property, employment and business contracts as well as criminal matters.

<H2><A NAME="Study2">
Case Study #2 (Fall, 1996)</A> </H2>: After nearly four years of jail, counseling, and counseling of others, a Mother convicted of child abuse under the relatively newly recognized syndrome referred to as Munchausen's By Proxy was punished again when her newborn was seized by Child Services workers when she was only a few hours old.
<P>
The earlier abused child had been permanently placed with her natural father three years earlier, with Mother having only visitation rights (monitored). There was no evidence of any abuse to the new baby or to the Mother herself, which is common in Munchausen cases. 
<P>
Child Services acted on the mere fear, albeit certainly a possibility, the second child would be abused, despite Mother's early admission of guilt and successful therapy history over a long term. For a little background, Munchausen's is a mental disorder, a syndrome whereby one causes oneself to be hospitalized with a wide variety of self-inflicted illnesses and injuries, usually as an attention-getter.
<P>
Munchausen's <B><I> By Proxy </I></B> describes the situation where the adult injures the child instead of themselves, for example by inducing vomiting and other, usually life-endangering, symptoms of sickness, then claiming no knowledge of any cause/effect when the child is (repeatedly) hospitalized.
<P> 
While there are as yet no known cases of rehabilitation on record, such is a distinct possibility when the abuser (1) admits guilt early on, (2) admits full responsibility, and (3) participates in sincere, in-depth long-term counseling.
<P>
Just when this Mother's baby was to be placed in a foster home, with adoption as the ultimate goal, Mother retained Counsel who was able to negotiate an alternative plan: Long-term counseling with a renowned Munchausen expert, placement of the child with longtime personal friends of Mother, 12-hour daily monitored visitations, with the ultimate goal of full reunification. 
<P>
Again, negotiation based on reality, full-disclosure, cooperation and a desire for everyone to win can, and usually does, have outstanding results. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the outlook is bright for everyone, especially Mother and Baby. Even Old Husband and First Child are now regular visitors with Mother and Child and New Husband! I will report on any future developments as they occur.
<P>
<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A><P>
<hr>
<P><H2><A NAME="Study1">Case Study #1</A></H2>: Party A (BUYER) contracted with Party B (SELLER) to purchase an ongoing business operation. The assets of the business were a client list, furnishings and equipment, leasehold improvements, the premises lease, Yellow Page advertising accounts and the telephone numbers listed therein.
<P>
Seller contended that the client list, furnishings and equipment were the only items sold; and that the lease, the Yellow Page advertising accounts and the telephones were just being "subleased" to Buyer. When Buyer disputed the ultimate dollar amounts involved in the transaction, Seller had the telephones disconnected, effectively terminating Buyer's ability to do business. 
<P>
Buyer lost the business, Seller stepped back in to run the business as before, despite having received  a substantial amount of money from Buyer, and while refusing to return any part of it. 
<P>
 There was an agreed price, but the "for what" was never spelled out in writing. So, enough ambiguities existed to cause the sale to become Buyer's personal financial disaster. For example, Seller expected Buyer to payoff her old unpaid telephone bill and Yellow Page monthly charges. Also, Seller expected Buyer to service clients whose fees had already been paid to Seller before the sale.
<P>
When Buyer disputed paying the old unpaid bills, Seller had the phones disconnected. No phones = no new business = business failure. Seller had promised for several weeks to have the accounts (phones, lease and Yellow Pages) changed into Buyer's name, without ever so doing. 
<P>

There seems to be strong evidence that this is Seller's recurring "modus operandi." She never transferred the esential accounts into the Buyer's name. She never informed the lessor there was to be a new lessee in the premises. 
<P>
She left several unpaid past due business and personal debts, including personal long-distance phone call charges. She left several clients who had paid in full for a series of truly personal services in advance, without informing any of them of the sale, and without offering refunds. 
<P>
She attempted to force the Buyer to honor these contracts without any  compensation. She attempted to have the phone company refer all calls to the therapy office of her relative here in Los Angeles, after having them cutoff to the Buyer. She is suing Buyer for nonexistent damages in excess of $5,000.00. 
<P>
She moved out of state,  left no forwarding address or phone number. Her husband just graduated from law school and is "itching" to litigate EVERYTHING while he studies for the Bar Exam! 
<P>
Bottom line: She files suit here in Los Angeles but cannot be served in any counter-suit, even though the Buyer's claims are stronger and are more truthful,  BECAUSE SHE CANNOT BE FOUND! Not without incurring very costly investigative resources out of state.
<P>
The short answer is: <STRONG>PUT EVERYTHING IN WRITING!</STRONG> EVERYTHING! No matter if (1) you're "in a hurry," (2) you "know, love and trust each other," (3) you're "old friends," or (4) "it's only a little (business, issue, problem, song, short story, screenplay, invention, idea, concept, etc) project," or whatever.
<P> 
If the other party will not agree to a written contract, signed by all parties, <B><I>before</I></B> any exchange of money or goods or services, then something is VERY, VERY WRONG! List every single item that is involved, its price or value...and what each party is agreeing to do, give up or pay for that particular item.

Maureen Hall's horses, dogs, macaw parrots, goats and performing chickens are seen in motion pictures, television shows and commercials. She has performed over 5,000 live shows with her trained animals, emphasizing the intelligence of the animal and allowing the animal to perform only those abilities it truly enjoys.
<P>
Her career began some years ago as a rider and trainer of Western, English and Dressage horses. As part of her study of the needs and emotions of all species, Maureen worked three years as a certified zoo manager. Treating all animals with respect and compassion is Maureen's <B><I>Number One Priority.</I></B>
<P>
Appearing on radio and television in Australia, on "Extraordinary People," and travelling around the globe with her Andalusian stallion, they have put on very special exhibitions. Together they have demonstrated the ultimate partnership of mutual respect, love and complete trust as they perform stage and movie tricks and classical dressage without bridle or saddle.
<P>
You may have seen Maureen on The Marilu Henner Show, the KTLA Morning News, "Hidden Mysteries Of The Mind," or on one of several other shows, where she discussed telepathic communication with and the intelligence of animals. For example, Maureen, a Black Lab named Cinder and Cinder's human guardian, a severe diabetic. Maureen and Cinder's guardian have taught Cinder to awaken her whenever her blood sugar is too low or too high!<P>
<hr>
<P>
Maureen is available for consultation by phone, fax or "snail mail" with regard to behavior, training and telepathic communication for and with all species. This will involve development of problem solving techniques and effective communication between you and your animal companion. You will begin to better understand your animal's emotions, capabilities and the reasons he or she behaves and thinks the way he or she does. The things you discover, without exaggeration, will most assuredly astound you.
<P>
You will learn that your animal really wants to please you, but that he or she must truly understand what you expect. Animals generally exhibit undesirable behavior because they are confused. They have difficulty understanding the social structure and needs of humans. As you may have noticed, we humans have the same problem.<P>

<P>
There is more than ample scientific evidence that proper nutrition enhances your companion animals' health, performance and longevity.  Over-processing and chemical additives destroy much of the nutritional value of companion animal, and human, foods.
<P>
FLINT RIVER RANCH SUPER PREMIUM HEALTH FOOD FOR PETS is formulated to help your companion animal heal holistically through proper balanced nutrition., and has been called "the next best thing to home-cooked meals."
<P>
Benefits initially noticed are a healthier shiny coat, healthy skin and a higher energy level. Our all- natural ingredients also have a positive effect on allergic reactions, dental disease, degenerative organ disfunction, and feline urological syndrome (F.U.S.), often caused or enhanced by low- quality ingredients and chemicals.
<P>
<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><P>
<HR>
<P>
<a name="ingred">
<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif"> CHICKEN MEAL - The chicken we use is strictly human quality chicken flesh and edible skin, the same as you would serve your family.  Our chicken meal, and other meat ingredients, do not contain ANY by-products such as feet, heads, beaks, feathers, hides, hoofs, intestines, as are commonly found in many so-called "quality" pet foods.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif"> BEET PULP - Beet pulp <B>(after the sugar has been extracted)</B> is by far the best source of fiber for companion animals.  It does a much better, and safer, job of moving the nutrients through the digestive system and assisting in stool formation. Compare this with the peanut hulls, cottonseed, corn cobs, citrus pulp, noxious weeds, straw and other fillers often used in other "qaulity" pet foods.
<P>
<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif"> WHEAT BASE -   Utilizing a <STRONG>combination</STRONG> of various grains, such as ground wheat, wheat flour, wheat germ meal and ground rice, is much healthier than using only a single type of grain. Wheat is far easier to digest than corn or soybean, even though some animals, and humans, may be allergic.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif"> PRESERVATIVES - Food spoils without some form of temperature control or the use of preservatives.  Chemical preservatives are NOT acceptable at Flint River Ranch. We use, instead, only natural Vitamin E in a fat-soluble compound known as Tocopherol, which works just fine as a preservative for up to twelve months ("peak" preservation for up to six months).  Vitamin E is also an anti-oxidant that retards the oxidation of other vitamins in our food.  If necessary, our food may be frozen to preserve freshness.

<a name="dogs">
<STRONG><I>SUPER PREMIUM HEALTH FOOD FOR DOGS</I></STRONG>
<P>
Our food is double-baked as biscuits, then broken into pieces ( rather than the commonly used extrusion [machine-pressed bite-size kibbles] method of cooking,  with the spraying on of liver, grease, and sugar for flavoring).  The resultant natural baked-in flavor is highly palatable and digestible. 
<P>
Your dog will produce lower stool volume, as more of our product is digestible than other brands. Our recent studies reveal that up to four times as much "economy brand" dog food have to be fed your dog than our food.  So, while initial outlay may appear more costly, the reverse in obviously true within a few weeks.
<P>
Please note that there is no need to avoid yeast UNLESS your pet has been diagnosed by a veterinarian as "yeast intolerant" or if your pet has a yeast infection.

<a name="cats">
<STRONG><I>SUPER PREMIUM HEALTH FOOD FOR CATS</I></STRONG>
<P>
The most important ingredient in a cat's diet is PROTEIN. The essential amino acids provided by our Chicken and Lamb Meal are the basic building blocks of muscle, skin, coat, bone, blood and the immune system. TAURINE is especially important for the health of your cat's eyes, heart, nervous and reproductive systems.  We guarantee protein analysis of not less than 32%!
<P>
There is little doubt that feline urological syndrome (F.U.S.) is directly related to the cat's diet and lifestyle.  Low ash and magnesium promote low urinary pH and can help prevent F.U.S.. Our Feline Formula has less than 5.5% ash content and less than 0.095% magnesium content.
<P>
Please note there is no need to avoid yeast UNLESS your pet has been diagnosed by a veterinarian as "yeast intolerant" or if your pet has a yeast infection.

<P>
For those oversize guys and gals you are invited to visit our <A HREF="bigtall.htm"> Big Tall And Portly Shop </A> "just next door."

<a name="intro">
Our team of scientific researchers (shown below) have tested dozens of products for the so-called<B><I>"forgotten dog"</I></B> over  the years. You know, the dog whose Doggie-Door also allows access to full-grown burglars and bobcats. The dog you can barely squeeze into  anything smaller than a Range Rover.
<P>
The dog that can't eat from a bowl on the ground. The dog whose Christmas chewy toy is gone before breakfast.  The dog everyone asks whether it's a pony. The dog people wonder how much it costs to feed. The dog whose Poopie-Dooley is the size of an Exxon tanker. The dog about whom your friends ask: "Where's the bridle and the saddle?" Yes, <I>that dog.</I>
<P>
We're dealing here with Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds, Mastiffs, St. Bernards, Great Pyrenees, Newfoundlands as well as many oversize Dobermans and German Shepherds. Because of their size, strength and weight, these breeds have very special needs that require very special attention. 
<P>
For example, unless their food and water bowls are raised enough off the ground to allow them to eat and drink without lowering their head, and thereby partially shutting off their throats, they <B>WILL</B> suffer many negative  consequences, sooner or later: gas, indigestion, GDV (known as "the bloat" or "flipped stomach"), megaesophagus as well as the steady worsening of arthritis and hip dysplasia, among other problems.
<P>
With regard to toys it is absolutely essential not to use toys containing arsenic (from the animal tanning process, such as rawhide "bones"), artificial flavors or other chemical additives. All the toys we offer here in the Big Tall And Portly Shop, as with all our toys offered for normal size animals in our <A HREF="petsuply.htm">Pet Supplies</A> shop are safe and non-toxic.
<P>
For these "big guys" and "big girls" our toys are especially long-lasting and well-made, so you can be well-assured of their safety. From time to time, as newer items are tested by our Research Committee, we will add additional products for your consideration. <P><B><I>We strongly recommend against the use of any natural or rawhide bones and also against the use of plastic, aluminum or pottery bowls and dishes</I></B>.

<H2><CENTER><A NAME="intro">What Is The True Goal Of Holistic Health Care?</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>
A healthy animal does not get sick except in extreme circumstances.  An animal who eats well, in a safe non-toxic environment (which includes clean bowls and dishes and a fresh clean water source), receives the proper nutrients, whose immune system is strong and who has not been poisoned by toxic substances, will rarely be ill, and will tend to heal rapidly when sick or injured. While holistic health care does treat the sick and injured, its primary benefit is the improvement and maintenance of an animal's own state of good health and well-beingness.  
<P>
We strongly urge you to avoid rawhide bones (contains arsenic from the animal hide tanning process) and any pet food containing any by-products or chemical additives (see our own <A HREF="flintrr.htm"> Flint River Ranch </A> products). Use non-lead glass bowls rather than plastic, ceramic or metal. Use bottled or distilled water.
<P>Here are our products, which we have found beneficial in reaching that goal.  We use only natural products since we don't believe synthetically derived materials provide the bioavailable nutrients living beings need.  We guarantee you and your pet's satisfaction, or your money back.  Full information and instructions for products included with order.

<P><STRONG><I>VAC RELIEF</I></STRONG>
<P>
A homeopathic remedy combination to combat toxic effects from standard vaccination injections.   Numerous reports and articles by scientists and practicing veterinarians have pointed out the potential  negative aspects of vaccination for a number of animals so innoculated.  
<P>
These includes skin problems, seizures, bloat, arthritis (particularly of the spine),  chronic gastroenteritis, immune system dysfunction, the actual disease vaccinated against, and even death.  If you have noticed any problems following vaccinations of your animal companions this may be the solution.  You administer these homeopathic remedies for one month, morning and evening.

<P><STRONG><I>"GENUINE" FOOD ENZYMES POWDER </I></STRONG>
<P>
Needed for efficient digestion and nutrient absorption of processed, cooked foods.  Contains all the main food enzymes: amylase, protease, lipase, cellulase and maltase in highly concentrated form.  Raw food contains the enzymes needed for digestion, but heating food destroys all these and the body is forced to produce them itself in order to digest food, depleting the body's limited enzyme capacity. 
<P>
 Having sufficient food enzymes can make a major improvement in health and longevity.  This powder replaces enzymes absent from the processed food most of us give our animal companions.  Highly concentrated formula means you only need to use 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon per meal, depending on amount of food.

<STRONG><I>DISMUTASE</I></STRONG>
<P>
Free radical stress plays a critical role in a wide range of conditions, especially those involving inflamation, such as arthritic conditions, strains, accidental or surgical traumas.  Superoxide dismutase relieves the enzyme deficiencies which play a part in these conditions, as well as those which are part of pharmacological side effects and reactions to environmental toxins.  
<P>
Adequate antioxidant enzyme levels are reflected in overall health, vitality, and stamina.  Regular supplementation with Dismutase helps to insure adequate antioxidant enzyme levels.   Most dogs will eat the tablets as treats.  For cats and dogs who won't, they can be crumbled and mixed with food. 400 MG tablets.

<STRONG><I>ERIGERON FLEA BANE SPRAY</I></STRONG>
<P>
Erigeron is also known as Canadian Fleabane and is a herb with healing qualities in addition to its effective flea deterrence.  It does not have the strong pungent odor many natural flea repellents have, which often are offensive to the sensitive noses of dogs and cats.  This is the finest natural flea control available.  
<P>
Topically, Erigeron repells insects, especially fleas, and it also helps heal hot spots.  Then, when the animal licks itself and ingests the herb while grooming, Erigeron is an aid in digestion.  The other ingredients in this Flea Bane Spray are Aloe Vera for healing and soothing, along with fruit and nut oils to lubricate and comfort skin.  
<P>
This spray really works, is beneficial for your animal companions, and is absolutely nontoxic for both them and you.  Use once a day for a slight flea problem and twice a day for flea infestation.

<p font size=4><b> Dogs suffering with joint diseases such as arthritis, bursitis,

osteochondrosis (OCD), hip dysplasia and other degenerative problems with

the shoulders, elbows and hocks can now experience immediate and long-term

relief without drugs. Veterinarians no longer need to give pet owners,

suffering along with their animals, the frustrating news that nothing much

can be done.

</p><br>

<p font size=4><b> WINSTON'S JOINT FORMULA is a combination of three, totally-natural whole

food supplements developed by a Naturopathic Doctor for his own dog. No

drugs.  No side-effects because it's all just good whole food. No dosage

problems because the body uses only what it needs. And now, with the

addition of freeze-dried shark cartilage, the formula is showing results

that are even more remarkable.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> When paired with our collagen compound, a daily dose of this joint formula

provides many of the raw materials essential for the synthesis of the

joint-lubricating synovial fluid as well as articular cartilage and

connective tissue.  We include, in Winston's Formula, a natural

anti-inflammatory compound, long used to relieve the pain of arthritis.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> Within the first 30 days of treatment, dogs on WINSTON'S JOINT FORMULA show

noticeable and often remarkable improvement. And, unlike the drugs used to

give temporary relief, IT CAN'T HURT. <br><br>

<p font size=4><b> WINSTON'S JOINT FORMULA is a natural , drug-free remedy that seems to

provide relief for nearly all joint problems, --arthritis, hip dysplasia,

elbow and shoulder osteochondrosis (OCD), ankle joint problems, and growing

pains.  It is a combination of three, totally-natural whole food

supplements, initially prescribed to heal the shoulder problem of Winston's

owner!  That's me -- and my shoulder got so much better, so fast, that I

asked my Naturopathic Doctor if this might work as well on Winston.

Obviously, the answer was "yes."   It took a lot of research and testing but

now, we have developed a combination that seems to work wonders, provides

some immediate relief, and may actually reverse some of the joint damage.

No drugs.  No painkillers. No steroids.  No side-effects because it's all

just good whole food.  No dosage problems because the body uses only what it

needs.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> WINSTON is a 12-year-old Springer Spaniel who had lost a lot of his

"spring."   Four years ago he was operated on for OCD bone chips in his

elbow, and then three years ago, his X-rays showed moderate hip dysplasia.

Then, his suffering had increased so that, there were periods when he cried

every morning when he tried to get up out of bed.  Once or twice a week he

would refuse to get up at all.  Many walks were in slow motion and he always

needed help with stairs and getting into the car.  

<br>

<p font size=4><b> After the first week or two of feeding Winston this formula, the complaining

stopped.  After the first month, he only complained once about getting up

(after a day of strenuous activity that made me moan in the morning too).

He has a whole new gait.  The "spring" is back in his step. The results were

so immediate, the relief so obvious, that I started giving out "Winston's

Formula" to other dog owners. They reported similar results.  I contacted

another well-known, well-respected Naturopathic Doctor for another opinion,

even though I knew I wasn't imagining this.  I was delighted to find an

enthusiastic supporter who said he cured his 15-year-old Giant Schnauzer of

arthritis with a similar treatment. (His statement is included)  His

recommendation was essentially the same, and we refined the combination

further.  Here's what we have to offer the tens of thousands of animals

<p font size=4><b> WINSTON'S JOINT  REMEDY is a combination of safe, effective compounds. For

decades they have been carefully processed for human use, and now they are

combined into the most effective joint remedy I've ever seen  -- totally

natural, whole food supplements, developed to treat human joint and bone

disorders. Specifically, our compounds work synergistically to greatly

reduce pain and inflammation. Theoretically, they build collagen and

articular cartilage, strengthen ligaments and revitalize the

joint-lubricating synovial fluid.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> PART #1: Cartilage and Bone Rebuilder, Without Spurious Deposits

Current medical literature contains much clinical evidence that shark

cartilage is a tremendously effective treatment in many degenerative and

inflammatory conditions.  We use it to try and provide the building blocks

required by the body to repair its own articular cartilage and reverse the

deterioration of connective tissue.  It's entirely possible that this

lyophilized, freeze-dried shark cartilage also strengthens ligaments for

proper joint positioning while it keeps calcium in elemental form so that

bone spurs don't occur as hard deposits in the joint.



<br>

<p font size=4><b> PART #2: Boost The Joint Lube & Strengthen the Ligaments.

The joint capsule is filled with synovial fluid, composed of nutrients which

diffuse into the joint from the blood supply.  It's job is to lubricate the

joint and prevent erosion of articular cartilage.  Winston's Formula

supplies components that could be critical to preventing free radicals and

enzymes from white blood cells from attacking the articular cartilage. This

is a collagen complex that supplies some of the raw materials needed for

growth and repair.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> PART #3:  Down With Inflammation!

Introduced for human consumption decades ago and recognized for its relief

of arthritic symptoms, this formulation works particularly well in concert

with the other compounds due to absorbability, digestive factors and

synergistic effects. Based on bromelaine (pineapple enzyme) with lots of

absorbable vitamin C which figures prominently in the biosynthesis of Type I

collagen -- the important structural protein that appears most often in

connective tissue, bone and ligaments.  This is a natural anti-inflammatory

that can provide immediate relief without the harmful side-effects of

steroid shots or other drugs.<br>



<p font size=4><b> PART #4:  Accupressure Massage

For hip dysplasia or other hindquarters problems, it helps to "switch on"

the muscles in the hindquarters by slow, deep massage with your fingertips

on both sides of your dog's spine, along the last 3 or 4 vertebrae, all the

way to the base of the tail.  Massage firmly enough to get a reaction from

your dog. Two minutes or so seems to make a big difference.<br>



<p font size=4><b> I wrap each pill in a thin slice of cheese -- small enough that Winston can

gulp it without chewing and discovering what's hidden in the middle.  It's

important that you continue the treatment each and every day, even after you

notice considerable improvement.  This type of treatment is more gradual,

gentle and natural than a quick shot of some drug or painkiller.  The

benefits of WINSTON'S JOINT  remedy are cumulative.  Again, since we are

only dealing with natural foods here, there is no danger in long-term use.

I kept Winston on "one-a-day" for three months or so, and then cut back to a

maintenance level of every other day, or every third day.  I'll do it for

the rest of his life.  I know he'll never be "cured", but he certainly has

"healed".  He and other dogs like him can be a lot more comfortable and free

of potentially harmful drugs.  <br><br>

<blockquote>

<p font size=4><b> The Doctor's Statement:

"I have reviewed "Winston's Joint Formula" regarding its effectiveness with

arthritis, bursitis, hip dysplasia, and other joint disorders.  I have come

to the following conclusions:

 

 <p font size=4><b> For more than 18 years as a professional Nutritionist, I have worked with

these and many similar natural whole food compounds, for the purpose of

providing health without drugs. The products used in "Winston's Formula"

have been sold for human consumption for over 30 years. My experience over

the last 18 years of clinical trials is that most formulas and ingredient

sources do not take into account absorbability factors, digestive factors

and synergistic factors.  These are some of the factors that contribute to

the unusual effectiveness of "Winston's Joint Formula".

<br>

<p font size=4><b> The symptoms of pain, discomfort and lack of mobility stem from

inflammation, bone spurs, ligament problems and articular cartilage

degeneration.  "Winston's Joint Formula" specifically targets these

problems.  The alternatives to these natural remedies are sometimes as

devastating as the problems themselves. Commonly injected steroids have

anti-inflammatory effects, yet, adversely affect other systems of the body

and actually reduce absorption of many elements necessary to build or heal

joints.  

<br>

<p font size=4><b> In contrast, the worst possible effect from "Winston's Joint Formula" is

that your animal will get a little additional nutrition. After my

experience, working with clients' animals, (and with my own 15-year-old

Giant Schnauzer), my professional evaluation of  "Winston's Joint Formula"

is that it most certainly addresses issues of inflammation, soft tissue

damage, bursitis, hard tissue damage (ligaments, cartilage  and bone).  It

will greatly aid the overall symptoms affecting the animal's demeanor and

mobility.  Additionally, as the animals become more normally active and

inflammation is reduced, the body has a better chance to heal itself."

<hr>



<p font size=4><b> WINSTON'S JOINT FORMULA works like all naturopathic remedies -- the body can

heal itself when it is supplied with potent, natural compounds in a balanced

nutritional program.  This makes it possible, as scientists know, for the

skeleton to actually regenerate itself.

<br>

<p font size=4><b> A spokesman at the Orthopaedic Foundation for Animals based at the

University of Missouri says they will be following our further testing with

interest.  An independent panel of veterinarians is testing WINSTON'S

FORMULA on a wide range of breeds. And, while all this evidence is what the

drug manufacturers call "anecdotal", we are trying to initiate a major

clinical testing program with the University of California at Davis School

of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery.  That kind of proof takes time and

money.  But if you could have seen Winston before and after this treatment,

you'd have all the "proof" you needed!

<br>

<p font size=4><b> WINSTON'S JOINT formula has certainly provided rapid relief of pain and

discomfort for many dogs so far, and long-term analysis of X-rays is

expected to show improvements in the overall health of the joint as well.

Our motto, and reason for using only pure, totally natural whole food

supplements as remedies, is, "IT CAN'T HURT"...and it sure seems to work well.

<font size=4><I> A Note From Sam Friedman:</I></font><br>

<p font size=3>

   This product has really been especially helpful for working and

hunting dogs since they are so active. Our most recent endorsements:<P>  


<STRONG><I>"Our dog Zane's hocks are very bad which I first noticed when he turned six months of age. His rear legs were so close together that he looked as if he had only one rear leg.<P>
I started using Winston's Formula when he turned 7 months old and after only 5 days, he began walking more normally, and after 2 months he was a completely new dog. I now give him the Formula twice a day which he will stay on for the rest of his life."</I><P>
E. Sobolewski, Etowah, NC</STRONG><P>

<STRONG><I>"Our lab "Ollie" was diagnosed with OCD at two years of age and had both hocks operated on. After we started using Winston's Joint Formula, his stiffness diminished significantly and he now plays and runs with our other dogs with much greater ease. His skin and coat have also greatly improved.<P>
I will continue to use your product. Thanks so much."</I><P>
D. Koser-Smith, Oregon City, OR</STRONG><P>

<B><I>Thank you for bringing Winston's Joint Formula to the world!  Our six year
old Maltese, Mindy, was diagnosed with dysplastic hips last year.  She was
in pain, lethargic, and constantly held her right leg in the air.  We
wanted an alternative to surgery and anaesthesia; we also wanted something
natural, and not animal tested. We decided your product was worth a try,
and within three weeks, she was walking normally again. She's happy and she
can run and play again.  Thanks ever so much.

P.S.   We originally were going to try "cosequin" at our vets
recommendation, after reading 		          their pamplet, I threw the
bottle away.</I><p>

<B><I>We just wanted to let you know how fantastic Winstons Joint Formula worked
for our little dog. At six months old, we were told by our vet that Blanche
would never live a normal life because of severe hip dysplasia which was
advanced beyond her young age. We were absolutely devastated because she
could barely walk and could not walk up the stairs. With this bad news from
the vet, we had no idea what to do.
<P>
A good friend told us about your product and we immediately gave it a try.
Following your directions for dosage, we put Blanche on the formula. The
results were amazing. Within three days she showed signs of improvement
such as reduced pain and some greater flexibility. By the one week point,
our little dog was running, jumping and literally flying off the sofa. She
was in essence, fully back to normal and has remained as such since March
of 1996.
<P>
What more can I say? Your product really works!! Please feel free to offer
my words of support to anyone who is considering using your formula for
their dog.</I><P>

<STRONG><I>EDITOR'S NOTE: Our dog, Sampson, a 2 year old Great Dane, <center><IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC="samson.jpg"></IMG></center>tested Winston's Joint Formula this past two months with obvious positive results. He came to us from an animal shelter with a grotesque hip deformity, which we were never able to determine as congenital or the result of an injury; that he was experiencing pain and difficulty getting up and running was quite clear.<P>
We noticed greater mobility within 3 weeks, his vet noticed improvement within a month, and his chiropractor confirmed major improvement after 2 months. That is why we here at All Creatures now offer you this outstanding product.</I></STRONG></P>


We believe that surgery, invasive procedures and loading

these suffering animals with drugs is wrong if it can in anyway be avoided. The

bottom line is that healing joint problems naturally is much less expensive

than the vet and it doesn't bother the dogs in the slightest. And they even

get some additional nutrition in the bargain.<br>



People tell us that "Winston's Formula" sounds almost too good to be true,

but the fact is, that when it works (which is a fairly good percentage of

the time), the results are pretty miraculous.  It doesn't work in each and

every situation, mainly because of the huge number of different joint

problems and also because some dogs are so far deteriorated that nothing

would help them, but I think we have a very good track record thus far.  

<br>

The product works best for joint and hip problems - for advanced

arthritis it seems to relieve some of the pain and inflammation in

those cases too.  If the problem isn't healed, many dogs at least seem to

get around much better because the pain is lessened and the inflammation

goes down.  The younger the dog, the better chance for the body to heal itself.

We have always had an interest in striving for good health through proper nutrition from
the foods we eat, and also through the use of a few basic nutritional supplements.  It has
just been in the past few years that we came to the realization that if we truly wanted
optimum health we needed to make a quantum leap in nutrition awareness and expand our
knowledge and understanding of proper supplementation.  After thorough research, we made a
conscientious family decision to use a proven original T.J. Clark colloidal mineral formula
and centered our business around it.
<p>
<center><font size=+2>It's been 70 years since the introduction of<br>Natural Colloidal
Minerals!</font></center>
<p>
<font size=+1>A history making discovery!</font>
<br>
<img align=right src="ripind.gif" alt="*" width="153" height="149">
For hundreds of years before the white man came, the Piute Indians of Central Utah
journeyed to a legendary sacred spring known for its extraordinary healing powers.
<p>
In 1920 an ailing rancher named Thomas Clark was led to this same spring by one of the few
remaining Indian elders.  Soon after drinking the water he underwent an amazing recovery.
Encouraged by this result he became determined to unlock the secret of this mysterious
healing spring.
<p>
As he followed the spring back into the surrounding mountains he came upon a deposit of
unusual appearing material, which the spring water was flowing through.  It was later
determined to be the elemental remains of an ancient rain forest, uniquely encapsulated and
preserved in their original plant form for over 100 million years.
<p>
When this material was analyzed, it was found to contain a startling spectrum of over 70
different minerals and rare colloidal trace minerals.  After months of experimentation he
developed a leaching process to extract and concentrate these minerals and began passing
the <a href="ripple.htm">"miracle liquid"</a> out to his friends and neighbors.  Some of
the letters he received were truly remarkable and by word of mouth only, its use began to
spread across the country and into several foreign countries.
<p>
Tom Clark II, in his fascination with the product, did further research to determine why
the product produced such dramatic effects on people's health.  He believed the product had
unusual electrical properties.  This was later confirmed by a special electronic wavelength
test done by Dr. Fritx-Albert Popp, one of Germany's foremost biophysicists. The minerals
had a natural negative charge, known as colloidal bioactive minerals.
<p>
This time honored tradition is now carried on by the 3rd generation of the T.J. Clark
family.  Today tens of thousands of people all over the world are enjoying the benefits of
this legendary all natural product.
<p>
Ripple Creek Enterprises cares about you.  Our whole focus is centered around offering you
the highest standards in quality, affordable product, enjoined with outstanding customer
service.  We <i>really</i> do care.

<center><H4><B>INTRODUCTORY PAGE</B></H4></center><P>
Brought to you by All Creatures and Awareness Corporation, the Clear(tm) herbal parasite cleansing system is both gentle and extremely effective! Are you aware that over 95% of people in the United States have parasites in their body? Are you aware they invade not only the large and small colon, but also every organ in the body? Are you aware they are believed by many health-care professionals to be one of the causes, or THE cause, for many diseases and disorders, including Diabetes and Epilepsy? 
<P>
They are the beings that get to your nutrients before your body can use them. Are you aware you can kill those little suckers and get rid of them once and for all without the need for extensive long-term colonic therapy? This discussion may seem disgusting to you, but the reality of parasites in your body right now is even more disgusting.
<P><hr><P>
Even if you're NOT aware of these facts, even if you believe only people in Third World nations suffer from parasites, they are still in every part of your body, little white one-inch pinworms, 35 foot or longer tapeworms, spider worms, and many many more! If you've EVER eaten undercooked beef, pork, poultry or lamb, if you've ever eaten rare meat or Steak Tartare, if you've ever eaten Sushi, if you've ever petted your dog or cat, if you've ever eaten fresh fruit or vegetables.........YOU HAVE WORMS IN YOUR BODY RIGHT NOW! No matter how long ago you were exposed, no matter whether you show any symptoms of any kind.
<P><hr><P>
We at All Creatures, as you know, test every product we offer for a substantial period of time before we agree to sell them to our clients here online. Suffice to say, we and our cats and dogs have been on Clear for nearly two months and feel absolutely terrific. The All Creatures animals look better, walk better, smell better, and have shinier coats and better appetites. It also appears they have no aches or stomach or gas pains; they are passing air much less and it no longer smells as bad.
<P><hr><P>
We All Creatures humans feel better and have better skin color. We are no longer experiencing vague pain in the lower abdomen, cramping in the upper thighs or extreme exhaustion and fatigue. My insulin usage has dropped from 90 units daily to under 40, and my blood pressure has been in the normal range for the first time in three years. My workday has grown from under four hours to a range of from 8 to 12 hours without any inner or outward signs of loss of focus or mental clarity. Our digestion is also better with no noticable heartburn, nausea, gas or flatulence, constipation or diarrhea. Do any of these symptoms sound familiar?

It is formulated with specific nutrients for the skin to help maintain its youthful radiance and healthy appearance.  By providing these valuable nutrients, Forever Young helps support natural beauty from within.

Most people experience positive results in 90 days or less.  We suggest you take a close-up photo of your face and hands before you begin and then again in three months to help you realize the full effect of the improvement.  By taking one tablet twice a day you can insure that your skin receives many important nutrients valuable for revitalizing and preserving youthful skin.

<STRONG><I>SYNERGY PAK</I></STRONG>
<P>
"I know I should be taking some kind of vitamins, but what should I take?"  Thousands of people have asked that question.  We all know nutritional health is important, but where do we start?  We all need a beginning.  Synergy Pak makes that beginning simple, easy and cost effective.  It contains a 30 day supply of four basic products to get you started and help keep you going:
<P>
<IMAGE WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif">  TVM-29 is a broad spectrum supplement to insure the Recommended Daily Allowance of most vitamins and minerals.  
<P>
<IMAGE WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif">Sustenase provides enzymes to support the digestive process in the stomach and intestinal tract to break down the foods we eat and better absorb and utilize their nutrients.  
<P>
<IMAGE WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif">Colodyne contains fiber and special ingredients such as L-Salivarius and other micro-flora, herbs and enzymes that support healthy bowel hygiene and ecology.  
<P>
<IMAGE WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14 SRC="balbulet.gif">Protex Plus provides anti-oxidants, immune system support and anti-aging supplements important today as protector nutrients against environmental and other contaminants.  
<P>
The Synergy Pak includes a cassette tape loaded with nutritional information to help you for years to come.  Just follow the simple instructions and start to live your new, healthier life.  
<P>

<STRONG>30 Day Supply			$70.00		Product JP-2</STRONG>	
<P>

<STRONG><I>SALIVAREX</I></STRONG>
<P>
This is a new dimension of micro-flora supplementation.  Containing 275 mg of stabilized L-Salivarius bio-culture, each capsule provides a minimum of 2.75 billion micro-organisms in a buffered and stabilized base with synergistic bacteria from L-Acidophilus, L-Bulgaricus, L-Bifidus and Streptococcus Faecium plus Lysozyme.  Lysozyme is a natural constituent of virtually all body fluids and is one of our natural defenses against harmful bacteria and viruses.  
<P>
This combination helps maintain healthy bowel ecology and controls invading bacteria and yeast.  Low levels of flora can result in such symptoms as bad breath, cold sores, constipation, diarrhea, toxemia, vaginitis, yeast infections, chronic infections and low levels of energy.  Our natural flora levels can become dangerously low from several factors, such as taking antibiotics (Remember, many feed animals are treated with antibiotics, which are then passed on to the consumers of meat, egg and dairy products.), drinking chlorinated water and alcohol, faulty diets and others.  
<P>
Also, many beneficial bacteria are lost by the normal process of elimination and can be replenished quickly by supplementing with Salivarex.   How many capsules a day you should take is based on your needs; if you use antibiotics or any of the other sources of flora destruction, balance the loss with this source of replacement.  You will receive an informative brochure to explain the important features and benefits of this recently developed digestive supplement.
<P>
<STRONG>90 Capsules		$45.00		Product JP-3</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG><I>LIFE-N-POWER</I></STRONG>
<P>
Originally, Life-N-Power was designed for athletes such as body builders and weight lifters to provide almost immediate, and yet sustained, energy.  Vitamin B-12 and its co-enzyme Dibencozide is included because it facilitates the conversion of fat to lean body mass.   
<P>
Now, thousands are using Life-N-Power to sustain energy and help level out the "blahs" that result from dramatic blood sugar level changes, as well as, to support energy and body development.  Many people experience drastic changes in blood sugar levels, almost from moment to moment.  Although complex carbohydrates are worthwhile in our diets, the continual ingestion of simple carbohydrates (sugars and refined carbohydrates) sensitize the pancreas to either under-produce or over-produce insulin, resulting in stress to most organs of the body.  
<P>
Life-N-Power contains Malto Dextrin, Sorbitol and Mannitol as sources of carbohydrate that are utilized more slowly than simple sugars, but do not require the longer periods of digestion of more complex carbohydrates.  It provides more instant energy yet avoids overloads of a large amount of sugar at one time.  It is a good-tasting lozenge that is dissolved and absorbed in the mouth.

<STRONG><I>SOY MIRACLE</I></STRONG> 
<P>
That's what is seems like sometimes.  Hundreds of research reports indicate that soybean products are beneficial in:  substantially reducing cholesterol, protecting against heart disease, reducing the risk of cancer, blocking the development of cancer at several stages, minimizing the effects of PMS and menopause, treating leukemia, boosting the immune system and fortifying bones against osteoporosis.  
<P>
Studies continue as researchers seek the active components that seem to make soy protein so beneficial.  Recent discoveries point to a range of phytochemicals found in soybeans.  Newsweek reported that, "Just a few years ago, scientists didn't know phytochemicals existed.  But today they are the new frontier in cancer-prevention research... They work by waking up enzymes inside cells which detoxify cancer-causing chemicals." (4/25/94)  Other important soybean plant chemicals include, protease inhibitors, phytate, phytosterols, saponins, phenolic acids, lecithin and omega-3 fatty acids.
<P>
<STRONG><I>SOY MIRACLE ULTIMATE SHAKE</I></STRONG>

This is the world's first soy-activated premium grape seed extract with Green Tea.  It contains a proprietary blend of pycnogenols from purified Japanese Grape Seed Extract and phosphatidylcholine (PC) derived from the soybean.  Recent research suggests that, when combined with PC, the biological activity of pycnogenol may be increased up to three fold.  
<P>
This Japanese Grape Seed Extract has certified 100% potency, not the 85% to 92% found in other pine bark and grape seed products, and is the only one not extracted with harsh solvents.  Studies of the health benefits of Green Tea indicate that it strengthens the immune system and has anti-cancer attributes.
<P>
<STRONG>60 Tablets		$29.00		Product JP-12</STRONG>

<STRONG><I>MANNATECH PLUS (TM)</I></STRONG>
<P>
For decades, the extraordinary properties of aloe vera have been well known.  While other aloe products claim to be 99% pure, most contain little or none of the active aloe polymannan.  This product contains a patented, stable extract of aloe's active ingredient called, Manapol (R).  Like soy protein, Manapol contains phytochemicals which boost the immune system and metabolism.  
<P>
Mannatech Plus (TM) is a proprietary blend of Dioscorea and Manapol (R), along with herbs and extracts, and provides unique building blocks for the body's production of prohormones.  Enhanced prohormone production can aid the body in its burning of fat, balancing of hormones, recovery from exercise, energy production, and regulation of metabolism.  In addition, this supplement supports the endocrine system's protection of the body against a variety of degenerative diseases.

<H3>By <A HREF="#author">Alana Pascal</A> with Lynne Van der Kar</H3><P>
<B>Kombucha</B>, also known as "mushroom tea" is considered a miracle source of healing and energy. Thousands are drinking and brewing the tea telling stories of how it helps conditions such as arthritis, cancer, and psoriasis. It reportedly detoxifies the liver, reduces grey hair and wrinkles, increases energy, balances the pH system, and much more. In this book you will find a wealth of information surrounding this mysterious yeast and bacteria culture.<P>

<I>"As an information source, Kombucha is a must-own reference book. Anyone interested in how food is transformed into energy, or which vitamins, minerals and nutrients benefit what parts of the body, should use Kombucha as a primer. On the subjects of nutrition, health and biology, this is the most thorough and accurate book I have ever read." <B>The Whole Life Times</B><P>

"Yes, the tea is wonderful and helpful and healing. This book is a responsible, common sense work...a delight as well as an education. Fortunately, the authors had the good sense to research this subject and bring us the facts." <B>Awareness Magazine</B><P>

"This is not a book of testimonials, but of the facts. This book tells you the do's and don'ts, how to make the best tea and what to watch out for. Read the book!" <B>Magical Blend Magazine</B><P>

"Here are all the answers in a readable, easy to follow and understand book that more than tells what we want to know. This book dispels the mysteries surrounding Kombucha... everyone should read it at least once. I highly recommend this eye-opening book." <B>Spring Lake News</B></I><P>

New, updated edition of  <I>Dr. Pitcairn's Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats</I>, Richard H. Pitcairn, DVM, Ph.D,. and Susan Hubble Pitcairn, Rodale Press, <B>Product #NS-1: $16.95</B>
<P>
A great book just got better.  The revised edition of <I>Complete Guide</I> has all the original chapters and a few new sections at the end.  Everything is easier to find and understand.  In addition there have been improvements in recipes and recommendations.
<P>
The recipes have been revised, and meat is measured in both cups and pounds, instead of just cups as the old book had.  This makes it easier to shop for ingredients.  There is more emphasis on using vitamins, and more are added to the diet recipes.  They fall into line with my own preferences, so I no longer have to suggest to my clients, "in addition, add...."   The diets for special problems are also improved.  For example, the diet for kidney failure has a decreased percentage of protein.  This was another area where I used to add in my own suggestion.
<P>
Some sections have been expanded upon.  The original appendix on Sources has been expanded with commentary on each source, and there is also a section on recommended reading and tapes, listed chapter by chapter.  Added to the chart on congenital problems in breeds are physical needs, trainability, aggressiveness, and type of companionship they offer.  This makes it even easier for the owner to make the correct choice when selecting a breed.
<P>
Tables are now listed in the table of contents.  There are separate sections on treatment schedules for herbal and homeopathic treatments, so once you have your remedies, you can just refer to these sections for proper dosage.
<P>
The only thing I can fault Dr. Pitcairn on, is that the congenital problems charts are based on information published in 1983 for cats, and 1986 for dogs. As a result some popular breeds like the Shar Pei (with more potential skin problems than any other breed) are not listed.  Others don't have some serious problems listed (about 70% of my favorite breed, the Doberman, have a bleeding disorder--not even mentioned in the book).  And some are not correctly described (I disagree that the German Shepherd with its raked back has a "Natural size and shape").  The omissions don't take away from the overall usefulness of the chart, however.
<P>
If you enjoyed the original version of this book, you will find the updated edition even handier, with even more information to help you with your quest for more holistic knowledge.  If you don't have this book, run out and get it.  Anyone with a dog or cat should have it as a cornerstone of their holistic animal book collection.

<a name="guide">
<I>The Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog</I>, Wendy Volhard & Kerry Brown, DVM, Macmillan. <B>Product #NS-2: $20.00</B>
<P>
Wendy Volhard is a trainer/behaviorist who has teamed with Dr. Brown, a holistic veterinarian, to write this book.  If you are interested in knowing a little more about specific nutrients, this book treats the subject in depth, with separate chapters on vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates, etc.  There is also an excellent chapter on lab tests, which discusses every common test done, and what they mean.  Applied kinesiology is described with pictures and suggestions of how to do it and what to test for.
<P>
The sections on herbs and homeopathy are less clear.  In the herbal chapter, diesease problems are listed, followed by a list of herbs but no indication of how to use them.  Homeopathic remedies are listed by remedy, followed by a list of diseases. To find a how to treat for a problem you have to read through the whole list.
<P>
Their version of the Natural Diet is based on Juliette de Bairacli Levy's book and updated with other information.  It is a good diet, but in my experience, its complexity tempts guardians to leave parts out.  The main part consists of a grain-based portion in the morning, and a meat-based portion in the evening.  Companions may take advantage of their guardians' good nature to try to eat only the meat portion.  Also, since the diet is changed daily and includes a weekly fast, guardians who prefer simplicity tend to leave the varying ingredients out, which changes the ability of the diet to fill the needs of the animal.  Guardians who can't find it in their hearts to fast their companion will end up with an overweight furry friend on this diet.  And finally, animals with special needs (like those with kidney problems) are not addressed.
<P>
This is a good addition to Pitcairn's book, for those who are interested in the whys and hows of nutrition, lab tests and applied kinesiology.  If  you will commit to follow the whole program, the diet is an interesting alternative to Pitcairn's.  I would recommend referring to other books for information on herbs and homeopathy.

<a name="naturally">
<I>Your Cat Naturally</I>, Grace McHattie, Caroll & Graf, <B>Product #NS-3: $18.95</B>  Natural Remedies by Tim Couzens, B. Vet. Med., M.R.C.V.S., Vet MF Hom.
<P>
Grace McHattie is the "Anitra Frazier" of the United Kingdom, active in all aspects of cat care.  Dr. Couzens is well-versed in homeopathy and herbal medicine.  The result is an excellent book profusely illustrated with beautiful photographs and paintings.
<P>
Dr. Couzens wrote an introduction to Natural Medicine with excellent guidelines for when you need to see a veterinarian, and when to try treating an ailment by yourself.  General care, including subjects such as nail care, choices of litter, and enriching the kitty environment, are well-presented.  Too many of these common areas are neglected or not properly covered by neophyte guardians.  Each problem that is discussed includes recommendations for herbal and homeopathic remedies, including dosage schedules.  The photographs are perfectly matched to the subject matter.
<P>
The author prefers canned and dry food to the Natural Diet.  There is a good discussion of some reasons why the Natural Diet may not fit in your life, and why low-cost store-bought foods aren't good for your friend.However, I would recommend ignoring most of the food chapter.  They include semi-moist food for cats, which should NEVER be fed.  They also don't go far enough in explaining how to choose a decent commercial diet.
<P>
For excellent information on general care which even seasoned guardians might learn from, and for good information on homeopathic and herbal remedies, Grace McHattie's book is a good addition to your library.  For a discussion of the Natural Diet, be sure you have a different source.

<a name="catcare">
<I>Cat Care, Naturally</I>, Celeste Yarnall, Charles E. Tuttle Co.<B>Product #NS-4: $24.95</B>
<P>
Celeste's extensively researched and referenced book illustrates the pros and cons of writing a book about health care without a veterinary co-author.  Her book is very complete, and includes sections not seen in many other books, such as nonverbal communication, astromedicine (treating by astrological sign), and vaccinosis. Each of  these areas is given a separate, in-depth chapter.  Her section on the Natural Diet is very good, with a basic recipe that is easy to follow, and with lists of ingredients that can be substituted for the basic ones. She also gives a good overview of other non-traditional healing methods such as crystals, reiki, and magnetic therapy.
<P>
Though she does caution against treating your cat companion without the advice of a holistic veterinarian, the tendency for guardians is to skip all the precautions, read about a specific problem, try treatment first, and then to contact the veterinarian. (I say this because part of my practice consists of undoing improper treatment, both allopathic and holistic.)  The suggestions in her section on Natural Remedies can lead to problems.
<P>
Like essentially all holistic animal health books except Dr. Pitcairn's, there is no discussion of diet changes needed for heart problems, liver problems, kidney problems, etc.  In addition, vitamins and minerals must be used with caution in specific diseases.  For example, the 400 IU of vitamin E recommended by Celeste for heart problems can be dangerous for some heart problems and for diabetes.  The iodine recommended by Celeste for thyroid problems can make a hyperthyroid cat worse. And in any question about urinary problems in a male cat, I always recommend seeing a veterinarian unless you have learned to distinguish a blocked bladder from other problems.  (And yes, I have seen blocked bladders in cats on the Natural Diet.)
<P>
And finally, in her recommendations on acupuncture, she reflects a bias toward homeopathy.  Most of her sources for this chapter are veterinarians who don't practice classic acupuncture.  Each of us uses the modality of healing that reflects what we do best and we make our recommendations based on our biases.  It is ironic that she quotes Dr. Pitcairn (a great homeopath who doen't practice acupuncture at all) more than any other veterinarian in this chapter. Despite the recommendations of Celeste and some veterinary homeopaths, I know many veterinarians who successfully use homeopathy and acupuncture together, myself included, rather than separating them.  I personally find that acupuncture with needles works better than aquapuncture (injections in acupuncture sites), unlike the veterinarian quoted in the chapter, and cats that I treat are more comfortable with the needles than with injections.  And finally, despite what Celeste says, acupuncture does not merely treat symptoms; it can cure disease.  Why else would the Chinese use it for 5,000 years?
<P>
<I>Cat Care, Naturally</I> is an excellent book for those who want to delve deeper into all holistic modalities of treatment. It is a great place to start for anyone who is interested in the Natural Diet for their cat companion.  For a healthy cat, it has good guidelines.  However, if your cat has serious disease problems, be very cautious when using her recommendations.

<STRONG><I>"Sweet is every sound, Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet; Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn, The moan of doves in immemorial elms, And murmuring of ennumerable bees."</I> Tennyson, 1847</STRONG>
<P>
<HR>
<a name="intro">
Sound therapy for people has been studied and used for a number of years.
The late John Craige, V.M.D. , who pioneered many holistic veterinary 
practices, and his wife, developed a method to test animals suffering from 
different disorders utilizing sound frequencies.  After years of tests they
determined that some frequencies are specific to certain disorders. 
<P>
You know what "well-tuned" means.  But it has more than a metaphorical
meaning.  A healthy body is in harmony, or in tune, with the universe. An
unhealthy body suffers from some disharmony; in other words, it is 
out-of-tune.

<a name="review">
<B><I>"Dr. Craige and his wife, Joy Birdsall-Craige, developed several audio tapes
they've found effective in treating common feline viruses; skin allergies and
severe itching; joint, tendon, and muscle disorders; circulatory and heart
conditions, intestinal tract disorders, urinary tract disorders and immune
system weaknesses.  When a cat or kitten is convalescing, I place a small
tape player nearby and play the Craige tape specific to its condition."</I></B>

<STRONG><I>Cat Care, Naturally</I>, by Celeste Yarnall, published 1995</STRONG>

<P>
<a name="final">

As Ms. Yarnall points out in her book, such work is in its infancy, and sound
therapy is not recommended as an alternative to medical or other treatment,
but rather as a complement to such treatment.   Dr. and Mrs. Craige jointly
authored a series of published articles about therapeutic sound for animals.
<P>
The Craiges believed that specific sound frequencies can help a sick/injured
animal bring its own energy back into harmony by providing the particular
frequency at which it is out of harmony.  Once energy is flowing harmoniously
the body's own healing powers can be fully utilized.  Sick animals generally respond, and often recover from their disorders while using this unique, safe
treatment. The following audio cassette tapes are available; <B>each is $25.00:</B>

<CENTER><STRONG>Be Aware Of The Heat!</STRONG></CENTER><P>
Many pet owners are very conscientious about providing their animal companions with all their daily needs, including adequate shelter and fresh water. However, this awareness sometimes stops at the doorsteps to our homes. <P>
How many of you have witnessed bicyclers riding or joggers running as much as five miles or more without stopping, while their dog is running alongside? You <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> provide that pet with rest and water, long before you may need or want it, especially in the summer months!  ALSO, similar precautions should be followed at the beach, in the park and on the mountainsides.<P>
Also, even in the winter on sunny days, let alone during summer, you cannot leave a pet in the car for a moment UNLESS you have provided a safe, full water dish, left the windows (or sunroof) opened a great deal, and parked in the shade. Even then, you are risking brain damage or the death of your pet.<P>
<STRONG>NO</STRONG> pet belongs in the open bed of a pickup truck<STRONG> UNLESS</STRONG> you have him or her secured by a short-enough lead to prevent jumping over the side or falling out (completely or partially).  That SHORT lead needs to be attached to a strong locked and sealed hook devise such as a locking towhook, inside the truck bed. 
<P>ALSO, the bed should be covered with a canvas cover (commonly found with Jeeps, Sidekicks, Trackers, etc).Finally, apply a good coat of sunscreen onto your pet, especially the nose and ears, places where there is little or no fur.

<CENTER><STRONG> Feeding Leftovers</STRONG></CENTER><P>
Some leftovers are great for our furry friends, while others can cause problems.  I'm sure you all know not to give them any splintery chicken or pork bones, which can puncture intestines.  Too much fat, including butter, lamb fat, or any other form of fat, can cause diarrhea.  
<P>At its worst it can also cause pancreatitis.  This potentially deadly disease, at its worst, causes the pancreas to release digestive juices into the body cavity.  This will damage organs and cause vomiting, diarrhea, pain, and even shock.  Too much meat OF ANY KIND can be hard on an older dog or cat's kidneys. 
<P>So play it safe and give them the things that are good for them:  veggies, some starches, and just a taste of protein. And remember <I><STRONG>CHOCOLATE IS POISON!</STRONG></I> Also, some animals are allergic to <B>onions!</B>
<P>OTHER IMPORTANT NOTES: Do not use rawhide bones, they contain arsenic from the leather tanning process. Only use non-lead glass bowls. Avoid plastic, metal, aluminium and ceramic bowls. Use filtered, bottled or distilled water. Avoid any food that contains by-products or chemical additives.

ANIMAL CANCER FAQS BY DR. NANCY SCANLAN </FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>
<P>
1.  What is the difference between a benign tumor and cancer.
<UL>
<LI>

	A benign tumor sits there and grows slowly.  If you remove it, it doesn't 
	return.  However, if it is in the wrong place (like deep in the brain),
	it can still kill.</LI>

<LI>

	Cancer is a malignant tumor, which invades tissues aggressively.  It may only
	invade locally, or it may metastasize and spread to areas far away, like the
	lungs and liver.  The most malignant types grow rapidly and have already spread
	or metastasized to other organs before the original tumor is detected.  So a malignant
	tumor of the skin that is only locally invasive can have a better outlook than a
	benign tumor of the brain.</LI>

<LI>

	Cancers are now "staged", or classified into degrees of malignancy.  The mild types
	have a more hopeful outlook than the severe types.</LI>
</UL>

<P>

2.  What causes cancer?
<UL>
<LI>

	There is nothing that will always cause cancer in all animals.  There are 
	contributing factors, and the more different things an animal is exposed to,
	the more likely that an animal will get cancer.  The longer an animal
	is exposed to a carcinogen (cancer-causing substance), the more likely the
	animal will get cancer.  The more cancer-causing factors an animal is exposed
	to, the more likely that an animal will get cancer.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
3.  What are some of these factors?
<UL>
<LI>
	
	Heredity (Boxers get more cancer than any other breed.  They are also more
	likely than other breeds, to have more than one type of cancer.  Also, rats
	and mice are famous for the development of specific cancers in specific
	related lines.)</LI>

<LI>
	Physical characteristics (Gray horses are more likely to get melanoma)
	(This is related to heredity.)</LI>


<LI>
	Environment.  (Excess exposure to sun can cause skin cancer.)</LI>


<LI>
	Toxins.  (Tars cause cancer)</LI>


<LI>
	Physical and mental stress (There is a human personality type which has been
	linked with cancer.  These are people who hold everything in, worry about the
	world, and present a smiley face to everyone.  Universal mothers who don't
	take care of themselves.)</LI>

</UL>

<P>
4.  How can cancer be inherited?

<UL>
<LI>
	There are actual cancer-causing genes ("oncogenes") that are present in 
	higher number in cancer-prone individuals.  </LI>


<LI>
	There are also cancer-fighting cells which are more efficient in some
	individuals than in others.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
5.  How do environment and chemicals cause cancer?

<UL>
<LI>
	One way is to cause damage by increasing "free radicals."  These free radicals
	are very active chemical substances which react with tissues and change their
	chemical composition.  These damaged tissues may lose the genetic instructions
	that control their normal cell division.  This turns them into cancer cells.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
6.  How can we prevent cancer?

<UL>
<LI>
	Avoid environmental factors that cause cancer.  For example, pink-skinned
	cats should never go out in the sun, because they often develop skin cancer
	on ears and nose--areas not well-protected by fur.</LI>


<LI>
	A second way is to increase the amounts of anti-oxidants in the food.  This
	includes beta carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, pycnogenol, and others.  Anti-
	oxidants are free radical scavengers (they de-activate free radicals).  
	Controlled medical studies have proven their ability to decrease the
	incidence of cancer in humans.  I think it's about time we start using 
	humans as lab animals and apply the results in animals--so I take these
	results and recommend that my patients receive extra anti-oxidants, above
	the amount present in dog or cat food.  (This includes home-made diets also.)</LI>

</UL>

<P>
7.  How can we cure cancer?
<UL>
<LI>

	Surgery</LI>

<LI>
	Diet change</LI>

<LI>
	Anti-oxidants</LI>

<LI>
	Herbs</LI>

<LI>
	Antibody therapy (such as IAT)</LI>

<LI>
	Maybe chemotherapy</LI>

</UL>

<P>
8.  I thought surgery just spread cancer around?
	
<UL>
<LI>
	Some types of cancer can be fully cured by surgery, if they only invade locally,
	if they are caught early, and if a big enough piece of tissue is removed.  Also,
	some types of benign tumors (such as mammary cancer) can turn into cancer if left
	long enough, so surgery is a better alternative.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
9.  Why not just take herbal cancer cures to prevent it?
<UL>
<LI>
	Herbs can be toxic.  You don't always get the right one--no one herb will cure all
	cancers.</LI>

ANIMAL ARTHRITIS FAQS BY DR. NANCY SCANLAN</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>
<P>



<P>1. What is arthritis?

<UL>
<LI>

A degeneration of joints , with inflammation and deformity..</LI>
</UL>

<P>2. What causes arthritis?
<UL>
<LI>

Either a joint deformity (such as hip dysplasia) that causes stress on a joint, overuse (seen in performance dogs, racing greyhounds, 
sheepdogs, and dogs who just naturally never slow down), and some diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and Lymes disease)..</LI>
</UL>

<P>3.  How can it be prevented?
<UL>
<LI>

Chiropractic and acupuncture help the overuse type.
Good diet and certain supplements help prevent its development in general.
</UL>

<P>4.  How can it be cured?
<UL>
<LI>

You can't cure this condition but you can help it and stop it from getting worse.  Things that help:  chiropractic, acupuncture, superoxide dismutase, vitamin E (400 IU per day), ester C (twice a day at whatever dose that almost causes diarrhea),  500 mg DLPA  (dl-phenylalanine) once to twice a day, 750 mg glucosamine sulfate per day or Cosequin or Glycoflex, homeopathic Rhus tox,

<LI>

 Adequan injections. ( Adequan is one of a group of chemicals which act as precursors for joint fluid and joint cartilage.  They help repair cartilage and "thicken" the joint fluid, decreasing inflammation and pain in joints.)   The dosage of Adequan is 1cc per 30 pounds body weight, intramuscular injection, twice the first week then once a week until results are seen (usually 1 to 4 weeks).  At that time you maintain on once a month (or less often) injections, using the dog's condition as a clue.  Cosequin and Glycoflex are two oral drugs with similar actions, but the Adequan often acts a little faster.
<LI>

Trace minerals can help, if they're the super type from seaweed or old sea bed or diatomaceous earth.  

<LI>
Don't give cortisone or prednisone or prednisolone--it gives temporary relief but causes long-term damage. Aspirin or phenylbutazone (also known as Bute or Butazolidin) can help with pain, but can cause intestinal bleeding .

<LI>
Mobility 2 (Chinese Herbal formula) from Health Concerns (company in Oakland)--has to be ordered by a vet or other health professional but helps relieve pain and inflammation and improve muscle strength.

<LI>
Though a lot of the stuff can be ordered by your vet, many veterinarians are unaware of them, even though they may be carried by regular drug companies or their distributors.
.</LI>
</UL>

<P>5.  What type of diet is best?
<UL>
<LI>

Either a natural raw food diet, such as Dr. Pitcairn's.  If you can't prepare it, use an all-natural diet with no artificial
flavors, colors, or preservatives, and no meat or poultry by-products.
.</LI>
</UL>

<P>6.  What is the best vitamin I can use?
<UL>
<LI>

If you don't give any other supplement at least use Sodium Ascorbate.  It is a neutral pH form of Vit C.
The recommended dose is to bowel tolerance.  That is so the stool is soft, but not runny.</LI>

</UL>


<P>7.  What else causes weakness?
<UL>
<LI>

A hypothyroid condition  can contribute to weight gain and to weakness.  This can be helped by high doses of antioxidants, (vitamins C and E, and superoxide dismutase) which raise cortisol and therefore the T4 level.  Kelp tablets also help.

<LI>
Cervical instability or "Wobblers" disease causes weakness in the front legs.

<LI>
Degenerative myelopathy also can cause weakness.  For further information, see the degenerative myelopathy FAQ.

.</LI>
</UL>

<P>8.  I have a dog in otherwise good health who has just been diagnosed with demyelinating disease of the spinal cord and nerves
with loss of position sense in his back feet with progressive paralysis.  Do you know of any possible treatment or medication  (including experimental)?  Would you know of any Veterinarian who specializes in this kind of condition who might be able to provide asssistance? 
<UL>

<LI>
4 things to try:  ester C twice a day, starting at 500 mg per dose and increasing until the stool becomes slightly soft, not runny.
<LI>
Aminocaproic acid
<LI>
n-acetylcysteine
<LI>
acupuncture
.</LI>
</UL>

<P>9.  My veterinarian says  it's dangerous to take my dog to a chiropractor.  Why is this?
<UL>
<LI>

Chiropractors who are not familiar with dog anatomy or specific diseases can do more harm than good.  I get e-mail like this sometimes:  

<LI>
"I am a chiropractor in Montreal since 1975.  Today I was asked to adjust 
or at least examine a 9 year old 150 lb. Doberman.  Apparently this dog 
had lost its ability to walk on its front paws and used its wrists 
instead.  

<LI>
"The vet informed the owner of the dog that surgery or euthanasia were the 
options.  The owner called the breeder in Philadelphia and asked his 
advice.  Chiroractic was his only suggestion with apparent recognition of 
the problem and previous successes.  

<LI>
"My associate examined the dog and found an instability at the thoraco 
dorsal junction.  The dog was anaesthetized and manipulated in the area 
sensitive upon palpation.  On x-ray the specific area was noted to be 
misaligned in an anterior/posterior plane.  

<LI>
"The dog was adjusted.  The dog immediately opened its mouth (much like a 
person does on their first adjustment).  As of my last contact with my 
associate, the dog has not regained consciousness from the anaesthesia. "

<LI>
This dog has Wobblers disease.  The neck was too unstable to take a strenuous adjustment.  The dog died later.  BE SURE that any chiropractor has had training from the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association before they work on your dog.

<P>
During this past spring and summer, here in Los Angeles, a human set a dog on fire, another hung his dog with a rope, and  many different sets of parents abandoned their newborn babies in trash dumpsters!  In May, a Right-to-Life group picketing outside a family planning clinic approached a yellow school bus carrying grammar school children and held picket signs bearing photographs of dead fetuses up against the bus windows (guess those kindergarten kids will be sure to practice abstinence or safe sex now!), and  the Make-A-Wish-Foundation granted a last wish to a dying teenager to hunt and  kill a Kodiak bear in Alaska. What a life-affirming act for a dying boy!
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>.........OR IS IT THE ANIMALS?</STRONG></CENTER>
During the same time period a mother cat went back inside a burning home five times to save each of her five kittens,  a dog dialed 911 to save his human companion having a seizure, another dog saved the life of his human guardian by bringing water and squeezing a wet rag to moisten the lips of the immobilized heart attack victim, until help finally came days later; and this past weekend a Gorilla rescued a seriously injured 3-year old boy from almost certain death.

<P>
<CENTER>Ohhh, Our Aching Joints and What Can We Do About It</CENTER>
<P>
The word itself comes from the Greek word "arthron" meaning inflammation.  In common usage most health practitioners use the term, "arthritis," to cover the more than 60 different conditions that cause various joint inflammations and degenerative changes.  Arthritis can attack any joint in the body, at any age, and affects both people and animals (dogs more than cats).
<P>
A few of the common types of arthritis are:  Spondylosis - spinal arthritis, Osteoarthritis - the erosion of cartilage (a dense connective tissue which covers the ends of bones at the joints) permits the rough surfaces of the bones to rub together, Hip Dysplasia - pressure on a canine's hip joint remodels the joint itself.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Causes</H3></CENTER>

Arthritis often begins with an injury or infection of a joint.  When such a problem occurs, the body begins a series of reactions to initiate the process of healing.  This includes a short stage of inflammation.  If the inflammation takes longer to dissipate than it should, the problem can become chronic, impairing healing.  
<P>
Current research indicates that free radical stress is often a critical cause of the inflammation associated with arthritis.  Every joint in the body is surrounded by a capsule of synovial fluid which keeps the joint properly lubricated and allows free movement.  Free radicals can build up in the joint capsule and over time can oxidize (rust is the oxidation of iron) the lining of the capsule, the joint cartilage, and surrounding tissues.  
<P>
Free radicals are a natural waste product of cellular metabolism.  When the body is injured in some way, cells are rushed to the afflicted area to help eliminate the noxious agents or damaged tissue.  With all the excess cellular activity, a higher than normal amount of waste products are released.  If the affected area is a joint the free radicals are released into the small, enclosed joint capsule.  In optimal conditions a body's cells produce enough antioxidant enzymes to neutralize free radicals.
<P>
When under stress, however, such as that caused by an injury, free radicals overwhelm the body's anti oxidizing mechanism.  Other causes of antioxidant depletion are: infection, emotional upset, environmental pollution, old age, and inadequate nutrition.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Identifying Arthritis</H3></CENTER>

Arthritis cannot be seen in X-rays until the condition is well-advanced.  Then permanent changes, such as calcium deposits, loss of cartilage and the malformation of the joint itself can be seen.  Fortunately, arthritis can often be recognized and treated before the damage becomes grossly debilitating and permanent.  
<P>

Here's a brief list of symptoms generally associated with arthritis in humans and their animal companions: 
<UL><LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Joint inflammation (swelling, pain, stiffness) not directly associated with an injury</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Stiffness after periods of inactivity, as upon arising in the morning</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Slow recovery from injury</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Creaking, grinding or cracking sounds in joints</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Loss of mobility</LI></UL>

The following are symptoms specific to our four-legged companions:
<UL><LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Slipping, dragging hind quarters, tripping, or excessive sliding on slick floors</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Uneven weight distribution between paws</LI>
<LI>
	<img src="bl_ball.gif">Trembling limbs. </LI></UL>

<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><H2><A NAME="Allergy"> Animal Allergy Alert</A> </H2></CENTER>

<P>
Modern society's increasing susceptibility to allergies does not exclude our companion animals.  Though symptoms may manifest in other systems, the skin and coat of your pet are nearly always affected.  In fact, the most frequent cause of skin problems for animals is allergies.
<P>
In a desire to alleviate their companions' pain and anxiety, people sometimes tend to emphasize treating the symptoms in the most expeditious manner, rather than in finding a cure.  Although steroids and anti-histamines often temporarily suppress the itching and scratching associated with allergies, it is not in our animals' best interest to ignore the larger issues of cause and prevention.   The side effects of these drugs and their impact on health should also be considered.
<P>
The holistic approach is to strengthen and desensitize the animal's own immune system so that it no longer overreacts to allergens, such as pollen or, one of the most common, flea bites.  This involves nutritional, emotional, and medical support.  
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>What Can You Do? </H3></CENTER>

Allergy tests can be run to determine what allergens, including foods, affect your companion.  If sensitivities to certain foods, such as beef or corn, show up just delete those items from the animal's diet (including treats).  Your dog or cat's immune system may be under attack with every meal.  You can help your pet overcome almost any kind of allergy by supplying a natural, high-quality diet. 
<P>
Be careful of foods which contain yeast, to which some animals are sensitive.  A healthful diet with a good vitamin/mineral supplement along with food enzymes, acidophilus, garlic and Omega-3 and -6 can be decisive.  Be sure to supply fresh distilled or purified water.  Adding 1/2 teaspoon of chlorophyll per pint of water is also of value.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Hands-On Treatment</H3></CENTER>

For more direct relief of the itching, we find oatmeal based shampoos and conditioners very beneficial for skin with lesions.  To draw toxins out of the body, give your pet Epsom salt soaks (1/2 cup salts per gallon of water) for 15 minutes and rinse.
<P>
Acupressure and acupuncture can be used to gradually help strengthen your pet's immune system and to relieve itching.  You can utilize convenient acupressure points located where the atlas bone makes a noticeable bump right behind and below each ear.  Massage the points, using your left hand, whenever you notice your pet scratching.  In addition to improving the immune system, this usually relieves the itching after several minutes of stimulation.
<P>
Acupuncture treatment has an even stronger, longer-lasting impact.  However, strengthening the immune system internally is the permanent solution.  With the right nutrients your animal will probably be able to build a strong immune system and body, free of allergies and itching.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Desensitization</H3></CENTER>

Desensitization can also be helpful for extreme allergies, or when exposure to the allergen(s) cannot be controlled long enough to allow the animal's immune system to be fortified.  This approach is especially useful for animals allergic to pollen.  Begin adding a tiny quantity of pure, raw (i.e. never heated) bee pollen to food.  As your pet builds up a resistance, gradually increase the amount and eventually he or she should no longer suffer from the allergy.  This natural method has the additional benefit of providing your animal with an excellent food supplement.  It works for people, too.
<P>
One of the most frequent allergies in animals is to flea bites.  Fleas inject saliva into their host whenever they feed.  This saliva is an allergen, and over time, as animals are bitten many times, they can develop an allergic reaction.  There is an injectible flea antigen available, which was first created for people.  Veterinarians have access to it and a series of small injections can be extremely helpful in desensitizing an animal to flea bites.  Fleas have other bothersome and harmful effects, so during flea season, still continue to use non-toxic flea products to rid your pet and home of fleas.
<P>
There really is hope for the allergic animal.  These natural methods have proved themselves innumerable times.  And what a pleasure it is to stroke the lustrous, soft fur and smooth skin of your healthy companion.

This is the second of a two part series.  The <a href="newslet.htm">previous issue</a> covered what arthritis is, what causes it, and identifying symptoms.This issue will focus on natural treatment of arthritis to improve mobility and decrease pain.  First though, let's explore the importance of <B><I>prevention</I></B>.
<P>
An article in a recent issue of CATS magazine stated that, "There's no way to prevent age-related arthritic conditions in cats."  This is a typical, standard medical opinion.  It stems from the belief that living itself is a debilitating process which will gradually leave us, and our animals, pain-ridden, frail and decrepit creatures.  Well, as the song goes, "T'ain't necessarily so."
<P>

<a name="prevention"><CENTER><B>Prevention</B></CENTER>

<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><P>
It is far better, and easier, to prevent arthritis from ever developing than to treat it once it occurs.  Prevention can begin even before an animal is born.  A number of holistic veterinarians and practitioners, such as Dr. Richard Pitcairn, DVM, and Dr. John Craige, VMD, found that proper nutrition, including natural vitamin C, provided to pregnant females will help safeguard their offspring from arthritis.  Proper nutrition means a natural diet, including raw meats and vegetables.  Dr. Craige wrote that vitamin C is especially important to collagen metabolism, and that all arthritic conditions are essentially collagen disorders.
<P>
One point many allopathic veterinarians make is that animals can produce their own vitamin C, an ability humans do not have.  However, dogs, particularly, produce a minimal amount compared to many other species.  It shouldn't surprise us that supplements, such as vitamin C, are important to overcome the poor diet and polluted environment modern society affords our companions and to help them remain in good health throughout their lives.  
<P>
By feeding the mother properly during gestation, her young are far more likely to have properly formed joints and thus far less likely to develop arthritis later in life.  A healthful diet is just as important during the life of the animal, of course.  Most of us don't have anything to do with the prenatal care of our companions, so providing them with a good diet and life as soon as they are in our keeping is when we can help.  
<P>
Another important health issue, for many reasons, is keeping your companion at the proper weight.  An animal carrying excess pounds places extra stress on joints.  Animals are like people, some love to eat, and love to eat a lot, others never overeat or are slim regardless of their diet.  Fortunately, you manage the amount and type of food your animal eats and you can make sure he or she stays lean.  Regular exercise can also help control an animal's weight, and promotes bone and joint soundness.  <P>

<CENTER>External Therapies</CENTER>
<P>
There are several commonly used alternative treatments.  Acupuncture, chiropractic and massage are the methods most widely accepted.
<P>
Acupuncture has been used to treat animals for thousands of years.  Classical practitioners believe that stimulating acupuncture points with tiny needles placed into the skin restores the proper flow of energy (or, "chi") through the body and promotes healing.  Western practitioners tend to explain the effect in terms of endorphins being released and increasing microcirculation to joint capsules.  In either case, many animals seem to improve, even to be symptom free, after a series of acupuncture treatments.  If the arthritic condition has caused structural changes to the joint(s) a maintenance level of treatments is common, from as often as once a month to only once a year, depending on the condition's severity.
<P>
Chiropractic adjustments can help reduce pain and restore as much normal function to joints as is possible.  Typically, two to three adjustments are necessary for maximal benefit, and often some maintenance level to keep everything properly adjusted.  Chiropractic for animals is always a low-impact technique, because animals have thinner disc material, and therefore a greater risk of injury than humans.  A separate, but related technique to chiropractic manipulation is Feldenkreis.  This is a gentle and effective neuro-muscular method of rehabilitating and restoring natural movement and reducing pain.
<P>
Massage and acupressure are techniques you can use for your companion yourself.  Each can be used alone, or in between acupuncture or chiropractic treatments to make those therapies even more effective.  There are various styles of massage which can loosen up a sore, stiff area, reducing the pain and increasing mobility.  By stimulating acupuncture points through hand or finger pressure you can provide some of the benefits of acupuncture.  Your animal's acupuncturist can show you the best points to massage, or if acupuncture treatment is not accessible to you, a number of holistic animal care books include illustrations and directions for using acupressure. 
<P>

<a name="treatment2"><CENTER>Internal Methods</CENTER>
<P>
<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><P>
Alternative internal treatments for arthritis focus on providing the body with the appropriate materials it needs to help heal itself.  The three approaches, by no means exclusive of one another, are, diet, supplements and homeopathy.
<P>
Diet is the core of whatever you try to do for your companion.  If the most you can do for your companion is pour some dry food into a bowl once a day, than at least make it the best dry food you can purchase.  Look for high-quality foods without by-products, artificial preservatives, flavorings, or artificial anything. 
<P>
For a dog with arthritis, many holistic veterinarians suggest a low to medium protein diet, which would be food containing between 16 - 20% protein.  Cats need a higher percentage of protein, approximately 60%.  Dr. Pitcairn, Dr. Christina Chambreau, and other holistic practitioners emphasize excluding any kind of yeast from the diet of animals with arthritis.  
<P>
Commercial foods typically included yeast, but if you review the list of ingredients printed on all pet food packages, you will be able to find some high-quality products which do not include it.  In addition to aggravating an arthritic condition, approximately 20% of animals are allergic to yeast, and this allergy can result in a wide variety of problems if animals receive it daily in their food. <B>EDITOR'S NOTE: Flint River Ranch products are the perfect all-natural prepared dry food EXCEPT for the 20% of animals allergic to yeast.</B>
<P>
The best diet is a natural one, using some raw meats and ground raw vegetables.  In some areas frozen, packaged raw food meals can be purchased.  In Southern California, Pat McKay sells a variety of such meals for cats and dogs.
<P>
<hr><P>
<a name="treatment3">
<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><P>
Supplements can be an important complement to diet in alleviating arthritis.  They can be used to reduce inflammation and supply the nutrients needed for proper joint functioning.  Be sure any supplement you select is free of yeast, a common additive in nutritional supplements.
<P>
One of the best supplements is vitamin C, which has been found to be helpful in treating, as well as in preventing arthritis.  Dr. G.E. Berge, a holistic vet in Norway, conducted a study with 100 dogs of different breeds and ages, all diagnosed with stable arthritic ailments.  These ranged from spondylosis and hip dysplasia, to senile wear changes in support and movement tissue.  The dogs were given approximately 60 mgs of Ester C for each five pounds of body weight three times a day for six months.  
<P>
The results, published in The Norwegian Veterinary Journal, showed that after one week, 75% of the dogs showed good improvement or were symptom free, and that this number remained stable throughout the study period.  Dr. Pitcairn recommends 500 to 3,000 mg a day of C for animals suffering from arthritis, depending on their size, and the dose divided up rather than given all at once.  The benefit of Ester C compared to regular C (ascorbic acid), is that the Esterfied C is more bioavailable and does not cause gastric distress.  
<P>
An important note:  recent studies indicate that vitamin C is far more effective if used in conjunction with vitamin E and selenium.  However, C and selenium should not be given together, that is at the same time.  For best response, separate the Ester C from the E/selenium supplement by at least 90 minutes.   
<P>
Proper timing and combination are important issues. Supplements do not always produce the good effects for which we hope.  The benefits of a supplement can be weakened or nullified by giving it at the wrong time, or without the necessary ancillary nutrients.  Supplements do not work in a vacuum. 
<P>
 In order for the body to use them, it must have all the nutrients which support metabolism, or it will not be able to efficiently utilize a specific element.  If you put gas in a car and no oil, it still won't run, at least not for long.  That is why a good diet, including a basic, all-around supplement and digestive enzymes, is so important.  This is a cornerstone of health; on this foundation you can build, as you need to, for your animal companion's special needs.
<P>
SOD is the acronym for superoxide dismutase.  It is a highly effective antioxidant enzyme.  The body produces SOD itself, but overuse and stress deplete the body's ability to create this important free radical destroyer.  Michael Lemmon, DVM, and other veterinarians, have found that dismutase supplements can provide valuable antioxidant protection and can quickly reduce the buildup of free radicals and toxins that produce the inflammation and pain of arthritic ailments.  It is also useful when an animal is injured to speed healing and prevent an injury from becoming a chronic problem.  
<P>
If free radicals build up in the joint capsule (the sac surrounding the joint containing synovial fluid), they slowly dissolve the lining of the capsule.  The lining loses its smooth, liquid-containing properties and becomes rough, eventually turning soft and spongy.  The synovial fluid becomes less lubricating and begins to leak out of the damaged capsule lining.  The result is more friction and stress on the joint.  The body will try to stabilize the area with additional calcium deposits, which are often the first sign of damage that can be detected on an X-ray, long after the original damage began.
<P>
Other, inexpensive supplements often recommended for arthritis are, bone meal as a good source of calcium; yucca herb as a detoxifier and anti-inflammatory; garlic, which has many healing properties; and gelatin (Knox is the highest quality), which is made from bovine cartilage and can be utilized by the body in its own cartilage building efforts. <B>EDITOR'S NOTE: Winston's Joint Formula contains a full spectrum of anti-inflamatory, lubricating and healing ingredients in a 3-tablet formula taken two to three times daily, depending on the animal's size.</B>
<P>
Finally, there are a number of supplement mixtures produced specifically for treating arthritis.  They tend to be expensive, but many practitioners have reported excellent results.  Adequan is an injectible that increases the fluid within the joint sac.  Cosequin is a patented combination of chondroitin sulfates (the structural components of joint cartilage), glucosamine (the raw material used to regenerate cartilage) and manganese ascorbate.  It has been, and continues to be, studied at veterinary colleges.  These two products are available only from veterinarians.  
<P>
Mobility 2 and 3 are arthritis formulas of various Chinese herbs that have been used for 5,000 years..  Both combinations work as anti-inflammatories and support the immune system.  This can be particularly helpful with rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune process.  Another formula, called simply, Natural Pain Relief for Arthritis, combines almost all of the nutrients recent research studies have found most effective in alleviating arthritic symptoms, in what is believed to be a synergistic combination.  Results for this new product are promising.
<P>
Homeopathic remedies focus on the individual.  Homeopathy treats the patient, not the disease, or symptom.  Therefore, an animal with arthritis should be seen by a homeopathic practitioner, since the remedy will be specific to that particular animal.  Various studies have reported positive results for human patients with arthritis using homeopathic treatment.  Remember, homeopathy is a very exact method of treatment for arthritis, one remedy will not work for all, or even most, animals.
<P>

This is only a brief overview of what you can do to prevent and treat arthritis holistically.  None of these methods is exclusive.  Often, practitioners start with one modality, and if needed, add others until they find the right combination for their patient.  Holistic methods tend to be synergistic, and build on one another. To learn more, read some of the recent holistic animal health care books.  One of the most popular is Dr. Pitcairn's, Natural Health for Dogs and Cats.

ASPARTAME CONSUMER SAFETY NETWORK FACT SHEET,
Written by NBC TV's former Network Physician and world class Pediatrician
/ Author: Lendon Smith, M.D.</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P>

<h3><center>GREED vs HEALTH Which Will Win?</center></h3>
<h4>by Dr. Lendon Smith</h4><P>
<pre>
I knew there was something wrong with aspartame (ASP, Nutrasweet /Equal),
but I could not quite put my finger on it.  Yes, the ingredients are
chemicals found naturally in foods, but is a little different when it is
ingested as a sweetner with little or no "food" around it. I just received
an eye-opener called "THE DEADLY DECEPTION," compiled by the ASPARTAME
CONSUMER SAFETY NETWORK (ACSN, PO Box 780634, Dallas, TX  75378.)  Founded
in 1987, it serves as a support group and clearinghouse for vital
information.  One of the opening pages hit me:

"85% of all complaints registered with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) concerns aspartame's adverse reactions."

It is now reported that FIVE DEATHS and at least 70 different symptoms have
resulted from its use.  The list includes neurological, dermatological,
cardiac, respiratory  all the symptoms I have ever seen reported for food
sensitivities, low blood sugar, Alzheimer's, Chronic Fatique syndrome,
amalgam-filling disease and methanol poisoning.  The Searle Pharmaceutical
Company has actually covered up or, at the very least, failed to report
adverse reactions just so the FDA would allow this product to be used by
millions worldwide.  Aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanyl-methyl-ester) is
about 200 times as sweet as sugar with virtually no calories.  It sounds
ideal for those who need to have the sweet taste, but not the calories.

This compound breaks down in the system to:
1) phenylalanine (50%) which can be neurotoxic and in some susceptible
people will cause seizures
2)  aspartic acid (40%) which can cause brain damage in the developing brain
3) methanol (10%) which turns into formaldehyde  embalming fluid  an
obvious toxin.

They all have adverse effects, but not everyone is affected equally.  This
is why the scientific community is having trouble evaluating these
anecdotal reports.  But I think you can see why Searle and the FDA have
minimized the adverse reactions;  there might be a loss of revenue.The
symptoms easily might lead a doctor to make a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue
Syndrome.  These chemicals "change the ratio of the amino acids in the
blood stream."

  The MENTAL SYMPTOMS that ASP can produce in a person is thought to be
related to the increase in violence and suicides in our population.  ASP
causes a blockage of the formation of serotonin in the brain. Since
tryptophan has been taken off the market by the FDA, there are many people
who cannot make enough serotonin from their food, and they are more
suseptible to insomnia, depression, and/or PMS.  If these genetically
deficient people are also swallowing ASP, they will more readily have
headaches, insomnia, depression, hostility, anxiety, and a host of other
negative symptoms.  No wonder sales of the new drug, Prozac, have
skyrocketed. ASP is known to disturb thyroid function.  The pituitary uses
serotonin as its neurotransmitter to tell the thyroid what to do.  ASP will
inhibit the formation of that neurotransmitter.  It can do anything.  These
ingredients may not actually cause mental problems but can certainly
trigger them by interferring with the ratio of the various brain
neurotransmitters.  It is the same with sugar, additives, alcohol, or food
sensitivities.  A person may be susceptible to brain chemical alterations,
but the reaction only occurs when there is stress plus the ingestion of
ASP.

MARY NASH STODDARD, who heads up the ACSN, has been diagnosed with that
devastating EMS
(EosinophiliaMyalgia Syndrome) because of her severe generalized aches and
an elevated eosinophil count.  When she stopped the ASP the disease
disappeared. (And we all thought that disease was only due to the tainted
tryptophan from the Japanese company.) The FDA and Searle (the Nutrasweet
Co.) claim that all the symptoms reported are just anecdotal, and these
people should see their doctor for a definitive diagnosis. (most of them
have, and the doctor could not name the disease.)  Three out of five of the
negative responders have headaches, to the point of being diagnosed as
migraines.This company feels that because so many millions of doses are
being taken everyday and the numbers of reactions are so few, ASP is very
safe as a sugar substitute.  But if people are using ASP as a sugar
substitute they are living in a fools' paradise.  Research has shown that
most people who are sensitive to ASP will notice an increase in hunger
pangs.  The blood sugar actually falls when the sweet taste in the mouth
from the ASP send a message to the brain that some sugar is going down the
gullet, and the pancreas better kick in with some extra insulin.I think
that most intelligent people might notice that they do not feel good after
drinking ASP loaded drinks and just quit the stuff.  When the symptoms
disappear, we would not necessarily call Searle or the FDA.  Many people
cannot drink red wine, or eat chocolate, but they do not call the companies
or sue the grocer.

"The Deadly Deception" cites chapter and verse of the coverup by Searle and
the FDA. Here are some highlights from the book "The Deadly Deception":

1969 - Dr. Harry Waisman fed ASP mixed with milk to monkeys.  One died
after 300 days of ASP and five others had grand mal seizures.  Searle
deleted this negative study when the company submitted safety evidence to
the FDA.

1970 - The FDA banned cyclamate during the time that the safety of
saccharin was being questioned.  The time seemed ripe for ASP.

1971 - Dr. John Olney, a research psychiatrist, told Searle that aspartic
acid caused "holes in the brains of mice."

1974 - Searle people said these studies raised "no health problems."
Searle told the FDA about these findings after approval was granted.

1975 - Many of the test animals fed ASP developed large TUMORS.  These were
NOT reported to the FDA.

1977 -  Despite the many complaints about ASP, William Conlon and Thomas
Sullivan, the US attorneys, took no action, in five years the statute of
limitations for a grand jury investigation expired.  A year later Conlon
took a position with the law firm that represents Searle. (U.S. Attorney,
Samuel Skinner did the same and ended up Chief of Staff in Bush's White
House. ed.)

1980 - A Public Board of Inquiry of three scientists was activated.  These
(2 MDs and one PhD) voted to ban ASP.  Because of those negative findings a
five member Commissioner's Team of Scientists was impaneled: Three said
ban; two said it was safe.  Another member was added.  You guessed it:
deadlock. Dr. Jacqueline Verrett, PhD, toxicologist on the team said,
"Bureau officials were working up to a whitewash.  Safety questions remain
unanswered."

1981 - Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr. was appointed the new FDA Commissioner
and overuled the Public Board of Inquiry's recommended ban of ASP.  He said
his approval was part of the Reagan administration's new reform! Throughout
the 1980's Searle has pointed out that the best evidence of ASP's safety
was the fact that it had been approved in more than 60 countries.  But
these foreign approvals had been based on these controversial test, and the
questionable approval of the FDA. It was approved as a "food additive," and
hence, exempt from continued safety monitoring. (Searle is not obligated to
monitor any adverse reactions.)

1983 - THE NATIONAL SOFT DRINK ASSOCIATION wrote to the FDA that ASP was
breaking down in warm climates.  But the Association later accepted ASP.
Dr. Hayes office approved the use of ASP in soft drinks just two months
before he quit his job as FDA chief.  He then obtained a job with a public
relations firm who represents NutraSweet.

1984 - Seven million pounds of NutraSweet are swallowed by about 100,000 peo=
ple.

1985 - Reports of side-effects mount.

1987 - ACSN is founded by Mary Nash Stoddard and consumer advocate, James
Turner.  They believe ASP should be recalled and retested as a drug.

(Also, former US Atty. prosecuting G.D. Searle for falsifying original
tests, recused himself at the last minute, taking a position with Sidley &
Austin, Searle's lawfirm. He was later appointed head of the Dept. of
Transportation, over the FAA, and then moved into position of Chief of
Staff in Bush's White House. Skinner was honored by the Epilepsy Foundation
in Chicago as their man-of-the-year. Former MONSANTO ATTORNEY, JUDGE
CLARENCE THOMAS was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, amidst swirling
controversy. Ed.)

A grass-roots effort to stop the use of ASP would be like us common folk
trying to get Columbia to stop producing heroin. If we can't get Searle to
stop (because it is big bucks for them) we can at least ask our patients
and friends to STOP USING IT IF THEY HAVE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS:

Headaches
Nausea
Vertigo
Hearing Loss
Tinnitus
Insomnia
Numbness of Extremities
Blurred Vision
Blindness/Eye Problems
Memory Loss
Slurred Speech
Mild to Suicidal Depression
Personality Changes
Mood Changes
Anxiety Attacks
Hyperactivity (child or adult)
Gastrointestinal Disorders
Seizures
Skin Lesions
Muscle Cramps
Joint Pain
=46atigue
PMS
Menstrual Irregularities
Chest Pain
Arrythmia
Edema
Increased Appetite

Sensitive people would more likely notice the connection between ingestion
and symptoms.  Some people do not notice anything until they stop taking
ASP in any form, and then they feel marvelous.

Death is also listed as a symptom.

ASPARTAME MAY TRIGGER OR MIMIC THE FOLLOWING ILLNESSES:

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
Epstein-Barr
Post-Polio Syndrome
Lyme Disease
Meniere's Disease
Alzheimer's Disease
ALS
Epilepsy
Multiple Sclerosis
EMS
Hypothyroidism
Mercury Sensitivity from Amalgam Fillings
(add: Fibromyalgia, Graves, Lupus, non Hodgkins Lymphoma, ADD as well. Ed.)

These are more than allergies or sensitivities.  We're talking about ASP
actually producing diseases, or disease syndromes.How does one take Searle
to court for damages? Are there more suicides now because tryptophan is not
available?  ASP causes a blockage of levels of serotonin which is the brain
chemical made from tryptophan.  We get tryptophan and its end product,
serotonin, if we eat a decent diet, but if we add ASP, we may not be able
to make enough serotonin to keep us from the above symptoms.  It was
discovered long ago that serotonin is lower in the brains of the depressed
than in the brains of those not so.  Mary Coleman, MD, in the Jr Peds, 78:
985-990, wrote way back in 1971 that the serotonin concentration in the
blood platelets of hyperactive kids was lower than in the not so active.
The hyperactivity of the children became less as the serotonin levels rose.
Vitamin B6 will help to raise the serotonin.

What about this connection:  The National Cancer Institute has discovered
an increased incidence of malignant brain tumors in the years following the
1983 licensing of ASP for beverages.  In the research on rats ingesting ASP
back in the early 1970's, brain tumors were observed.Doctors are not
helpful to their patients who complain of the above symptoms because the
connection with symptoms and aspartame are anecdotal and there are no tests
for the condition except the improvement when ASP is discontinued. Dr. Paul
Toft, a chiropractor from Alexandria, Minnesota, felt awful until he
stopped ASP.  He finds that the media will not touch this controversy,
because, as we all might suspect, it will definitely hurt advertising
revenue.Can you get your patients and friends to write for "The Deadly
Deception," and then do what you can to stop this menace?  The Nutrasweet
people have a commercial on TV bragging that they now have 200,000,000
people consuming the ASP in over 4,000 different products. ("That many
people couldn't be wrong!")  Next time you're mugged ask the perpetrator if
he is getting ASP; or when you see someone sitting on the sidewalk, tired,
alone and depressed, ask him if he is drinking soft drinks.  Chances are,
ASP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF SICKNESS AND CRIME.  It is not what Mother
Nature wants us to eat.

<font size=+1>WHAT DO THE EXPERTS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MINERALS?</font>
<p>
Senate Document 264/74th Congress, 2nd Session tells us:
<p>
<blockquote>
"...the alarming fact is that food (in America) no longer contain enough of our major
needed minerals and are starving us, no matter how much we eat!  99% of the American
people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the major minerals
results in DISEASE."
</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Linus Pauling, winner of 2 Nobel Prizes states:
<p>
<blockquote>
"You can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment to a mineral deficiency."
</blockquote>
<br>
This is powerful information that cannot be ignored.  
<br>
Dr. Robert LaFave, Metabolic Research Center also said:
<p>
<blockquote>
"...the beginning of debilitating disease starts with the demineralization of the body.
Without these minerals it is impossible for the regeneration process to occur."
</blockquote>
<p>
Also he stated:
<p>
<blockquote>
"None of the functions within the cell can occur without ALL of the minerals and trace
minerals being present."
</blockquote>
<p>
"The questions is...where can we obtain all of these minerals and trace minerals in a
proper balance and know that the body will be able to assimilate all of them immediately?
Until recently this has not been possible!  Thank Goodness, there now is a product
available...containing over 65 major and trace minerals from a totally natural source in
the balance that the body is readily able to use.  Clark's Original Mineral Formula has a
fantastic ability to help reestablish the very delicate balance in and around the cell...so
that the enzymes can bring about the regeneration process."

<font size=+1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</font>
<p>
<b>QUESTION: WHAT ARE COLLOIDAL MINERALS?</b>
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> A colloid is a particle substance that retains its identity and remains
in suspension.  Colloids are very small in size and therefore easily absorbed by the cells
of the body.  Plants convert metallic minerals into this form.  Dr. Carey Reams, a well
known biophysicist and biochemist, discovered that colloids can get so small they can
go through glass.  And that even within these plants colloids there can be a "solar
system" of different minerals. Dr. Reams maintains that the body requires 84 of the known
106 elements.  Colloidal biochemistry is a very neglected branch of science and
much research has yet to be done into the exact function of all the various elements.
<p>
<b>QUESTION : WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COLLOIDAL, METALLIC, AND CHELATED
MINERALS?</b>
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> One of the greatest differences is the absorbability level.  Regular
metallic minerals are only about 8-12% absorbable.  Chelated minerals are bound with an
amino acid and are only about 40-50% absorbable while the colloidal minerals are 98%
absorbable.  The high absorbability of these plant derived colloidal minerals is due to the
negative electrical charge they carry, while other minerals carry a positive charge.  The
T.J. Clark source of colloidal minerals is from an ancient organic rain forest deposit.
This plant source eliminates the danger of harmful toxins building up in the body tissues,
as may be the case with minerals from other sources.
<p>
<b>QUESTION: WHAT ABOUT MINERALS THAT ARE GENERALLY THOUGHT OF AS TOXIC?</b>  
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> Colloidal minerals as found in plants, are not toxic, in fact are very 
beneficial. For example, aluminum (which makes up about 30% of the Earth's crust) is found
in many foods.  However, in its metallic form it can be harmful.  The Harvard Medical 
Newsletter finally published the fact that none of the investigating laboratories had
differentiated the form that the aluminum was in and the controversy over aluminum has
since ceased.  The same is true of arsenic, iodine, lead, mercury and other mineral 
elements.  In their colloidal form they are needed by the body in trace amounts.  In other
words, microgram amounts.  A microgram is only one millionth of a gram.
<p>
The Clark colloidal plant-source minerals were tested in Germany by Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp, 
Nobel Prize nominee in biophysics.  His tests revealed that the product was not only 
completely non-toxic, but increased the life (electrical) energy output of cells beyond
what we had previously established as optimum.  He congratulated us on the excellence of
the product.  
<p>
<b>QUESTION: ARE RIPPLE CREEK  COLLOIDAL MINERALS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COLLOIDAL MINERAL
PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET?</b>
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> Yes, substantially different for several reasons.  Number one, and
probably the most important difference is the source.  The deposit that was discovered in
1920 by Thomas Clark was determined to be the mineral remains of an ancient rain forest,
determined by the U.S. Dept.  of Interior to be from the Cretaceous Period, approximately
60 million to 127 million years old.  This period is characterized by the development of
flowering plants and the disappearance of dinosaurs.  These minerals were preserved because
of a unique set of circumstances.  Covering the pressure that would have altered the form
of the minerals.  At the bottom of the deposit is a very hard bed of clay which allowed the
minerals to collect and prevented them from leaching through and simply disappearing.
Selections from various parts of the deposit are used to insure a balance of the various
minerals used to produce RIPPLE CREEK  COLLOIDAL MINERALS.  
<p>
The minerals are extracted with pure, cool clear water to the desired concentration and
then processed through a complex array of special filters to allow only the organic 
colloidal minerals in the final solution.  There are no preservatives, flavorings, or
synthetic substances added.
<p>
Presently, the 75 year old T.J. Clark mine is the only one of its kind that has been 
discovered, and no other persons or companies have mineral rights to it.  In an effort to
imitate the Clark Mine Formula, there are companies who are using a similar story and
making false and misleading claims.  Inorganic or certain metallic mineral ingredients can
be harmful.
<p>
<b>QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY OTHER IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES?</b>
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> Yes, the RIPPLE CREEK  COLLOIDAL MINERALS have a natural negative
electrical charge.  This has two very important benefits.  One, it greatly enhances the
transport and availability of other nutrients gotten from foods and/or vitamins and other
supplements.  And two, it will attract toxins and heavy metals from the body and flush them
out.  A simple test of this may be done with a glass of ordinary tap water or some of the
so-called mineral waters on the market.  Pour in about an ounce of the RIPPLE CREEK  
COLLOIDAL MINERALS and it will immediately cloud up.  After an hour or two, there will be
sediment of the impurities at the bottom.  Done with distilled (pure) water, the Clark
minerals stay in suspension and the water remains clear.  
<p>
<b>QUESTION: HOW LONG WILL THE MINERAL SUPPLY LAST?</b>  
<br><b>ANSWER:</b> That, of course depends on the volume that the T.J. Clark mine is
producing, which has markedly increased.  However, their projections, taking into account
the increasing demand, is approximately two to three hundred years.

<H3>The Story</H3>

<A HREF="clear01.htm">Harmony</A>, <A HREF="clear02.htm">Experience</A> and <A HREF="clear03.htm">Clear</A> come directly to North America from overseas. The recipes for both herbal food combinations are treasures which have been in the same family for hundreds of years.<P>

   In a small village, the Aboukhazaal family was known for its special skills and knowledge of herbs. Secrets about the way herbs worked were passed down from generation to generation, to a designated heir. Ahmad Aboukhazaal was picked at the age of 4 by his master herbalist father from among 10 siblings to learn the family secrets about the ancient herbal recipes. While other children were outside playing, Ahmad was at his father's side, learning about the wonder of herbs.<P>

   The family home functioned as an open clinic to which people came from all over the region, seeking herbal remedies and advice. The clinic was open 24 hours a day, and there were often line-ups of patients outside. But there was never any charge for consultation with Ahmad or his father; they saw people solely out of a sincere desire to help. Both believed that one receives in the same proportion as one gives. After many years, and after the death of his father, Ahmad began running the family practice alone.<P>

   Because Harmony, Experience and Clear come from ancient family recipes that must be handled with care and concern, Ahmad provides personal attention in manufacturing the products.  The recipe for Harmony is documented as being 285 years old;  the recipe for Experience is more than 100 years old; and the recipe for Clear is over 600 years old.  The secret of these recipes is in the blending of ingredients; all ingredients must be balanced and harmonized with each other for maximum results and benefits to the human body.<P>

   Western society in the 1990s is out of balance. Only now are people beginning to rediscover and embrace much of the wisdom of the past. Ahmad's ancient family recipes are part of that wisdom.  By sharing them with the world, Awareness Corporation is giving people the chance to be part of the rediscovery of balanced and harmonious life.<P>

<H3>The Importance of Balance</H3>

The herbal ingredients of <A HREF="clear01.htm">Harmony</A>, <A HREF="clear02.htm">Experience</A> and <A HREF="clear03.htm">Clear</A> come from plants which are alive and full of energy. The secret of blending the ingredients of Harmony and Experience is to balance and harmonize the different energies with each other. Once all the ingredients are in balance, they can provide benefits to the human body which works best when it is properly balanced.<P>

Balance is the principle on which the entire universe is founded. But Western society in the 1990s is becoming unbalanced. Only now are people beginning to rediscover and embrace much of the wisdom of the past, including the wisdom about balance and harmony. Ahmad's ancient family recipes are part of that wisdom, and by sharing them with the world, Awareness Corporation is giving people the chance to be part of the rediscovery.<P>

Perhaps the best thing about the products is that they are very easy to use. Harmony, for example, is as easy as making tea. And Experience can be taken as a tea or a capsule. Clear can be taken easily in the form of a capsule. The products will not further complicate anyone's already complex lives; they can actually help simplify life, as their benefits can be far-reaching.<P>

<h2><center>Product Testimonials</center></h2>
"I got started on the HARMONY and EXPERIENCE about a month ago and 
I am pleased with both products. I became regular like it said on the
 video right away. When I take HARMONY I sleep like a baby, it's great. 
I now have more energy and can sleep more soundly.  
And I have been on CLEAR about three weeks. Actually within a couple of 
hours of taking CLEAR I felt some sensations down in my bowels. 
 Three days later when I came out of the washroom my wife
 said I was pale and looked like I'd seen a ghost. 
To me it was almost the same because I'd passed a 14 inch tapeworm. 
And I didn't talk about it for a couple of days to be honest with you. 

 I was a little bit shaken up by it. There have been all kinds of other 
little ones that have come out.<P>

"Another benefit is that every morning I used 
to wake up with stiff joints - my knuckles and my wrists, in particular.
 With CLEAR all my joints feel like they are all lubricated. My wife Deann just
 pulled me into the washroom yesterday and said "Look at this!" She
passed a 7 inch tapeworm and she has been passing parasites
everyday now for almost two weeks. What really has surprised me about this
 whole thing is that for the last year, we have been vegetarians.
We are very health conscious and we watch
everything that we eat. So when Deann and I both passed these 
parasites, it was shocking at first and quite surprising."<br>
<i>Cameron H.,</i> British Columbia<p>




"What I wanted to really express here is that prior to going on 
Awareness Products, I had gone on Dr. Bernard Jensens' Cleanse.  I 
had 4 or 5 of those treatments but I didn't have too
 much success. Ken came by and gave me some
 CLEAR and I started on that. Two days into that I passed a
 7 inch tapeworm. That really blew my mind because I figured I didn't
 have anything in me. And I'd passed another couple of little things that 
are really white and fat. They are about an inch long got a
 little curl to them. I've been around 
this for 30 years now,working with cleansing and rebuilding and have seen
 some parasites, but to me this is unbelievable. It just blows my mind."<br>
<i>Ben W.</i><p>


"I've been using the HARMONY and EXPERIENCE for 16 months. 
Since I have been using the products, I have lost 35 pounds. I lost 5
 inches off my waist. I used to take medications for an acute sinus
condition and for a hiatal hernia. In the last 16 months, I have
not had to take any medications and I have not had a reoccurrence of either one of
these two symptoms. I have been on the CLEAR product for approximately
 a month now. 
Some of the things that have been happening to me are absolutely incredible.
 My eyes have cleared up tremendously. I have noticed parasites in my stool. 
I had no idea, that I had any parasites at all. All in all, I feel 
wonderful. I'm looking forward to staying on these products forever.<br>
<i>Al K.,</i> Ontario Canada.<p>



"My wife, Rill and I were very happy to find the products HARMONY,
EXPERIENCE, and CLEAR. In practice, we use a form of chiropractic
 called "Network Spinal Analysis" and it is a whole body approach to 
wellness. These products have come along just at the right time. 
Within the first couple of days of taking CLEAR, any area that I would
 sweat would become intensely itchy like something was going on. 
I also had a couple of sensations in my scalp as if there were bugs
crawling on it. And this lasted a couple of days and then subsided. 
As a result of taking Clear was all sugar cravings totally subsided. 
My one weakness has always been sugar. And since being on CLEAR 
 I really don't feel like having desserts. 
CLEAR  assists a person in becoming more whole by utilizing a food 
substance which is natural and organic.  
As a chiropractor, people come to me for help.
Now I can say,"Hey, this is a new product try it." 
It is easy and simple and gets results.
We can't keep the stuff in the office."<br>
<i>Vincent M.</i><p>
     

"For many years, I have known that toxicity and parasites are the two 
major causes of illness. I have searched the world for an  effective colon
 cleanser and parasite formula. EXPERIENCE is the only true colon cleanser
 I've found. It dissolves encrusted fecal matter and strengthens the muscle
 tone of the colon. I've seen that people are able to take less of 
EXPERIENCE after being on it for a certain length of time specific for 
their particular condition.
Therefore, I know it is a super effective colon cleanser.
 The parasite formulas, I've used previously have only killed a few parasites;
mostly those in the intestinal tract. Because parasite testing
is so inadequate, it is difficult for people to understand that we all 
have parasites. CLEAR kills the parasites in our bodies. And it kills the
 parasites throughout our bodies not just those in the
intestinal tract. Imagine all the years I have been searching and how 
ecstatic I am to find a true colon cleanser and a parasite formula that is
 super effective in the same company: AWARENESS.<P>

"I want to tell you about a woman who called me recently. Her son 
 suddenly got very sick. He was very athletic, very active, very
healthy - seemed to be anyway. He became very sick and the doctor said to 
take a stool sample and bring it to him. In his stool, his mother saw worms
 moving around. The results of the stool sample were taken at the lab. They
were negative. She called and wanted to know why that is. This tells
me what I have known all along: parasite testing is very inadequate.
Using HARMONY along with EXPERIENCE and CLEAR has produced amazing 
results. People are truly grateful and express their appreciation
 often for these unique products."<br>

"I'm the administrative Coordinator of Perioperative Services. My experience
 with HARMONY and EXPERIENCE has to do with my father in law. 
At one time he was very ill.  He had circulatory problems in his legs.
He was unable to walk properly he had to be put
into a wheel chair. We went out walking for a long distance he could not
 sleep. His pain was too great. His legs would jump at random, waking him
 up at night. And since he has been taking HARMONY and 
EXPERIENCE now for these past 3 months, the jumping in his legs
stopped.  He has no more pain, and he is able to commute without using a 
wheel chair now.  He occasionally uses a cane. It is unbelievable."<br>
<i>Frank F.</i><p>



"Over a period of time I have been able to test products through some
instrumentation that I use to find out if a product will benefit 
or be a detriment to our health. What I have found about HARMONY and 
EXPERIENCE and CLEAR is that everyone tests very very strongly. 
I have tested thousands of products on the market in the past
 and most of them are of no value at all.  30% of the products that are of
 value tend to be only of value to about 30% of the people that I have tested. 
Now in order to substantiate some of my findings I took them to
 professionals to have them tested as well. 
One in particular really amazed me when she gave me the results. 
She uses electronic equipment. She sits in front
of a box that has about 90 dials. If the reading is negative, obviously
 it is detrimental to a person's
health so she certainly would not recommend the product. 
If it is positive, and if it reaches 100 then she recommends it.
 400 is considered excellent. When she tested the CLEAR, the HARMONY, and 
the EXPERIENCE with this instrumentation, she found they were reading 
any where from 7,000 to 60,000 on people! This means it is an exceptionally
 excellent product for people to use and get benefits from."<br>

"I used to have bronchial asthma for many many years, and I always take
medicine like Provonthil then sometimes I take steroids. Many times I have
been in the hospital because of severe bronchial asthma. I also had
diabetes. I could not accept the fact that I would
 take medicine all my life. So I looked for an alternative.  When I tried
these products, HARMONY, and EXPERIENCE after
 just one week, my blood glucose went back to normal levels.
I took it with Accutec for about a week and then it was within normal limits.
CLEAR was introduced to me and I've taken
 it for almost 3 months. I've felt more alert and I've been more 
active. The feeling of fatigue that I used to experience before I took 
these three products is not there any more.  I feel so great taking
 CLEAR. I truly could recommend a product like CLEAR to a 
lot of people especially in underdeveloped countries. They need it more 
here because there is a lot of microscopic parasites that make you feel
 very bad, the tapeworm, pin worms, and many more organisms."<br>
<i>Dr. McC.,</i> Surgeon<P>

"I've had a lot of health problems. I've had 23 operations major and 
minor. I have a lot of respect for and I'm very grateful to the medical
 profession but I also knew that I would have to
do something about my own health. It was time to take care of it. 
So when I first started on EXPERIENCE, the first 7 days, I lost 7 Ibs. That
 in itself excited me. Up to date, from EXPERIENCE and HARMONY,
 I've lost 20 lbs. I've had a heart condition that has
improved. A hypoglycemic, my sugar level is now level; my thyroid gland is
 normal. I had dermatitis that was really severe because I was going 
through a jar of cortisone cream a week. It cost $50 a jar.
I had been doing that for the past two years. I put some HARMONY
in foot bath and after 3 times and I haven't had a problem with my feet
 since. When I started on CLEAR, the first time that I went to the washroom 
I noticed weird looking things that looked like bugs with legs on them. 
The first time that happened, there were several (12 - 15). 
 But last week, I called my husband in to the washroom I said, "Mack, 
you've got to come and see this because I
can't believe this I don't know how to explain them."<br>
<i>Della</i><p>



"I have a natural healing clinic with my fiance Andrea, I've been 
a vegetarian for 23 years had done many cleanses. 
I did colonic irrigation over a year and a half period. I had done a
colonic with my fiance and we were surprised because we ran twenty gallons
 through my bowels and nothing came out.  When I started on EXPERIENCE,
 within my first four days I was very surprised to find that I had
 multicolored stripes of black material through my
stools and I was really quite surprised and overwhelmed by the results
 of the product. Back in September, I started putting our clients in
 the clinic on the EXPERIENCE and HARMONY products. We have now over 100
 clients and we have had dramatic results from all of them. 
We are now having these people coming to us daily and we are filling them
in on the CLEAR product and this is just the next step. My fiance Andrea 
is a doctor of Acupuncture, a doctor of Homeopathy. She has been a colon
 therapist for three years and has done literally
thousands of colon therapies on people as well as herself.
 and I'd like her to share her experiences with HARMONY, EXPERIENCE and 
especially the CLEAR in her first week of taking the product."<BR>
<i>Scott D.</i><p>



"Hello, everybody.  CLEAR is definitely the Product that made me
release worms and parasites much more than any other product. It seems
to do the job really accurately and efficiently compared to all the
 other products. This seems to really hit the spot with my clients, as well.
As soon as I started CLEAR, after 2 - 3 days, I really started releasing
 10 different parasites. And after a week, at least 20 different kinds. 
All different sizes and shapes -  I didn't even have to try
to identify them. It was very very obvious. This is it, you need to do 
this and it is simple and it is effective. People want results and they 
are getting it, so just stay with it. You need to commit and what are you
 committing to in life, is what is most important,
You heal from the inside out."<BR>

"When I started HARMONY and EXPERIENCE I was so delighted because I had
 had a long standing problem with constipation. I was using up to 8 laxatives
a day for 40 years and I thought that I would never be able to get off them. 
And now I'm off them completely. My bowel movements are much more regular 
and I have increased energy. I've no further bloating and this has
 gotten even better now that I am on CLEAR. The other thing that I have
 noticed when I was on HARMONY and EXPERIENCE was my sustained energy for
 sports. I'm 63 now, but when I go down to Barbados, I've
been able to run up and down hills up to 10 kilometers a day. And I just
can't wait to get out there which is a big difference. It wasn't a chore. 
In my 40 years of nursing, I had never really
considered that parasites were a problem, but I wanted to take the CLEAR.
 I had taken another parasite cleanse before, about 6 months ago and I had
 noticed nothing. When I started on CLEAR I certainly did pass some
 parasites. Well after all these years of nursing, I
am really excited that I have found these products that are natural. 

They are focused on cleansing and rebuilding and I'm really excited about
 promoting them with the people that I am in contact with."<BR>
<i>Margaret C.</i><p>




"We have started some of our patients on HARMONY and EXPERIENCE and we
did have positive results. We have patients on chronic constipation and
they seem to have improved with regulating bowel movements. Some patients
with irritable bowel syndrome also had some decrease in their symptoms
 including abdominal spasms. They have decreased their intake of
 some of their antacid as well as anti-spasmodic  medications.
Overall, HARMONY and EXPERIENCE did help our patients with specific
 medical problems."<br>
<i>Alex G., MD</i><p>
       



"Both my son and I started on CLEAR. My son is 13 and I started him on just
one capsule thinking that was what he would need. I started with two and
 I had to eliminate suddenly in the afternoon. It was about 10 hours after
 I had taken the product and I knew it had
 to have something to do with CLEAR. It was an unusual elimination.
The texture was very fine as if there was a lot of little tiny eggs or 
little tiny worms, I couldn't tell. The next day, my son took two and he
 passed parasites that night as well.
The second day that I took it, I passed parasites that were
about as long as the width of a quarter and they were like a 
triangular shape and they had little feelers on them. They had eyes because
 I got brave and fished out four of them from
the toilet. That very first day I said to my son, "Do you know
something? I feel good. I can't explain it. I just feel good."
 And the next day when these other things came out, I
felt, all of a sudden, bathroom I felt invigorated and
that is the only way that I can explain it."<br>
<I> Darlene McC.</I> <p>





"I'm a diabetic. I started taking CLEAR about probably 3 or 4 months ago
 and initially I didn't see much change but after probably the fourth month
 my blood sugar went down to levels I have not experienced in the past.
 it was way down into the levels of 4 and 5 which on a morning blood test
 is quite unusual for me. Usually I am in the range of
 probably 8 or 9 and sometimes 10. If I can keep it in that level,
 I'm happy. I know that there were parasites in my body that were 
taken out by CLEAR and I am going to benefit from it.
I am a veterinarian and I feel these products are going
to do some amazing things for getting rid of parasites in animals.
There are parasites in animals and birds
that we are not able get rid of with current medications. If
people want to treat their animals with non-chemical
 medications or products that don't
contain harsh chemicals, this is going to be a God-send.
 And I think that we are going to see
some dramatic results once these products get into universal
 use and into the mainstream of veterinary medicine."<br>
<i>Dean A., DVM</i><p>



"I've got to tell you when I first learned about these products I 
immediately wanted to try them. Because I knew innately there was something
that I had to get from them.
At the time I was experiencing a hair loss. It would kind of clump up
in the drain after my morning shower. After about a month on the product
that completely stopped. I also found that I had a better, more restful
 sleep and a desire to eat more wholesome
types of food - especially more grains and I was never a big grain person.
The one thing that has really amazed me is that after having our second son
15 months ago, I haven't really been able to get back to a major exercise
 program. When people see me, they will say 'You look fantastic and your 
stomach is so flat, what are you doing for it?'<P>

"And I'm just doing HARMONY, and EXPERIENCE. The other thing I noticed which
 truly amazes me is the cellulite behind my thighs is disappearing in a
 very big way. I thought that was something
I was going to always have to live with. I think for me, as a busy 
practitioner, running a practice, treating patients, a busy mom with a 
four year old and a 15 month old, I find that I have
such an increased focus. The ability for me to do a lot of different tasks
 under pressure and get them done with a smile on my face is just
 something that I have never had the ability
to do before. As a health care practitioner, we receive at least 10 - 15
 tapes monthly on all different types of products that are out on the
 market. It didn't make sense to me to have
people spending lots of money on different nutritional aides and food 
products if their body was not going to properly absorb these products or
 these parasites were going to benefit before we do.
It's very easy for me to recommend this product to patients. It's a cost 
effective program. It's easy for them to take and people have very 
good results with their proper commitment to the

<A NAME="Introduction">Welcome</A> to ALL CREATURES! Our goal is to help people help themselves <B><I>and</I></B> their animal companions be  healthy...naturally. Here you can learn about and purchase a wide variety of  alternative health care products, holistic services, handmade art pieces,  books and tapes for you and your animals all in one convenient "store."
<P>
All of our products, from pet toys and supplies, and pet food to  nutritional supplements, including joint rehabilitation therapies, are safe, durable and non-toxic, and contain only the finest natural ingredients without by-products, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives, and are cruelty-free. Our arts and crafts are dramatic and humorous animal reproductions. You can even consult privately with our own holistic "win-win" attorney, nutritional consultant and animal behaviorist!
<P>
Our basic <I>nutritional</I> tenets for you and your animal companions are quite simple: You ARE what you eat. Eat and drink only from non-leaded glass like Pyrex (tm). Unless you live in a truly pristine area, upstream from the cattle crossing, drink only filtered or bottled water, preferably distilled. Eat only natural, organically grown foods.
<P>
Do you have any questions or comments regarding  companion animals,  holistic legal or  health care, nutrition or animal behavior?  We would enjoy hearing from you and will try to respond either directly or through our  Newsletter. 
<P>
Keep visiting our store...updated at least monthly, and be certain to check out our Hot Links to related sites and internet tools and search engines. <P>

<p><a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> is an electro-stimulation unit which applies electrical pulses to
predetermined <a href="acupct.html">acupuncture points</a>.  It is <b>safe</b> - <b>drug-free</b> - with
<b>no side effects</b>, and <b>easy to use</b>. <br>
This compact, highly effective, hand held unit incorporates a detection device which quickly locates the precise
treatment points on the body to enable treatment.  These are then stimulated by mild electronic pulses
(<b>no needles</b>), all at the touch of a button.  <br>
It simultaneously provides <b>rapid</b>,<b> long lasting pain relief</b> and also appears to be effective in
accelerating tissue repair and regeneration by stimulating the body's own healing system.</p>

<center><a name="use"><h2>How to Use HealthPoint</h2></a></center>
<p>With the help of an illustrated manual and an audio-visual signal locate the <a href="acupct.html">
acupuncture points</a>.  Treatment usually takes no more than five minutes. <b>Relief of pain is immediate</b>
for a wide range of disorders including conditions which cause pain, stress, and other physical discomforts.</p>

<h4><a name="1">What is HealthPoint?</a></h4></center>
<p><a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> is a <b>safe</b>, easy-to-use, hand-held instrument which offers
<b>drug-free</b> pain relief and help for more than 150 common <a href="ailments.html">ailments</a>.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="2">How does it work?</a></h4></center>
<p><a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> locates and stimulates precise points which are linked to Bio-electrical
channels, called meridians, that run through our bodies.  These are linked to magnetic points called
<a href="acupct.html"> Acupuncture points</a> which stimulate the body's own healing system to function
correctly.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="3">What are <a href="acupct.html">acupuncture points</a></a>?</h4></center>
<p>Modern science has now shown that these points discovered by Chinese doctors thousands of years ago
are minute magnetic points with very low electrical resistance compared to normal skin (10:1).  These points
are all over the body and act like tiny switches when stimulated.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="4">How do you find the right point?</a></h4></center>
<p><a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> has a built-in detector that indicates with a light and a high-pitched
buzz when you have found the spot (within 0.5 mm).  You also feel a definite tingling sensation on the spot which
is your confirmation that you are on the right spot.  You should feel nothing otherwise.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="5">Is it difficult to use?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>NO</b>!  It may take a little bit of practice to start with, but <a href="kit.html">the unit</a> comes with a
good instruction video and a book showing all the treatment points. </p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="6">Does HealthPoint have to be applied by a trained specialist?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>NO</b>!  The advantage of <a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> is that it is a self-treat unit, which has
sophisticated technology enabling anybody to find the precise points to treat.  HealtPoint is NOT invasive -
it does not use needles, but a mild electronic impulse.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="7">Is it safe?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>YES</b>!  <a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> is completely safe - so safe that you can use it on anyone -
even young babies, the frail and the very old.  The only people that should take guidance on using HealthPoint
are those with a heart pacemaker and mothers in the early stages of pregnancy.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="8">Can you overdo it?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>NO</b>!  You can use <a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> as often and as long as you feel necessary - the
length and frequency of treatment will depend on the ailment yuo are treating and how badly you are suffering.
In the treatment of children it is recommended that the intensity is set to the lowest setting to avoid any distress.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="9">Is it effective?</a></h4></center>
<p>In about 80% of cases the patient will have a recovery or good relief.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="10">How long does it take to work?</a></h4></center>
<p>In many cases it can work within minutes of the first treatment.  Chronic problems may need daily treatment for
a month, but eventually may even disappear completely for up to two years before more treatment is needed.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="11">Is it like TeNS?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>NO</b>!  The TeNS machine, which is strapped on with sticky pads, uses electric current 3,000 times stronger than
HealthPoint and words by blocking pain signals to the brain, and as it works with the nervous system is only for
temporary relief of pain.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="12">Does HealthPoint just mask the pain?</a></h4></center>
<p><b>NO</b>!  <a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> stimulates the body's own healing system without the use of
drugs and helps re-start the healing process for the cause of the pain rather than just masking it. </p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="13">Does HealthPoint actually cure things or just relieve the pain?</a></h4></center>
<p>With acute and chronic problems conditions, the stimulation of the body's own healing system can often lead
to a full recovery.  </p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="14">How long does pain relief last?</a></h4></center>
<p>Pain relief can last for up to 24 hours between treatments.  Chronic pain such as <!--<a href="arthritis.html">-->
Arthritis can be pain-free for between six months and two years.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="15">Can I reach every point on my body?</a></h4></center>
<p><a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a>'s extension lead and probe mean you can reach almost everywhere,
even on your back.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a> 
<center><img src="images/line30.gif">
<h4><a name="16">What are the ear clips for?</a></h4></center>
<p>The ear (auricular) clips are to treat conditions such as <a href="misc5index.html">Stress</a>, Drug Addiction and
<a href="misc5index.html">Anxiety</a>.</p>
<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" border=0></a>

<h4><a name="18">What can be treated?</a></h4></center>
<p><a href="ailments.html">Over 150 conditions</a> are detailed in the manual; it is important that you have an
accurate diagnosis of your condition before you attempt treatment with HealthPoint.  Also see

<p>This form of treatment is being used by medical practitioners all over the world.  In  Great Britain, where
<a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a> is manufactured, it is already in use in hospitals, GP surgeries and

<p>"..to my surprise the knee was pain free.. It is the best thing I could ever have done.  Without exageration my
life has been changed." <b>M.C. Helip - Trauma Nursing Sister</b></p>
<p>"We are ausing HealthPoint on patients who have frozen shoulders, neck and back problems and chronic
ankle injuries.  Nine times out of ten it has worked."  <b>Physiotherapist</b></p>
<p>"I have been treating my father who has arthritis in hips and legs and he has felt great relief".
<b>L. Needham</b></p>
<p>"I have been very impressed by the outcome for patients with CFIDS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome).  I was so
excited by the results that this has now become our primary treatment for this condition."
<b> Hospital Clinician</b></p>
<p>"My continued use and pain free time in the first month from neck pain was brilliant, I expereinced other
equipment which makes similar claims - I have to tell you the HealthPoint is quite superior in hankling and results."
<b> A. McNabb</b></p>
<p>"I thought you would like to know how much help the HealthPoint has been with the arthritis in the knuckles of
my hands.  Since using the HealthPoint I haven't taken any drugs for this problem." <b> W. Maxwell </b>
<p>"My husband bought a HealthPoint.  I thought it was a waste of money.  He wanted to try it on an old rugby
injury which was stopping us rambling.  Having used it for a short time we are now, at 80 years old, back to
walking 7 miles.  I have Pruritis - I didn't know itching had a name.  After years of discomfort I have very little
signs of it". <b> A. Hall </b></p>
<p>"My specialist told me with 75% degeneration of the Discs there was nothing that could be done and I had to
live with the pain.  The physiotherapist at the hospital recommended HeatlhPoint... I can now garden, bowl, walk
for miles... all pain free". <b> L. Haslam</b> </p>

<a name=#history>
<p>Acupuncture is an ancient system of treatment.  It is part of the discipline of traditional Chinese medicine.  This
embraces many other forms of healing, quite apart from acupuncture, for example Chinese herbal medicine.
Acupuncture is not, nor has it ever been, a complete system of medicine in its own right.  It is, however, effective in
may conditions which have often not responded to conventional approaches.</p><br>
<p>Acupunture's main use is intreating chronic and painful conditions such as arthritis, headaches and migraines.
After dental caries (tooth decay) and the common cold, these are the most common afflictions of the human race.
Its effectiveness has enabled acupuncture to survive against, at times, enormous odds.  It was banned by law in
China at the beginning of this century but continued to be practiced as folk medicine.  Interest by Western doctors
in acupuncture was stimulated by President Nixon's visit to China in 1972.  Since that time medical interest in the
subject has grown apace, underpinned by a number of important discoveries pointing to the effectiveness of
Acupuncture.</p>
<center><img src=images/line30.gif></center>
<p>The ancient Chinese hypothesised that energy circulated in the body via specific channels, which they called
meridians.  They considered that the balance and transmission of this energy from side to side, top to bottom and
from the inside to the outside of the body was of great importance.  They expressed this idea using their doctrine
of Yin and Yang, which considers that everything is an amalgam of opposites (the opposited being called Yin or
Yang).  Yang was associated with activity, fire, the sunny side of a hill or the male principle and Yin was associated
with physical substance, water, the dark side of the hill or the female principle.  The balance between these two
opposites was considered to be constantly fluctuating, in other words it was a dynamic balance.  If one was out of
balance, in an energetic sense, the principle of treatment would be to re-establish that balance.</p><br>
<p>The Chinese had an essentially vitalistic approach to the body and its physiology in keeping with many ancient
systems of medicine.  It is interesting to reflect that modern Western medicine is the only such system ever to have
existed without a vitalistic approach to health and disease. </p><br>
<p>The Chinese developed a highly complex and sophisticated system of empirical laws based on countless
observations of illness and response to treatment.  These laws resulted in a number of ground rules aimed at guiding
a doctor to the improvement of his patient's condition.  The astonishing fact is that the application of these
apparently odd-sounding laws do appear to work in a highly significant proportion of patients.  It can clearly be
surmised that if it did no work, acupuncture would not have been adopted within both Western and Eastern cultures
to such a degree.</p><br>
<p>The Chinese believed that in addition to being in balance, the energy or life force (which the Chinese called chi)
had to be able to circulate freely around the meridians.  If a break occurred anywhere in this circulation, illness would
result.  An example is backache, wich is viewed by the Chinese as a blockage in the "chi" circulating in the bladder
meridian.  The remedy was, put in the simplest terms, to insert a needle at the point of discomfort, thus encouraging
flow to re-establish itself.  </p><br>
<p>Each meridian refers to a particular organ, and the energy flowing through that meridian can be taken as indicating
the functional state of that organ.  Inserting a needle into a point on the liver meridian for instance could be expected
to affect the function of the liver, the effect would depend on the actual point used and the state of the patient at the
time of treatment.</p><br><br>
<center><img src=images/line30.gif></center><br>
<p><b><a href="hpindex.html">HealthPoint</a></b> allows you, without the use of needles, to stimulate points at
which the energy flow is blocked.  Gently apply the tip of the probe to the points which hurt.  We call these "trigger
points", the Chinese call them "Ah-Shi" (practically translated "ouch") points.<br>
<b><a href="hpindex.html">HealthPoint</a></b> technique can be as effective as traditional needle acupuncture.</p>

<a href="#list">List of painful disorders</a><br><br>
<p>Pain is perhaps the most common of all conplaints and it can be divided into:
<ol>
<li>Acute (having been present for only a short time: say less than 2 weeks duration)
<li>Chronic (lasting more than 2 weeks)
</ol><br>
<center><img src="images/line30.gif"></center>
</p><center><h3>General Principles for the Use of the HealthPoint in Pain Relief</h3></center>
<ol>
<li>Always treat <a href="acupct.html" base target="INFOWIN">local tender points</a> which the Chinese call Ah Shi (literally
translated this means "ouch") points.
<li>In acute conditions treat daily, in some instances it is beneficial to treat hourly to begin with.  If discomfort
returns within a short period after treatment, repeat the treatment as often as necessary.
<li>In chronic conditions treat daily until the condition improves, then two or perhaps three times weekly.
Intervals between treatments can be increased as the condition further improves.

<a name="acne"><h3>Acne</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Acne eruptions are caused by problems with the skin's normal processes.  Pimples begin in the skin's hair
follicles, which are connected to oil-producing glands.  Normally the oil flows out of the hair follicle the the skin's
surface, carrying with it dead skin cells from the follicle lining.  During puberty, however, male sex hormones (which
are produced by both sexes) stimulate increased oil production.  In acne, the excess oil combines with the dead skin
cells, hair fragments, and bacteria to form plugs that block the follicle pore.  Once the plug forms, it may be pushed
to the skin surface and protrude slightly to form a blackhead.  Dirt does not cause blackheads.  Their dark color
comes from skin pigment mixed into the plug debris.  If the plug doesn't reach the skin's surface but continues to
grow in the follicle, it can rupture the follicle wall, discharging its mixture of oil, bacteria, and dead cells into the
surrounding tissue and causing a minor infection.  The result is a white-headed acne pimple.  </p><br>
<center><img src="images/line30.gif"></center>
<center><a name="eczema"><h3>Eczema</h3></a></center>
</center>
<p>Eczema is an allergic inflammation of the skin.   It commonly occurs in skin forlds such as the elbows and knees.
In many cases the causes of eczema are not known although stress, food sensitivity, excessive dry or humid climates
and inheritance seem to play a role.</p><br><br>

<a name="asthma"><h3>Asthma</h3></a><br>
</center>
<p>Asthma causes difficulty breathing, which usually means wheezing but may include coughing, shortness of
breath, and chest tightness.  Asthma involves the marrowing of the small airways in the lungs.  During asthma
attacks, the muscles around the bronchioles tighten, restricting the flow of air and making breathing difficult. <br>
<a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> can offer a successful approach to asthma and although many people
have successfully replaced all drugs with electro-acupuncture it should not be taken as a complete substitute for
drugs until definite progress is being made, and then only after consultation with your physician. </p>

<a name="bronchitis"><h3>Bronchitis</h3></a><br>
</center>
<p>Bronchitis is an inflammation of the major airways (bronchi).  The inflammation is typically caused by a virus
and aggravated by <!--<a href="smoking.html" base target="INFOWIN">-->cigarette smoke</a>, dusts, chemical vapors, and air pollution.
Occasionally bacteria cause this condition.</p>

<a name="cough"><h3>Cough</h3></a><br>
</center>
<p>A cough can be a symptom of an emormous number of illnesses.  Coughing is the respiratory tract's reflex

<a name="croup"><h3>Croup - Laryngeal Tracheaitis</h3></a><br>

<p>Croup is characterised by severe laryngeal spasm, causing great difficulty in breathing.  It is often due to a

<a name="bed"><h3>Bed-wetting - Enuresis</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Bed-wetting is largely a childhood problem, through disease and aging can cause loss of bladder control among
adults.  According to many pediatricians, bedwetting children often have unusually small bladder capacities.  This
doesn't mean their bladders are any smaller than those of non-bedwetters, only that they feel full with less urine.
In the vast majority of cases of chronic childhood bedwetting, the problem is not caused by any disease or physical
abnormality.  In cases where bedwetting begins after a dry period of six to twelve months, the cause is often
emotional distress.  In one to three percent of cases, there is a physical cause, usually bladder infection.<br>
<a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> offers useful assistance and is particularly worth trying in children.</p><br>
<center><img src="images/line30.gif"></center>
<br>
<center>
<a name="incontinence"><h3>Urinary Incontinence</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is an involuntary release of urine.  It is common in older people, particularly men with enlarged prostate glands
and women who have had many children.  In some cases <a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> can alleviate this
problem.</p><br>
<center><img src="images/line30.gif"></center>
<br>
<center>
<a name="retention"><h3>Urinary Retention</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This occurs most often in elderly men and is most commonly due to enlargement of the prostate gland
situated at the base of the bladder.  If it is recurrent, it is important that the opinion of a urological surgeon is
sought.  The approach with <a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> can be very useful if the retention is caught
early. </p><br>

<a name="jet"><h3>Jet Lag</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Jet Lag, formally known as "circadian desynchronosis", is a disruption of the subtle but powerful internal 
biological clock that regulates many body functions, such as temperature, kidney output, and normal sleep/wake
patterns.  It affects not only travelers but also people who word at odd hours.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="hangover"><h3>Hangover</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Hangover is a mild version of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which causes delerium tremens (DT) in alcoholics.
The headache of hangover is caused, in part, by alcohol's relaxing effect on the blood vessels.  As they relax, they
open up and accommodate more blood, which causes the sensation of warmth people associate with drinking.  But
if the blood vessels of the head open too much, they trigger nerve activity causing pain.  Alcohol also increases 
urination and can lead to moderate dehydration.  The nausea and vomiting are a combination of alcohol's 
irritating effect on the stomac and its effect on the central nervous system.  Alcohol has a depressant effect and 
causes build-up of acids in the blood which produces fatigue and a general lousy-all-over feeling.  </p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="stress"><h3>Anxiety and Stressful States</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Anxiety is out biological alarm.  When we perceive danger, we respond by becoming anxious.  A certain amount
of anxiety is normal but sometimes normal levels are exceeded and safe situations are perceived as dangerous.  
Scientist believe that levels of anxiety are influenced by complex interaction of genetics, illnesses, drugs, and our
history of traumatic events.</p>

<a name="distention"><h3>Abdominal Distention</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Recurring abdominal distension is a common problem, particularly in women.  It is most commonly due to
dysfunction of the colon.  Some cases can be helped enormously by <a href="abouthp.html">HealthPoint</a>
but often a dietary approach should also be considered.  Most effective is to avoid foods such as sugar and
yeast as distension is often due to candida (a yeast like organism) in the gut.  Candida growth is stimulated by
yeast and sugar.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="colitis"><h3>Colitis</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Colitis is inflammation of the colon.  The symptom is often loose bowels, with mucous and sometimes blood
passed.  <a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> has proven to be beneficial.  Attention to diet is also beneficial
since colitis can in most cases be due to food sensitivity.  The most common foods involved are milk and dairy
products.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="constipation"><h3>Constipation</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Most constipation is caused by a combination of too little exercise and too little fiber and fluid in the diet.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="diarrohoea"><h3>Diarrhea</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Diarrhea, if it is chronic, is commonly due to colitis.  If acute it may be infective.  Acute infective diarrhea is
most often due to a virus but in some cases can be due to a more serious infection such as salmonella.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="haemorrhoids"><h3>Haemorrhoids</h3></a>

<p>Haemorrhoids are caricosities of the veins around the lower end of the rectum.  </p>

<a name="strain"><h3>Repetitive Strain Injuries</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Increasing intensity of industrial, computer, typewriter, and sports activities has led to wider recognition of
over-use injuries (generally known as repetitive strain injuries).  Over-use relates to repetitive, usually stereopyped,
performance of limited movement patterns.  These are genrally highly specific for the activity coverced e.g. typing,
tennis, kicking, using a screwdriver.  The first principle of treatment is to rest and to avoid the repetitive action which
causes the pain.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="intercostal"><h3>Intercostal Neuralgia</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is due to irritation of the Intercostal nerves.  These originate form the spine at the back and pass around
either side of the chest just below each rib.  They can cause pain and breathing difficulty.<br>
Accurate diagnosis is very important because this symptom occurring on the left side of the body could signify
angina (heart pain).  It could also indicate pleurisy on either side.  </p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="back"><h3>Back Pain - Disk - Spondylosis</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is most commonly due to narrowed discs in the lower lumbar spine.  Occasionally the cause can be a
prolapsed inter vertebral disc and in these cases the pain often extends into the leg.  </p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="hip"><h3>Hip Pain</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is most commonly due to arthritis in the hip.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="knee"><h3>Knee Pain</h3></a>
</center>
<p>In older people this is often due to arthritis of the knee, and in younger people, damage to the Cartilages in the
knee joint is generally the culprit.  Occasionally these Cartilages are rotn due to a twisting injury.  The knee can
sometimes lock when the torn cartilage sticks in the joint making removal of the cartilage (or a part of it) the most
likely remedy.  Generally the use of <a href="abouthp.html">HeathPoint</a> is highly effective in treating knee
pains.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="ankle"><h3>Ankle Pain</h3></a>
</center>
<p>When acute, pain is often due to a sprain.  A chronic pain may indicate arthritis.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="foot"><h3>Foot Pain</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This can be due to strain, but could also be arthritis (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis).</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="sciatica"><h3>Sciatica</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is pain radiated down the sciatic nerve which runs down the back of the leg onto the outer aspect of the foot.
Sciatica does not always mean that there is a prolapsed intervertebral disc  (a so-called "disc") present.</p>

by emotional stress, a full stomach, and exposure to cold.</p>

<a name="facial"><h3>Facial Paralysis - Bell's Palsy</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This condition causes the eyelid and the side to the mouth to droop on the affected side. These muscles
become weakened as no nerve impulses are reaching them.  It can, in some cases be due to a virus.  Bell's palsy
is usually temporary and develops suddenly, often overnight.  Sometimes it involves ear or facial pain and, in
severe cases, speech becomes impaired, and the senses of hearing and taste suffer.  <br>
Bell's palsy causes facial droop without numbness and/or weakness on that side of the body.  If weakness and/or
numbness is experienced, the cause could be a stroke. <br><br>
<a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint </a>can be very useful in treating the condition and should be used two or
three times a day until the paralysis has completely gone.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="laryngitis"><h3>Laryngitis - 'Sore Throat'</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Laryngitis is nearly always an acute problem that involves loss of voice and is often due to a viral infection.
Latyngitis occur when the vocal cords become inflamed and swollen and cannot move freely.  Frequently no other
discomfort than hoarseness of loss of voice is experienced.  People who use their voice a great deal often suffer
chronic laryngitis due to overuse or misuse of the voice.  Those who <!--<a href="smoking.html" base target="INFOWIN">-->smoke</a> cigarettes,
abuse alcohol, or work around paints, solvents, and other chemicals may also suffer chronic laryngitis. <br>
Chronic laryngitis should always be investigated  by a qualified E.N.T. specialist to rule out a more serious
problem.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="sinusitis"><h3>Sinusitis</h3></a>
</center>
<p> Sinusitis causes nasal congestion, fullness and pressure throughout the sinus area, headache, runny nose,
pain on one side or both sides of the face, and possibly, <a href="chest.html" base target="INFOWIN">cough</a>, and
<a href="#laryngitis">laryngitis</a>.  Sinusitis is very common and can occur either in the maxillary sinuses, which
lie on both sides, deep in the face below the eyes, or the frontal sinuses, situated on either side of the bridge of
the nose.  The sinuses give the voice resonance and decrease the weight of the skull.  They are lined with glands
that produce moist mucus - above a quart a day - which moistens, warms, and humidifies the air we inhale and
helps prevent colds.  Sinusitis occurs when the sinuses' drainage openings swell or become obstructed
disrupting normal sinus drainage. As a consequence, fluid accumulates and microorgainsms to infect it.
Sinusitis could be caused by <a href="misc3.html" base target="INFOWIN">allergies</a>, <a href="chest.html" base target="INFOWIN">asthma</a>, colds,
<a href="chest.html" base target="INFOWIN">chronic bronchitis</a>, flu, building syndrome, an irritant, or a structural abnormality in the
nose or bones of the face.   <br><br>
People with sinusitis should consider other treatments to complement <a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a>.
Additional approaches to be considered include diet, the avoidance of mucous producing foods such as milk,
dairy products and red meat. Attention should be paid to bowel function.  Even slight constipation, in those
predisposed to sinusitis, can lead to troublesome chronic problems.  The reason for this is that the colon is
connected to the sinuses as the large intestine meridian ends on the sinuses and has a connection whith the large
intestine itself.</p>

<a name="heartburn"><h3>Hearburn</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Heartburn is due to regurgitation of stomach acids up the oesophagus.  It is sometimes an accompaniment
of hiatus hernia where the top part of the stomach (the so-called fundus) herniates up into the chest.  This is
often associated with patients who are overweight and therefore weight loss can be very helpful.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="liver"><h3>Liver Trouble</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Liver trouble is often accompanied by general biliousness and intolerance to fatty foods.  Intake of dietary
fats should be reduced as it is the lever that has to cope, in the main, with these fats.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="nausea"><h3>Nausea</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Nausea can occur for many reasons, but <a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> offers a useful aid.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="upper"><h3>Upper Abdominal Pain</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Upper abdominal pain is a very common problem and diagnosis is essential.  The problem sometimes arises
in the stomach, (for example, due to a peptic ulcer), or in some cases the gallbladder.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="gallbladderD"><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3></a>
</center>
<p>Inflammation of the gallbladder is relatively common.  Corret diagnosis is essential as many other conditions
mimic gallbladder disease.  Dietary approach is important, and avoidance of fatty foods is essential.  </p>
<center>
<img src="images/line30.gif">
<a name="gallbladderC"><h3>Gallbladder Colic - Biliary Colic</h3></a>
</center>
<p>This is pain caused by a stone in the bile duct that passes from the gallbladder into the duodenum.  This is
colicky pain, which coomes in spasms.  While medical advice should be sought, treatment with
<a href="abouthp.html" base target="INFOWIN">HealthPoint</a> is often successful.</p>
