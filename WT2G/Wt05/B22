<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.

<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR

<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers

facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>

<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060.

<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health.

<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we

<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield.

<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:

<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White

of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);

<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access

subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.

<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.
 
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page

<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.

<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement

<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment

disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>

In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The

Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary

safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:

of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.

<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates

or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;

<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><B>IAEA Guidebook, 1983
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved

line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>

in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we

<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.

<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the

<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process.

forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.

<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several
initiatives in advance of 1994: ...</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White

of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a

Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing

</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:

<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.

<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow

<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;

<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.

<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.

<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14

disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);

<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the

properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and

<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing

<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a
contingent programme for development of a DWR and the views of various parties
on the RCF approach (Sections 7 and 8); and
</LI>
<LI>how information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the
regulatory authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development
of a DWR at Sellafield, and the place of the RCF within the planning schedule
and cost projections for development of a DWR there (Section 9).
</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a

</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).
</P>
<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.

(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;

</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.

<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14

disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield

<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access

subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)

<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;

stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on

by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.

guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:

<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

<P>3.1   My evidence covers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Nirex's history, organisation and presence in Cumbria (Section 4);
</LI>
<LI>development of Government policy on ILW disposal since 1982 (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>the Company's site selection procedures followed from 1987 (Section 6);
</LI>
<LI>the place of the RCF as part of a site confirmation stage within a

</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.

<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it.

<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration

stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:

<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in

public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).
</P>
<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)

<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall.

[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.

<P><B>MICHAEL THOMAS FOLGER will say:
</B></P>
<P> <B><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B></P>
<P>1.1   I have been a Director of United Kingdom Nirex Limited (&quot;Nirex&quot;
or the &quot;Company&quot;) since June 1991 and Managing Director since
September of that year. Within strategy and policies decided by the Board of
Directors, I lead the executive team in delivering Nirex's step-by-step
programme. That programme is directed at disposal of intermediate-level and
low-level radioactive wastes (&quot;ILW&quot; and &quot;LLW&quot;, as classified
in the White Paper Cm. 2919 <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
Final Conclusions, (&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)</I> [GOV/208.]) 
</P>
<P>1.2   Since November 1991 I have been a member of the Radioactive Waste
Management Advisory Committee (the &quot;RWMAC&quot;).
</P>
<P>1.3   I was an administrative grade civil servant in HM Treasury between
1971 and 1985. During that time I was granted study leave in the United States
(1978-79) as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth Fund of New York and was
seconded for two years to the Wiggins Teape Group (1981-83). In 1985 I joined
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in its London office and was employed in a range of
investment banking work - latterly as a Senior Vice-President - until 1991. 
</P>
<P>1.4   I hold the degree of Master of Arts from Cambridge University, where I
studied Natural Sciences and then Economics. I also hold the degree of Master of
Science in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, following
study there at the Sloan School of Management.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Summary"></A>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P><B>Scope of Evidence
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para2.1"></A>2.1   This proof describes Nirex's history,
organisation and presence in Cumbria; the development of Government policy on
ILW disposal since 1982 and the Company's site selection procedures followed
from 1987. It explains the place of the Rock Characterisation Facility (&quot;RCF&quot;)
within a site confirmation stage which forms part of a programme for providing a
deep waste repository (&quot;DWR&quot;). The evidence also reports the views of
independent bodies on the RCF approach. In conclusion, the Company's contingent
schedule and associated cost projections for the DWR programme are described,
together with the way in which the phased RCF programme fits within that
schedule and those projections.
</P>
<P><B>Nirex
</B></P>
<P>2.2   Nirex, as a company owned by the principal civil producers of
radioactive waste, is responsible for providing a DWR, within the terms of
Government policy, for ILW and for LLW requiring deep disposal. The Company has
an established presence in West Cumbria and maintains liaison arrangements with
Cumbria County Council, other local authorities and local communities in the
area. There is evidence of public support in Cumbria for the Company's proposal
to develop an RCF. 
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy on ILW Disposal
</B></P>
<P>2.3   The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in a Parliamentary
announcement in 1989, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository should
be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next steps
should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of
boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations would
enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction of a
repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when such
investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals.
</P>
<P>2.4   The Government's 1994-95 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.5   In short, the RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context
and is consistent with it.
</P>
<P><B>Site Selection Procedures
</B></P>
<P>2.6   Nirex's site selection procedures have followed recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (&quot;IAEA&quot;) set down in 1983. They
took account of responses to public consultation undertaken during 1987 and
1988. The RWMAC reviewed the procedures leading to a 1989 shortlist of 12
candidate sites for the DWR and believed the approach to be defensible. It
accepted the logic in identifying the Dounreay and Sellafield areas for
investigation. Following a recent consideration of whether Nirex may be
considered to have adopted a reasonable approach in its investigations so far,
the Government has not proposed any change of procedure. 
</P>
<P>2.7   In 1991, the Company reviewed preliminary results available from the
geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield. The
risks of concentrating on a single preferred site, as previously planned, were
judged acceptable. It was decided to concentrate investigations on Sellafield in
the light of the initial results from the physical investigations, major
transport advantages of Sellafield viewed as a candidate repository location,
and the fact that expert assessments of other attributes of the two locations
showed little change.  
</P>
<P><B>The RCF and Site Confirmation
</B></P>
<P>2.8   In May 1992 the Company viewed results from a preliminary safety
assessment of Sellafield as encouraging and suggesting a &quot;so far so good&quot;
picture of the site's potential suitability as a location for a DWR. However, a
decision on whether to submit a planning application for development of a
repository was postponed because the available data were insufficient to permit
a firm view to be reached on a model of the hydrogeological system. The Company
decided in September 1992 to break out the RCF as a necessary free-standing
stage in its further site investigations, to permit firmer interpretations of
the hydrogeological system needed to inform a decision whether to propose
development of a DWR at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><B>Review of the Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>2.9   A Royal Society Study Group and the RWMAC have indicated their support
for the RCF proposal. Cumbria County Council has stated that the decision to
break out the RCF is a logical stage in demonstrating the safety case for a
repository. It has described the RCF as a research facility. The overall Nirex
approach to site characterisation and site confirmation is consistent with the
terms of an IAEA Safety Guide published in 1994.
</P>
<P><B>The RCF within the Forward Programme
</B></P>
<P>2.10   The RCF programme sits within a contingent schedule for a deep
repository and will progressively provide confirmatory information which should
help the regulatory authorities to form a view on whether there appears to be
any impediment to eventual authorisation for waste disposal of a repository at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>2.11   The time taken to bring a DWR into operation is an important
influence on total costs. Consistently with Government policy, and to give focus
to the management of a complex project, the Company sets a contingent target
date for bringing a repository into operation, which is kept under review. The
Company would not propose development of a repository unless and until it were
confident the regulatory authorities would foresee no impediment to the eventual
authorisation and licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P>2.12   The planned outlays from 1 April 1995 on constructing an RCF and
carrying out scientific studies directly associated with it are &#163;195
million at 1995 prices. From the same date, the total projected cost of bringing
a DWR into operation at Sellafield is &#163;1493 million at 1995 prices. In the
context of the overall target costs for a DWR at Sellafield, the RCF is not a
significant pre-commitment to eventual repository development in economic terms.

</LI></UL>
<P><B><A NAME="Nirex"></A>4. NIREX</B></P>
<P><B>Role of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.1 Nirex is working to provide and manage facilities for the safe disposal
of ILW and LLW. Such wastes have arisen in the UK for over 40 years and come
from the nuclear power industry, medical, research and defence establishments
and other industries. For ILW, UK Government policy requires deep disposal in an
underground repository. Certain LLW will also require deep disposal as it is
unsuitable for disposal at the Drigg surface facility operated by BNFL.
</P>
<P>4.2 Nirex has no responsibility for high level waste disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 ILW estimated to exist as at 1 January 1995, when
conditioned for disposal on current packaging assumptions, will have a volume of
97,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>. On the same basis, a further 75,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of ILW
is projected to arise by 2010, as can be derived from COR/520. In the light of
bids for space made by major customers in 1993, the Company announced in its
press release of 8 April 1994, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that it was planning for
a total of 400,000 m<SUP>3
</SUP>of radioactive waste, including 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of LLW, to be
disposed of in an underground repository up to 2060. 
</P>
<P><B>Origins of Nirex
</B></P>
<P>4.4 In 1976 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, chaired by Sir
Brian Flowers (now Lord Flowers), issued its Sixth Report <I>Nuclear Power and
the Environment</I> [GOV/201]. Recommendation 41 of the report was that a
Nuclear Waste Disposal Corporation should be established, as an independent
statutory body responsible for the safe disposal of all waste arisings at
nuclear sites. The Government's initial response to that recommendation was
given in the May 1977 White Paper, <I>Nuclear Power and the Environment The
Government's Response to the Sixth Report of the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution
</I>[GOV/216], which stated in paragraph 20:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Commission recommended (41) that a Nuclear Waste Disposal
Corporation should be set up. They saw a need, not currently fulfilled, for an
executive body to develop and manage radioactive waste disposal facilities, and
they had in mind the desirability of continuity in managing the disposal and
containment of long-lived wastes. The Government see the force of this proposal,
but do not think they need to come to a decision at this stage. They propose to
reconsider it in due course in the light of the results of the current review of
existing policy for waste disposal; and they will also seek the advice of the
Nuclear Waste Management Advisory Committee.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.5 In July 1982, the Government announced in paragraph 57 of the White
Paper <I>Radioactive Waste Management</I>, (<I>&quot;the 1982 White Paper&quot;</I>)
[GOV/203] that, with its agreement, a Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste
Executive (the &quot;Executive&quot;) was to be set up by the component parts of
the nuclear industry, in co-operation, &quot;<I>to provide a mechanism by which
they can successfully fulfil their own responsibilities in this field and work
within a comprehensive plan for waste management</I>.&quot; 
</P>
<P>4.6 The Executive was responsible for arranging deep sea disposals, from
1983, of certain ILW and LLW. Because of national policy changes, no such
disposals were put into effect and the Executive concentrated its work on
providing facilities for geological disposal of ILW and LLW.
</P>
<P>4.7 United Kingdom Nirex Limited was incorporated in November 1985, as the
successor to the Executive, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement (&quot;<I>the
Shareholders' Agreement</I>&quot;) which recited the Shareholders' need to
dispose of ILW and LLW. British Nuclear Fuels plc (&quot;BNFL&quot;) and Nuclear
Electric plc each owns 42% of the issued ordinary share capital, and Scottish
Nuclear Limited and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (the &quot;UKAEA&quot;)
each owns 7%. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry holds a Special
Share.
</P>
<P>4.8 The objects for which the Company was established, as set out in its
Memorandum of Association, include:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To carry on business in the collection, treatment, transport,
storage and disposal of radioactive and other related materials.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.9 The financing needed for the Company's operations is provided by
prospective major customers or by Shareholders. The Ministry of Defence (the &quot;MOD&quot;)
has agreed, in principle and effective from 1 April 1994, to make pre-payments
in respect of its intended use of the repository. The remainder of the financing
is provided by Shareholder loans.
</P>
<P><B>Company Structure
</B></P>
<P>4.10 The Nirex Board of Directors comprises one nominee from Scottish
Nuclear Limited and two each from the UKAEA, BNFL and Nuclear Electric plc. As
Special Shareholder, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry nominates two
directors. In addition, the Managing Director and the Finance and Corporate
Services Director of Nirex are members of the Board. Sir Richard Morris CBE FEng
has been Chairman since September 1989.
</P>
<P>4.11 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] restated in paragraphs
43-45 certain conclusions on the future structure of Nirex set out in the May
1995 White Paper <I>The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK</I> (&quot;<I>the
Nuclear Review White Paper</I>&quot;)[GOV/215]. Specifically, it stated that the
Government would retain its special share in Nirex, that the new privatised
nuclear generating companies would be shareholders in Nirex, and that <I>the
Shareholders' Agreement </I>should in future contain a specific undertaking that
the Company will abide by Government policy. In paragraph 44 it said that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>With these safeguards, the Government considers it unnecessary to
seek additional legal powers to enforce its policies in relation to the timely
disposal of waste.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Organisation and Staffing</B></P>
<P>4.12 As at 31 May 1995, the Company's staff numbered 215, with 15 vacancies.
Of the 215 staff in post, 173 were employees based at Harwell, Oxfordshire.
Twenty-three full-time staff seconded by Shareholders or supplied on contract by
other firms were also based at Harwell. Nineteen Company employees were based at
Greengarth Hall, Holmrook, Cumbria. 
</P>
<P>4.13 The Company's organisational structure is shown in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. Staff in the core departments - Science,
Technical and Project - direct and oversee specialist contractors and
consultants engaged respectively in the Science Programme; preparation of
specifications for the disposal system (including transport and packaging
aspects) and environmental assessment; and the design and management of capital
projects (currently the RCF and in due course a DWR). 
</P>
<P>4.14 The Science Department is responsible for the Science Programme, which
will be described by Dr Holmes, Director for Science. Its current main task is
to assess the post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>4.15 The Science Department maintains close liaison with the Technical
Department which is responsible for preparing a disposal system specification to
meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and satisfy customer needs
in an environmentally acceptable way. 
</P>
<P><B>Nirex in Cumbria
</B></P>
<P>4.16 The Nirex presence in Cumbria centres on the Director (Cumbria) and his
staff at Greengarth Hall, with appropriate Corporate Communications, Science and
Project Department staff also based there. 
</P>
<P>4.17 Science Programme contractors' staff based in Cumbria numbered
approximately 200 at the peak of drilling operations in early 1994, these
individuals being based at Longlands Farm and other operating sites. As at 3
March 1995, the total had reduced to 108, mostly located at Greengarth Hall. The
reduction reflected a decrease in borehole activity, with some drilling
suspended to avoid disturbance to a pump test being carried out in boreholes at
Longlands Farm.
</P>
<P>4.18 As at 3 March 1995, 19 Nirex employees were permanent residents in West
Cumbria. The comparable figure for contractors was 72. 
</P>
<P>4.19 Nirex wishes to see locally resident people take the fullest advantage
of employment opportunities arising from the RCF project. As far as reasonable
and practicable, RCF contractors will be required to maximise employment and
training of local personnel and, in collaboration with Nirex, provide the
necessary framework to make this policy work. Professor MacKay concludes in
paragraph <A HREF="../nrx10/nrx10.htm#Para8.1">8.1</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/10)</B>
that the employment created by the development will be of benefit to West
Cumbria.
</P>
<P>4.20 The Company maintains a sponsorship programme to promote local
educational activities and to help community-based projects. In 1994-95, this
included university sponsorships for three students in earth sciences
disciplines.
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with Local Authorities and Local Communities </U></P>
<P>4.21 Since 1990 senior Nirex staff have accepted invitations to make
periodic reports to the Sellafield Local Liaison Committee, which is chaired by
a senior County Councillor, Mr W Minto OBE, and to its Environmental Health
Sub-Committee, chaired by Professor K Boddy OBE. The Committee was established
in 1957 and its objectives include serving as a channel of information and
comment on aspects of current and future operations at the Sellafield and Drigg
sites of BNFL/UKAEA which may affect the local community or environment. 
</P>
<P>4.22 The Director (Cumbria) represents the Company on the Nirex Liaison
Group. This formal liaison machinery was set up in 1991 and is chaired at senior
officer level by Cumbria County Council. Copeland Borough Council is also
represented and the Lake District Special Planning Board attends at officer
level. Proceedings of the Liaison Group are documented in <I>Minutes of Nirex
Liaison Group, 1991-1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the Liaison Group Minutes</I>&quot;)
[CCC/1/2].
</P>
<P>4.23 At local level, to complement periodic briefings of district and parish
councils, the Company has set up with Gosforth Parish Council both a
Gosforth/Nirex Local Liaison Group and a Gosforth/Nirex Technical Consultative
Group. Representatives of adjoining parish councils attend regular meetings of
the local liaison group and the technical consultative group is to meet publicly
in future. 
</P>
<P>4.24 In addition to those channels of communication, on 16 December 1994 the
Company formally proposed to Cumbria County Council the formation of a joint
Consultation Committee, chaired at member level by the County Council and with
representation from other local authorities, to review and discuss progress of
the RCF programme as it proceeds, including the scientific results as they come
forward. The Company wrote to the County on 8 June 1995 confirming that the
proposal still stands and seeking to carry it forward as an agreed matter in the
context of the Inquiry. The County Council replied on 10 July 1995 stating that
the Company's proposal would be referred to the appropriate Committee of the
County Council when it next met. Copeland Borough Council notified the Company
in a letter of 19 July 1995 that its Policy &amp; Resources Committee would
consider the same matter when it next met. The correspondence is reproduced in
NRX/12/2.</P>
<P><U>Local Opinion</U></P>
<P>4.25 Through a public information programme, Nirex seeks to develop and
sustain a measure of support for its activities within the communities in which
it operates. Opinion surveys can be a useful way of gauging support.
</P>
<P>4.26 Several surveys have been carried out on behalf of Cumbria County
Council, as reported on pages 65-84 of the <I>Report by the Director of Economy
and Environment, Cumbria County Council, December 1994</I> [COR/104], and as
detailed in part in <I>The ICM Research Nirex Opinion Poll Wave 3, Prepared for
Cumbria County Council, November 1994</I>, (&quot;<I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>&quot;)
[COR/411]. Results from an opinion survey conducted for Copeland Borough Council
are set out in <I>Socio-Economic Impact Study of the Nuclear Industry Among
Residents on behalf of Copeland Borough Council, May 1995, North East Market
Surveys</I>, [COR/407]. 
</P>
<P>4.27 On the proposal to build an RCF at Sellafield, <I>the 1994 ICM Poll</I>
[COR/411] invited respondents to state which of four specific views was closest
to their own. Table 16 on page 32 of COR/411 shows that 43% of Cumbrian
respondents and 62% of Copeland respondents stated that the view closest to
their own was that it was a &quot;<I>Good idea to test the rock structure and
how the water flows</I>&quot;. The same table also showed the next most popular
view: 37% of Cumbrian respondents and 20% of Copeland respondents stated that
the view closest to their own was that &quot;<I>Once they have gone that far
there will be no stopping the repository</I>&quot;. There is no information on
whether some respondents may have held more than one of the views specified,
albeit one being more strongly held than others. 
</P>
<P>4.28 The report on the May 1995 survey of Copeland Residents conducted for
Copeland Borough Council [COR/407] shows, in Question 13a, 53.8% of respondents
as &quot;<I>not concerned</I>&quot;<I> </I>about &quot;<I>the proposal by
Nirex</I>&quot;,<I> </I>in the words of the relevant question, to locate &quot;<I>a
RCF and repository in the area</I>&quot;.<I> </I>(21.0% were &quot;<I>concerned</I>&quot;
and 14.6% &quot;<I>very concerned</I>&quot;.)
</P>
<P>4.29 Recognising the difficulties in comparing results from different
surveys, because of different methodologies, questions and sampling techniques,
the various opinion surveys indicate support for the RCF amongst the general
public in Cumbria. The level of support appears to be higher in Copeland than in
the rest of Cumbria.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="GovernmentPolicy"></A>5. GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ILW DISPOSAL</B></P>
<P>5.1 This section of my evidence briefly traces Government policy on disposal
of ILW between 1982 and 1995. The policy has been broadly unchanged since 1986.
</P>
<P><B>Government Policy from 1982
</B></P>
<P>5.2 In <I>the 1982 White Paper</I> [GOV/203] the Government stated in
paragraph 36:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The lack of suitable disposal facilities for intermediate-level
wastes is the major current gap in waste management, and it is important that it
should be remedied. The types of wastes that can be accepted at any given
facility will depend upon the details of the eventual design, and the packaging
of the wastes, and it is not therefore possible to say with certainty at this
stage how many facilities will be required. Work is now proceeding on the basis
of bringing into operation by the end of the decade facilities which should be
able to accept a high proportion of the wastes suitable for disposal. The
probable forms are an engineered trench at a depth of about 20 - 30 metres, and
a modified mine or purpose-built cavity at greater depth.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 In October 1983, the Executive announced that it
would investigate a site at Elstow in Bedfordshire for shallow disposal and a
disused anhydrite mine at Billingham in Cleveland for deep disposal.
Considerable local concern was expressed in the areas of Elstow and Billingham
about the investigations. On 24 January 1985, the Secretary of State for the
Environment in a statement to the House of Commons, <I>(Hansard) </I>[GOV/217],
invited the Executive not to proceed further at Billingham and asked it to
select at least two further sites, in addition to Elstow, for investigation for
shallow disposal. 
</P>
<P>5.4 The Executive was also requested, in the choice of sites, to take full
account of research into methods of containing the radioactivity in the wastes.
In February 1986, Nirex announced that investigations for shallow disposal would
be undertaken at three additional locations. Public controversy arose at these
new locations and continued at Elstow.
</P>
<P><B>The 1986 Rossi Report and the Government Response
</B></P>
<P>5.5 In March 1986 the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment,
under the chairmanship of Sir Hugh Rossi, published its <I>First Report from
the Environment Committee Session 1985-86 Radioactive Waste</I> (&quot;<I>The
Rossi Report</I>&quot;) [GOV/304]. The report concluded that the UK lagged
behind other nations in work on geological disposal of radioactive waste. On
underground research, it stated in paragraph 115:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... While it is essential that site specific research is carried
out, it is a </I>sine qua non <I>that a site for research should be accepted by
the local population. All the countries we have visited have or are constructing
underground facilities which are being used for research alone and which are not
intended to be developed as full operational disposal sites. This seems a
sensible approach. It will provide much needed research in this country and will
convince the public. We are anxious that what has happened over Billingham
should not be repeated with a new deep geological site. <B>We therefore
recommend:
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(i) research on a fully constructed deep geological site in this
country is urgently needed and should be implemented; 
</B></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><B>(ii) such a site should be designated as an experimental facility,
explicitly excluded from being a potential operational facility</B>.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 <I>The Rossi Report</I> also recommended that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>... Near surface disposal facilities are only acceptable for
short-lived low-level wastes ...</B></I>&quot;(para. 99).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.7 In July 1986 the Government published its response to <I>the Rossi
Report </I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 White Paper</I>&quot;) [GOV/202]. It stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... continues to favour early disposal because in
general this carries a lower risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public.</I>&quot;(para. 10);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is committed to the development of a deep facility.
Studies here and abroad have confirmed that it is feasible. Further research on
the different systems that are available is being undertaken. The next step will
be for NIREX to identify potential sites for detailed investigation, so that a
site can be chosen to put to a public inquiry and, if approved, developed. In
the course of its development there will be a period of comprehensive testing
and experimentation before the facility becomes operational. There will be no
need for the prior construction of a separate experimental facility. This would
only raise concern in the area affected without yielding any compensatory
benefit. Nor, within the relatively restricted area of the UK, is it likely that
such a number of suitable sites will be identified as to make it sensible to
abandon a site that is good enough for ultimate disposal.</I>&quot; (para. 55.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Government thus made clear its policy view that an experimental
underground facility at a location explicitly excluded from consideration as a
potential repository site, as recommended in <I>the Rossi Report</I>, was not
appropriate in the UK context. 
</P>
<P>5.8 <I>The 1986 White Paper</I> [GOV/202] also stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... there are no technical reasons why LLW and short-lived ILW
should not be placed in a near-surface facility with the element of containment
envisaged ...</I>&quot;(para. 49);</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government ... recognises that many people would be reassured
if ... </I>[such a] <I>site</I> <I>were used only for LLW. In these
circumstances ... the Government has decided that NIREX should proceed on the
basis that a near-surface facility will only be authorised for the disposal of
what is broadly described as low-level waste ...</I>&quot; (para. 50).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The 1987 Decision for a Multi-Purpose DWR
</B></P>
<P>5.9 In April 1987, Nirex took stock of its investigations at the four sites
for a shallow repository. Because of the Government decision announced in its
1986 White Paper, these had become candidates for disposal of LLW only. On 30
April 1987 the Chairman of Nirex wrote to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, in a letter reproduced in Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Eighth Annual
Report, September 1987 </I>[GOV/411], and recommended that work on the four
sites be taken no further. The Company had concluded that, in marginal terms,
there was not a lot of difference between the cost of disposing of LLW with ILW
in a deep repository and the cost of disposing of it in a new shallow
repository. 
</P>
<P>5.10 The Chairman's letter [GOV/411] said, in part, that in concentrating
future work on deep disposal:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... it would be wise to avoid premature commitments to a preferred
technique or how or when sites for investigation are to be identified. One
lesson from our work so far is surely that the public does not like feeling
pressurised to accept imposed solutions in this area and I would think time
spent now in considering all the issues in this way would be time well spent.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.11 The Secretary of State, in a letter of 1 May 1987, also reproduced in
Appendix C of GOV/411, agreed with the Nirex conclusion that disposal of LLW in
a multi-purpose repository would be preferable to shallow disposal. In a
statement to the House of Commons on the same day he explained that Nirex would
concentrate on identifying a <I>&quot;suitable location for a deep
multi-purpose facility&quot;
</I>for both ILW and LLW (<I>Hansard</I>)<I> </I>(&quot;<I>the 1987
Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;) [GOV/210].
</P>
<P>5.12 The May 1987 decision marked the beginning of the current DWR
programme, under which Nirex site investigations are now concentrated at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>The 1989 Parliamentary Statement 
</B></P>
<P>5.13 On 21 March 1989 the Secretary of State for the Environment announced
in a Written Answer in reply to a Parliamentary Question (<I>Hansard) (</I>&quot;<I>the
1989 Parliamentary Statement</I>&quot;<I>)
</I>[GOV/211]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex's report and recommendations on the disposal of low and
intermediate-level radioactive waste in a deep repository were submitted to
Government on 28 February. Nirex recommends that a repository should be
constructed in the form of a mine under the land, and that the next steps should
be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking of boreholes,
in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. In arriving at these recommendations
Nirex has concluded that it would be best to explore first those sites where
there is some measure of local support for civil nuclear activities. The further
evaluation of the geology of these two areas will enable Nirex to decide on
their suitability for construction of a repository, or whether it will be
necessary to evaluate other sites.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Government, having consulted the radioactive waste management
advisory committee accept the report and note that Nirex, having examined the
arguments for storage rather than disposal of radioactive waste, has endorsed
the Government's policy of disposal. The Government agree that further
exploratory work is necessary before any particular site can be decided upon,
and that it is for Nirex to obtain the necessary planning permissions through
the normal procedures. Only when these investigations have been undertaken will
Nirex be in a position to submit proposals for a substantive development and to
seek the necessary approvals.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.14 The advice to Government from the RWMAC took the form of a letter of 16
March 1989 from its Chairman to the Secretary of State. As published at Appendix
C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report </I>November 1989<I>,</I> [GOV/402], it
stated in part:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>RWMAC has reviewed the site selection procedures adopted by United
Kingdom Nirex Ltd which have led to the identification of the short-list of
twelve sites. The Committee believes that the approach adopted by Nirex is
defensible. We also accept the logic in identifying the two areas for further
evaluation which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield.
The Nirex decision is consistent with our advice given to yourself in the
published RWMAC response to Nirex's consultative document 'The Way Forward'.
Nevertheless, the Committee recognises that sites associated with better
geological conditions, and which are more robust in radiological terms, exist.
However, it would be inappropriate for such sites to be evaluated by detailed
site investigation until the suitability of Dounreay and Sellafield had been
established.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.15 In March 1989, the Company published <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]. That
reported on work undertaken following public consultation initiated in 1987 -
which I explain in Section 6 of this Proof of Evidence - and explained the
Company's decision as a first step to limit further investigations to candidate
DWR sites at Dounreay and Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.16 In September 1990 the Government referred in <I>This Common
Inheritance </I>[GOV/204] at paragraph 15.29 to its deep disposal policy and
Nirex's investigations at Dounreay and Sellafield:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>As part of its strategy for the disposal of intermediate-level
waste, the Government gave UK Nirex Ltd the task of developing a deep
underground repository to isolate the waste from the environment for the many
thousands of years which will be necessary. In 1987 the Government agreed that
the repository should also be used for low-level waste. Nirex is now carrying
out detailed geological studies at Dounreay and Sellafield to identify a
suitable site. These investigations are subject to normal planning procedures,
and the Government will make any proposal for development subject to a full
public inquiry as well as to compliance with strict safety standards.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the heading &quot;<I>GOVERNMENT ACTION AND POLICY REVIEW</I>&quot;,
<I>This Common Inheritance </I>also stated, in paragraph 15.38:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government will carry out a full-scale review of the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994 when the Sizewell B project will be nearing
completion. The Government and the nuclear industry will take several

<P>5.17 The 1992 Government publication <I>Environment in Trust Radioactive
Waste Management - A Safe Solution</I> [GOV/305], in a section headed &quot;<I>DISPOSAL
OPTIONS FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTE</I>&quot;, stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government is satisfied that safe disposal routes can be
developed in the UK for low- and intermediate-level wastes, and that early
disposal in a deep facility is the right answer. This policy has been endorsed
by both the House of Commons Select Committee on the Environment and the House
of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities. The Government also
believes that on-site storage is an unacceptable long-term option because in
general it carries a higher risk to workers in the nuclear industry and to the
public and because decisions on disposal should not be left to future
generations. A number of studies and both Select Committees support this view.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy
</B></P>
<P>5.18 On 19 May 1994, the Secretary of State for the Environment announced a
review of radioactive waste management policy (<I>Hansard)
</I>[GOV/214], to be separate from but complementary to a review of the future
prospects for nuclear power in the UK, announced by the Minister for Energy. He
explained that the Department of the Environment proposed to publish its
preliminary conclusions on the review of radioactive waste management policy
later that summer, as a basis for consultation. Separately, Her Majestys
Inspectorate of Pollution (&quot;HMIP&quot;) would be issuing for consultation a
revision of the 1984 publication <I>Disposal Facilities on Land for Low and
Intermediate-Level Radioactive Wastes: Principles for the Protection of the
Human Environment</I>, (&quot;<I>the Green Book</I>&quot;) [GOV/302]. In
parallel, the RWMAC, together with the Advisory Committee on Safety of Nuclear
Installations (&quot;ACSNI&quot;), would be asked to consider the approach to
site selection for radioactive waste disposal facilities and the criteria for
ensuring the protection of human health. 
</P>
<P>5.19 In August 1994, the Department of the Environment issued &quot;<I>Review
of Radioactive Waste Management Policy Preliminary Conclusions - A Consultation
Document</I>&quot; (&quot;<I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/306]. The summary of conclusions stated in paragraph 224:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continues to favour a policy of disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and high emitting wastes. It considers it
appropriate that Nirex should continue with its current site investigation
programme, including its application for planning permission for a rock
characterisation facility at Sellafield. Final decisions on the repository
itself must, however, depend on the establishment of a sound safety case, the
granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, as
well as costs. No fixed deadline should be set for the completion of this
process. In the meantime, the evidence as to safety and technology should be
kept under review, so that all can be satisfied that the eventual arrangements
are the best means by which this generation can fulfil its obligations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.20 On 9 May 1995, on publication of <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I>
[GOV/215], the Secretary of State for the Environment announced certain
conclusions of the Governments Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, in
advance of publication of a White Paper (which was subsequently published as
<I>the July 1995 White Paper</I>, [GOV/208]). In reply to a Parliamentary
Question <I>(Hansard)
</I>[GOV/212], he stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Government continue to favour a policy of deep disposal rather
than indefinite storage for ILW and consider it appropriate that Nirex should
continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. The question had been
raised of whether a delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might
have advantages. However, the review concluded that the balance of argument was
against any such delay. The Government therefore believe that the repository
should be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable once a suitable site has
been found, although the precise timetable will depend on the granting of
planning consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the
establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In relation to the planning inquiry into the RCF he said:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>I have already outlined the matters about which I particularly
wish to be informed to help me reach my decision on this case. These do not
include the merits of national policy on the deep disposal of ILW. It has been
established through the courts that while, of course, Government policy can be a
material consideration that may be taken into account at a local planning
inquiry, it may not be disputed and made a central area of debate. Policy on
deep disposal of ILW has, in any case, already been the subject of wide
consultation in the course of the review.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <I>Department of the Environment News Release </I>on 9 May 1995
[GOV/213], it was additionally stated: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.21 In May 1995, <I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> [GOV/215] itself
stated in paragraph 10.39:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I><B>Nirex and the deep repository</B>: The Government favours a
policy of deep disposal rather than indefinite storage for intermediate level
waste and believes that it is no longer right to postpone decisions about its
ultimate destination. It considers it appropriate that Nirex should continue
with its site investigation programme. The question had been raised of whether a
delay of 50 years in construction of the repository might have financial
advantages. However, financial appraisals showed little difference between
waiting 50 years or proceeding now. The review has concluded that the common
interest is in working towards developing the repository without unnecessary
delay, but allowing appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety
case and compliance with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.22 On 4 July 1995, the Government set out its radioactive waste management
policy in <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208]. The policy was stated in
paragraph 6 to have been framed &quot;<I>within the context of international
guidelines and regulations</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P>5.23 Paragraph 51 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> commented as follows
on the need to maintain a balance between costs and benefits:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<B>...<I>radioactive wastes should be managed and disposed of in
ways which protect the public, workforce and the environment. The radiation
protection principles and criteria adopted in the UK and applied by the
regulatory bodies are designed to ensure that there is no unacceptable risk
associated with radioactive waste management. In defining these principles and
criteria and in their application by the regulators, it is recognised that a
point is reached where additional costs of further reductions in risk exceed the
benefits arising from the improvements in safety achieved and that the level of
safety, and the resources required to achieve it, should not be inconsistent
with those accepted in other spheres of human activity.</I></B>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.24 In terms of fundamental policy on ILW, <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] states, as foreshadowed on 9 May 1995:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the Government continues to favour a policy of deep disposal
rather than indefinite storage for ILW and considers it appropriate that Nirex
should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site. It has decided
that there would be no advantage to be gained from delaying the development of
the repository itself, and that once a suitable site has been found, it should
be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. The precise timetable will
depend on the granting of planning consent and compliance with regulatory
requirements, including the establishment of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;(para.
101);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In 1991, Nirex announced that results of initial borehole drilling
and other investigations at the two sites </I>[Sellafield and Dounreay] <I>suggested
that either could potentially support the safety case necessary for a deep
disposal site, but that it proposed to concentrate its investigations on
Sellafield because of the advantages it offered in terms of transport, with the
majority of ILW for disposal arising from BNFL's operations at Sellafield. The
RCF would form part of those investigations.</I>&quot; (para. 109).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Summary
</B></P>
<P>5.25 The Government stated in 1986 its commitment to the early development
of a deep repository facility. The Secretary of State, in his <I>1989
Parliamentary Statement</I>, accepted Nirex's recommendations that a repository
should be constructed in the form of a mine under the land and that the next
steps should be to carry out detailed geological studies, including the sinking
of boreholes, in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay. The investigations
would enable Nirex to decide on the suitability of those sites for construction
of a repository or whether it would be necessary to evaluate others. Only when
such investigations had been undertaken would Nirex be in a position to submit
proposals for a substantive repository development and to seek the necessary
approvals. 
</P>
<P>5.26 The Government's 1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review
concluded that Nirex should work towards developing the deep repository without
any unnecessary delay and that once a suitable site has been found it should be
constructed as soon as reasonably practicable. Government stated in July 1995
that Nirex should continue with its programme to identify a suitable site and
that the RCF would form part of investigations which Nirex is undertaking at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P>5.27 The RCF proposal sits within a clear national policy context and is
consistent with it. 
</P>
<P> <B><A NAME="SiteSelection"></A>6. SITE SELECTION PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>6.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the procedures by
which Nirex decided to concentrate at Sellafield its site investigations for a
multi-purpose DWR.
</P>
<P>6.2 <I>The 1987 Parliamentary Statement</I> [GOV/210] explained that Nirex
would concentrate on identifying a suitable location for a deep multi-purpose
facility. I begin this part of my evidence by describing international guidance
and geological and hydrogeological considerations taken into account by Nirex in
framing its approach to site selection. As I shall describe, the Company
initiated public consultations in November 1987 to promote public understanding
of the issues involved and to stimulate comment which would assist Nirex in
developing acceptable proposals for location of a repository.

<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The IAEA is an inter&#173;governmental
organisation whose role is described in paragraph 8 of <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208]. In 1983 it published Safety Series report No. 59, <I>Disposal
of Low- and Intermediate-Level Solid Radioactive Wastes in Rock Cavities - A
Guidebook</I>, IAEA Vienna, 1983, (&quot;<I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>&quot;)
[GOV/501]. As described on its inside front cover, <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>was published as a category (3) document - Recommendations - issued under
the authority of the IAEA Director General. As indicated in the Foreword, it
contains guidelines to be used by regulatory bodies and implementing
organizations. Chapter 6 of the document includes general guidance on the site
selection process and Table 6.1 tabulated an <I>Idealized Sequence of
Activities for Site Selection</I>. 
</P>
<P>6.4 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>recommends, on page 19, that: &quot;<I>Repository
sites should be evaluated on the basis of geological and ecological information
as well as societal considerations</I>&quot;. Evaluation &quot;<I>is performed
in several stages, proceeding from generic to specific assessments</I>&quot;
(page 19) and: &quot;<I>The site selection should be undertaken in close
connection with the work for the repository concept and design, and if necessary
the introduction of engineered barriers should also be taken into account.</I>&quot;
(page 22.) 
</P>
<P>6.5 The idealised IAEA sequence of activities within the site selection
process comprises three stages: &quot;<I>Regional Evaluation</I>&quot;, &quot;<I>Site
Identification</I>&quot; and &quot;<I>Site Confirmation</I>&quot;. In paragraph
6.1.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] those stages of activity were described in broad
terms as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - a search on a national scale to define favourable areas of the
country; followed by</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the identification of specific candidate sites for comparative
evaluation and the selection of outstanding prospects for physical exploration
to confirm their suitability; and
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> - the final choice based on the results of geophysical investigation
and other studies.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.6 Regional Evaluation has the objective, as described in section 6.2 (page
23) of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... to select areas that have favourable characteristics for a
repository and to reduce them to a few preferred areas for further study. ...
Activities include ... geological mapping ... clarification of relevant
socio-economic factors and the performance of safety analyses.</I>&quot;<BR>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.7 Table 6.1 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] sees activities
to &quot;<I>characterize</I>&quot;  preliminary sites being undertaken
initially in the Site Identification stage and then, &quot;<I>in detail</I>&quot;,at
the third, Site Confirmation,<I></I>stage. During Site Confirmation, favourable
site(s) are selected and &quot;<I>Final Site Selection</I>&quot; follows.
</P>
<P>6.8 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501] states on page 19 that &quot;<I>it
may not prove feasible or necessary to move sequentially</I>&quot; through the
stages of site selection and continues &quot;<I>This may be the case if
potential sites or areas may be selected by means other than a full site
investigation programme...</I>&quot;. It states, on page 2, that the practical
application of the guidelines:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>... needs a case-by-case consideration, which takes into account
local conditions, e.g. natural circumstances, the characteristics of the wastes
and national and international regulations and practices.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 In commenting on rock suitability, <I>IAEA
Safety Series 59</I> [GOV/501] points out on page 9 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The suitability of the host rock will depend on individual
circumstances related to the specific site rather than the general properties of
the host rock type ... a final decision regarding the location of a radioactive
waste repository can only be made after a very careful, accurate and
comprehensive investigation of a given site and consideration of the waste
characteristics.</I>&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Identification of Geological Environments
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Following the withdrawal from Billingham in
1985, the Company sought advice from the British Geological Survey (&quot;BGS&quot;),
a research institute of the Natural Environment Research Council (&quot;NERC&quot;),
on generic geological environments suitable for ILW disposal. This led to
publication in 1986 of a BGS/Nirex paper <I>Geological Environments for Deep
Disposal of Intermediate Level Wastes in the United Kingdom</I> <I>IAEA-SM-289/37,
</I>(&quot;<I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper</I>&quot;), [COR/614]. The paper
explained on the second page that five generic geological environments had been
identified as suitable by reference to &quot;<I>requisite features</I>&quot;characterised
by:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> - predictable groundwater flow paths, preferably long and
resulting in progressive mixing with older, deeper waters or leading to
discharge at sea</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- very slow local and regional groundwater movements in an area with low
regional hydraulic gradients</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- ease of construction to allow for economic repository design 
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- meeting the many accepted caveats regarding seismicity, depth, etc.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.11 The paper distinguished that approach from &quot;<I>the old approach
to HLW disposal</I>&quot;, which had been summarised in a report of 1976 from
the Institute of Geological Sciences (predecessor of the BGS) <I>Disposal of
highly active, solid radioactive wastes into geological formations - relevant
geological criteria for the United Kingdom, IGS, Report No. 76/12</I> [COR/615].
The previous approach had put great emphasis on the properties of the host rock
itself where thermal stability, for example, was a key requirement in
considering suitability for HLW disposal. But, as described on the second page
of <I>the 1986 BGS/Nirex paper </I>[COR/614], in the light of &quot;<I>increased
understanding of low flux hydrogeological regimes and greater confidence in
modelling them</I>&quot;, near-field physical properties were seen to have
assumed previously &quot;<I>too great a significance in comparison with a
knowledge of long distance transport pathways</I>&quot;. Site selection needed &quot;<I>to
be primarily based on defining what are considered to be suitable large scale
hydrogeological environments</I>.&quot;
</P>
<P><U>The Way Forward</U></P>
<P>6.12 Nirex published in November 1987 <I>The Way Forward - A Discussion
Document</I> (&quot;<I>The Way Forward</I>&quot;) [COR/203]. The document
explained the Company's approach to deep disposal and options on repository
configurations and on generic hydrogeological environments likely to offer
potential for siting a repository. It posed a number of questions for discussion
on those matters, and on considerations bearing on selection of a repository
site and asked which locations should be the subject of detailed investigations.
</P>
<P>6.13 The Company explained in <I>The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] that it
intended to follow the three stage site selection process suggested by the IAEA.
The document itself reported progress with the first stage - Regional
Evaluation. It noted that work on the second stage - Site Identification - would
commence in 1988.</P>
<P>6.14 BNFL had announced on 14 September 1987 in its press release
<I>Waste Storage and Disposal</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1, that, with the
support of Nirex, it planned to conduct preliminary geological investigations
within its Sellafield site to assess whether the underground conditions might be
suitable for developing a deep disposal facility for ILW. The announcement
explained that a likely form of development could be that of a fully engineered
offshore depository below the seabed accessed by tunnel from the Sellafield
Works. <I>The Way Forward</I> welcomed this BNFL initiative (paragraph 6.3). It
noted that the Sellafield geology was more complex than other seaward-dipping
sediments, along the east of England, but was worth careful scrutiny because
Sellafield is the main source of ILW (paragraph 5.2.7).
</P>
<P>6.15 <I>The Way Forward </I>[COR/203] explained at paragraph 5.2.3 that,
taking the earlier advice from BGS, the five hydrogeological environments
defined as likely to offer potential for siting a deep repository were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(a) hard rocks in low relief terrain;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(b) small islands;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(c) seaward dipping and offshore sediments;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(d) inland basins of mixed sedimentary rocks; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) low permeability basement rocks under sedimentary cover (&quot;BUSC&quot;).

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Those environments were the five which had been described in <I>the 1986
BGS/Nirex paper</I> [COR/614]. Environments (a) to (c) were now identified as &quot;<I>the
preferred group</I>&quot;with their hydrogeological structures seen as simple
and consequently more predictable. It was thought likely that those three
environments would yield a sufficient number of sites suitable for investigation
(see paragraph 5.2.5 of <I>The Way Forward</I>).

<P><U>Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council Responses</U></P>
<P>6.16 In a letter to Nirex of 17 March 1988, reproduced in NRX/12/2, Cumbria
County Council gave its preliminary reactions to <I>The Way Forward</I>
[COR/203]. This followed a resolution of the Planning and Environment
Sub-Committee of the Economy and Environment Committee of the Council, on 14
December 1987, reproduced in NRX/12/2. Particular observations in the letter
which are relevant to site selection include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on locations which should be the subject of discussion, the County
Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It seems that at this stage the best course is to keep both the hard
rock and coastal sediment options open to enable detailed designs to be evolved
and costed so that Cumbria can be aware of the detailed arguments. This is in
line with the Council's previous request that a general inquiry be held on waste
disposal policy. Without prejudice to any future position which may be taken,
the County Council, therefore, supports BNF's investigation of an off-Sellafield
facility, at least as far as full geophysical research.</I>&quot; (para. e<I>.</I>);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>the County Council &quot;<I>strongly</I>&quot;<I> </I>advocated, in
paragraph (f) of the letter, &quot;<I>early moves to provide proper final
disposal</I>&quot; subject to airing the issue of recoverability fully at a
public inquiry; and 
</LI>
<LI>on local liaison arrangements the County Council's view was:
</LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>Nirex should be encouraged to proceed with full investigations which
would include BNF's proposed option. Once the geophysical work is complete and
preferably during it, the County's officers and consultants should have access
to the thinking and judgments on which any conclusions are reached. Nirex should
subject their preferred proposals (perhaps at more than one location) to a full
Environmental Impact Study (as now required under the EEC Environmental
Directive)...</I>&quot;<I> </I>(Sub-para. h(iii).)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.17 Copeland Borough Council's response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
consultation was given in a letter to Nirex of 11 December 1987 reproduced in
NRX/12/2. It noted that local support was &quot;<I>secondary to finding the
'best' site</I>&quot;<I> </I>and emphasised that safety was the central issue.
In a press statement of 14 September 1987 reproduced in NRX/12/1, the Borough
Council had previously given a qualified welcome to the BNFL initiative, and
noted that an ILW facility at Sellafield could well satisfy local concern
regarding the management practices for radioactive waste then existing. The
proposals were described as providing &quot;<I>a basis for serious discussion</I>&quot;
antepenultimate paragraph of the 14 September press statement).

<P><U>The RWMAC Response to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.18 In July 1988, the RWMAC published its response to <I>The Way Forward</I>
in its <I>Report of the RWMAC Sub-Group on the Nirex Proposals for Deep Site
Investigation</I> (&quot;<I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I>&quot;)
[GOV/412]. It welcomed the definition of the five potential rock environments,
though commenting that they had been presented as essentially simplified
hydrogeological models still to be tested against site-specific locations. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.19"></A>6.19 In response to the question whether an adequate
site which enjoys local support should be preferred to an apparently superior
site which does not, <I>the RWMAC Response to The Way Forward</I> [GOV/412]
stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The search for a suitable site must not go on indefinitely; there
is little advantage in searching for a 'Rolls-Royce' solution if Nirex finds the
answer in a 'Jaguar' ... This requires Nirex to find a site with a risk to the
critical group at no more than one in a million per annum and with exposures as
low as reasonably achievable, taking into account economic and social factors.
These criteria must not be relinquished or compromised to meet the assessment
results ... We support, therefore, a pragmatic approach to site selection but on
the basis of a fixed set of assessment criteria.</I>&quot; (para. 12);
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However we also recognise the difficulty of identifying more than
one site publicly without attracting the 'not in my back yard' approach.
Consequently, we accept that Nirex may wish to follow its consultation and
technical studies by nominating one site for investigation prior to development,
rather than a short-list of sites requiring site-specific investigation before a
definite choice could be made.</I>&quot; (para. 13.)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>University of East Anglia Report on Responses to <I>The Way Forward</I></U></P>
<P>6.20 The responses to <I>The Way Forward</I> consultation were analysed on
the Company's behalf in a November 1988 report <I>Responses to The Way Forward</I>
by the <I>Environmental Risk Assessment Unit of the School of Environmental
Sciences, University of East Anglia </I>(&quot;<I>the UEA Study</I>&quot;)
[COR/204]. There was found to be no overall unanimity of view. Amongst local
authorities, some supported underground disposal and others on-site storage of
wastes as an alternative. However, local authorities with nuclear installations
in their areas, and advisory and scientific bodies, did not on the whole support
such storage. For all consultees, safety was judged the paramount factor, with
the safe transport of wastes being the next major area of concern. In procedural
terms, there was a general welcome for the consultation exercise and opposition
to use of the Special Development Order procedure for obtaining planning
permission for investigative drilling or subsequent development.
</P>
<P>6.21 Appendix E to<I> PERA </I>[COR/501] summarised the results of <I>the
UEA study </I>[COR/204]. Paragraph 6.7.8 of <I>PERA
</I>stated that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The only areas of the country where local authorities</I>
<I>did show a measure of support </I>[for deep disposal] <I>were Caithness
(Scotland) and Copeland (Cumbria), which were already familiar with the nuclear
industry developments at Dounreay and Sellafield respectively.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nirex took that position, and other views expressed from outside the nuclear
industry, into account in its work on site selection. 
</P>
<P><B>Areas of Search
</B></P>
<P>6.22 Nirex's procedures through 1988 and into 1989 followed the IAEA
guidelines outlined at paragraphs 6.3 to 6.9 above. Also, as noted at paragraph
6.1.3 of <I>PERA</I>, the Company had regard for the guidance contained in <I>the
Green Book</I>. The Company's March 1989 announcement nominating Dounreay and
Sellafield as locations for further investigations was accompanied by
publication of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] which gives extensive commentary on the
Company's work on various aspects of the DWR programme following the public
consultation during 1987 and 1988. My description of the site selection
procedures which were followed sets those procedures within the IAEA framework
of guidance. Nirex's first step - the definition of Areas of Search within which
specific sites can subsequently be identified - equated to the IAEA Regional
Evaluation stage.
</P>
<P>6.23 As noted on page 24 of<I> The Way Forward</I> [COR/203] three
potentially suitable types of hydrogeological environment were, on advice from
the BGS, the starting point for the definition in 1987 of Areas of Search.
Paragraph 6.4.1 of <I>PERA </I>[COR/501] explained that reassessments of
suitable rock environments, based on further recommendations from the BGS,
subsequently led to revised Areas of Search, which included the BUSC environment
as well as hard rocks in low relief terrain, small islands and potentially
suitable sedimentary formations. As illustrated in Figure 6.2 of <I>PERA</I>,
some 30% of the land area of Great Britain was classified within the four
hydrogeologically promising environments. 
</P>
<P>6.24 As explained in Chapter 6 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], Nirex engaged
Pieda, Planning, Economic and Development Consultants, to advise on planning
matters. Recognising the need to avoid if at all possible areas designated as
being of national importance from the standpoint of conservation, these were
mapped on a national scale and excluded from further consideration. The areas
concerned included National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Heritage
Coastlines, National Scenic Areas and National Nature Reserves. Also, in the
light of public perception of the acceptability of a repository nearby and the
desirability of minimising disturbance created by its construction and
operation, Local Districts and Boroughs with a population density of more than 5
persons per hectare were excluded from the search. The exclusions in respect of
population density, planning and nature conservation considerations were
illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report</I>
[GOV/402] published in November 1989. Figure 6.3 of<I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed
the reduced Areas of Search on land. 
</P>
<P>6.25 In delineating offshore areas of the continental shelf potentially
suitable for the development of a sub-seabed repository, Nirex took advice from
the BGS; the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, a research institute of the
NERC; and Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited.
</P>
<P>6.26 These studies completed, in IAEA terminology, the Regional Evaluation
stage. In subsequent work, consistently with <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>,
consideration was given to some sites outside the Areas of Search which appeared
to offer particularly favourable features coupled with a satisfactory geology
(see paragraph 6.5.1 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501]).
</P>
<P><B>Identification and Review of Specific Sites
</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.27"></A>6.27 Maps of the Areas of Search were studied to
identify sites which appeared worthy of consideration for potential DWR
development. As mentioned at paragraph 6.26 above, some sites outside those
areas were also brought into consideration. Consultations were undertaken with
Government Departments and other public sector bodies having significant land
holdings, as well as with Shareholders in Nirex. The Company, working in
conjunction with the BGS and Pieda, identified about 500 sites, many
publicly-owned. Privately-owned sites offered to the Company were incorporated
in the list.
</P>
<P><U>Sieving Process</U></P>
<P>6.28 The Company refined and reduced its list of candidate sites through a
sequential sieving process, taking appropriate expert advice at each stage. This
part of the process was summarised in Figure 6.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and I
describe each stage below.
</P>
<P>6.29 A first sieving was undertaken, in conjunction with the BGS and Pieda,
to evaluate in a preliminary way the specific geological settings of each site
and to take account of environmental and planning factors not covered by the
initial exclusions made in defining Areas of Search. These included a review of
whether sites were designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and
whether, although in administrative districts of low population density, they
were adjacent to major population centres. About 200 sites with real potential
were carried forward from this stage. 
</P>
<P>6.30 The next stage of the sieving process, conducted in conjunction with
Pieda, was a closer review of site ownership. In particular, certain small
island sites had been included in the list of about 500 in the knowledge that
their ownership was uncertain. Many of those islands remaining on the list of
about 200 were set aside once their ownership was clarified. About 160 sites
were carried forward to the next stage.
</P>
<P>6.31 Then, as described in paragraph 6.5.5 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further consideration was given to the configuration and area of the land
available at each site. Areal guidelines were drawn up with the advice of a
consortium, led by Costain Engineering Limited. and including Ove Arup and
Partners and Electrowatt Engineering Services (UK) Limited., having extensive
experience of major engineering design and construction projects in the nuclear
industry, including waste disposal. The guidelines were, for inland sites, 400
hectares and, for coastal sites, 200 hectares encompassing the maximum likely
requirements for surface facilities, the repository itself being under the sea.
The guidelines were not applied too rigorously as the land-take was seen to be
site-specific, though in <I>PERA</I> an area of 85 hectares was foreseen as
sufficient for a reference repository design under the land at either Dounreay
or Sellafield. 
</P>
<P>6.32 About 120 sites were carried forward from that stage. The geological
setting for each site remaining under consideration was then examined in further
detail by the BGS. A geological profile of each site was prepared to enable
assessment of its likely hydrogeological characteristics. Candidates likely to
perform best in hydrogeological terms were selected, with 39 sites being taken
forward.<BR>
</P>
<P><U>Identification of the Sellafield BVG as a Siting Option</U></P>
<P>6.33 The volcanic rocks beneath the Windscale (now Sellafield) Works were
described in a 1980 report from the Institute of Geological Sciences (now the
BGS) [COR/616 ], as holding &quot;<I>good</I>&quot; potential for ILW disposal
(see Figure 2, page 4 of COR/616). Beneath the Sellafield Works, they were,
however, estimated to lie 900 m bOD and the cost of investigating them at depth
was described as &quot;<I>likely to be prohibitive</I>&quot;. The potential for
burial of radioactive waste within the overlying sandstones was described as &quot;<I>limited</I>&quot;<I></I>although
&quot;<I>repository design could be envisaged whereby any leachate is allowed
to flow through the </I>[sandstone]<I>formation eventually to discharge into
the Irish Sea</I>&quot;. (Page 7-9 of Appendix 7 to COR/616.) 
</P>
<P>6.34 During 1988, desk-based studies of the Sellafield area indicated that,
just inland from the Sellafield Works, under land owned by BNFL, the volcanic
basement rock - the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (&quot;BVG&quot;) - was at an
accessible depth. Therefore, within the terms of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59,
</I>the possibility of siting a repository in that setting was introduced as a
second Sellafield option alongside the original sedimentary option beneath the
Sellafield Works, when the list of 39 locations was reviewed. As noted on page
24 of the April 1989 Nirex publication
<I>Going Forward, the development of a national disposal centre for low and
intermediate level radioactive waste</I> (&quot;<I>Going Forward</I>&quot;)<I></I>[COR/209],
the BVG option was an area of basement rock under sedimentary cover.
</P>
<P>6.35 In reviewing the 39 locations, evaluations of key factors bearing on
site suitability were prepared by Nirex, the BGS, Pieda and a team of specialist
consultants. Post-closure radiological safety, repository design and transport
were covered by, respectively, the UKAEA, the consortium led by Costain and JMP
Consultants. The Company established site availability by consulting the owners.

</P>
<P>6.36 This phase of the procedure focused on progressive evaluation of
specific sites on a comparative basis with interactive expert judgments applied
to determine which sites best justified further assessment. It resulted in 17 of
the land-based sites being taken forward. For the Sellafield site, both the
volcanic and sedimentary options remained under consideration.
</P>
<P>6.37 As set out in paragraphs 6.5.8 to 6.5.14 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501],
further review of the 17 land-based sites was undertaken with advice from the
team of specialist consultants. The respective consultants assessed the merits
of each candidate site in relation to the disposal concept(s) which it could
potentially satisfy. Development Plans were taken into account by considering
publicly-available information on the current and future proposed use of land in
the locality of each site. Preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared
on a generic basis for repositories constructed and operated in various rock
environments. The BGS advised on uncertainties in the existing geological data
on each site and how readily better data could be obtained by ground
investigations. Ten land-based options - including both the Sellafield
sedimentary option and the Sellafield BVG option - went forward from this
process.
</P>
<P>6.38 As described at paragraph 6.4.4 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] and at
paragraph 6.25 of my evidence, work was done to define areas of the continental
shelf potentially suitable for sub-seabed disposal of radioactive waste. Two
generic offshore options were defined, in hard rock and sedimentary rock. Advice
was taken from Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons Limited and NEI Limited on the
design of offshore access systems.
</P>
<P>6.39 Thus twelve options - 10 on land and two offshore - were carried
forward into a quantified comparative evaluation. Multi-attribute decision
analysis (&quot;MADA&quot;) was employed for this purpose with the advice of
Professor Lawrence Phillips of the Decision Analysis Unit of the London School
of Economics and Political Science.
</P>
<P><U>MADA</U></P>
<P>6.40 MADA is established as an appropriate tool for applying logic
systematically to help make choices between options which have to be assessed
with respect to multiple and varied attributes. Paragraph 4.23 of the report of
the Study Group drawn from the members of the RWMAC and ACSNI, <I>Site
Selection for Radioactive Waste Disposal Facilities and the Protection of Human
Health</I>,<I>March 1995</I>, (&quot;<I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>&quot;)
[GOV/409] noted its use by the Department of the Environment in assessment of
options for radioactive waste management. Under the MADA process, the weightings
applied to scores on different attributes of each option depend both on the
intrinsic importance of the attribute concerned and its discriminatory relevance
given the characteristics of the set from which choice is being made. Generally,
if on a particular attribute the options score close together then a relatively
lower weight is appropriate for that attribute.
</P>
<P>6.41 A note supplied to Cumbria County Council in November 1994, reproduced
on pages 97-119 of <I>the Report by the Director of Economy and Environment
Cumbria County Council, December </I>1994 (&quot;<I>the November 1994 Note</I>&quot;)
(COR/104 pages 97&#173;119), described how all the 12 short-listed options were
seen to have the potential to meet the post-closure safety target, which <I>the
Green Book </I>(paragraph 3.8) had expressed as equivalent to an individual
annual dose not exceeding 0.1 mSv. Moreover, the established radiological safety
principle, recently reaffirmed in paragraph 78 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper
</I>[GOV/208] and recognised in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I>
[GOV/409] (see paragraphs 3.37-3.38), is that, provided certain conditions are
met, no further reduction in risk should be sought if the estimated risk to the
public is below the target level. Thus, in ranking the 12 options, the margins
by which particular sites might give an estimated annual dose below 0.1 mSv were
relatively unimportant. Accordingly, a low weight was applied to this site
attribute in the MADA process.
</P>
<P>6.42 The MADA procedure, as detailed in <I>the November 1994 Note
</I>[COR/104 pages 97-119] took account of the site attributes grouped into four
collective branches of costs, robustness, safety and environment. Thirty
individual attributes were accorded weightings through a structured process of
expert elicitation and judgment facilitated by Professor Phillips.
Representatives of the consultants BGS, JMP Consultants, Pieda and the UKAEA, as
well as Nirex staff, participated in this process.
</P>
<P>6.43 The assessment and scoring of each site's performance under each of the
30 attributes within the four branches was undertaken by experts using the best
available data and information on each site. Definitions of the 30 attributes
and information about scores were summarised in Annex 1 to <I>the November 1994
Note</I> (see pages 111-119 of COR/104).
</P>
<P>6.44 Information on geological conditions - relevant to scoring a number of
attributes - was supplied by the BGS, drawing on the national geological records
which it maintains and site visits. Environmental information took account of
data obtained by Pieda, from local authorities and from visits to each location
to assess potential impacts.
</P>
<P>6.45 Designs and cost estimates for repositories appropriate to the
geological settings at each land-based location were prepared by the consortium
led by Costain and, for the offshore options, by Sir Robert McAlpine and Sons
Limited and NEI Limited. Those engineering consultants also provided estimates
of operational safety. JMP Consultants advised on the design of transport
systems, their environmental and safety implications and transport costs for
each site. UKAEA assessed the potential post-closure safety performance of the
different geological settings.
</P>
<P>6.46 As explained in <I>the November 1994 Note</I> (COR/104 pages 97-119),
in the base case for analysis the weights set for the four collective branches
of attributes were as follows:

<P>6.47 Cost was a discriminating attribute across the 12 options and was given
a weighting of 71.4 percentage points. With about half the wastes for deep
disposal arising at Sellafield and rail infrastructure in place there, transport
costs were a major influence on the ranking for that site. By contrast, the base
case weighting attached to local experience of nuclear matters - on which
Sellafield also scored well - was only 1.3 percentage points within the 7.1
percentage points for 'environment' factors overall. 
</P>
<P>6.48 Paragraph 4.1.8 of<I> the November 1994 Note </I>(see page 106 of
[COR/104]) explained that, in the MADA analysis, the Sellafield BVG option
ranked first on the basis of its attribute scores and base case weightings.
Under sensitivity analysis, in which weightings were altered to test the effect
on overall evaluations, the Sellafield BVG was consistently numbered amongst a
leading group of sites which tended to score consistently well. Dounreay
generally scored in the top half of the rankings. 
</P>
<P><U>Wide range of options</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.49"></A>6.49 The Company's procedures, as I have described
them, kept a wide range of options under review through the definition of Areas
of Search and in the Identification and Review of Specific Sites. As well as
land-based options, on the British mainland and small islands, there was study
of offshore options involving sub-seabed disposal via purpose-built structures.
The differing levels of potential radiological performance of widely differing
siting options were taken into account. Thus, the shortlist of 12 sites was
composed of land-based candidates from each of the four rock environments - at
least the leading two options within each environment - and offshore concepts in
hard rock and sedimentary rock.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.50"></A>6.50 Results from an early exercise to assess the
potential safety performance of the four generic environments on land, the
offshore options and the Sellafield basement setting were given in Table 5.2 of
<I>PERA </I>[COR/501]. The results suggested that an offshore repository in
hard rock under deep water would give the smallest post-closure dose to an
individual. Inclusive of the effects of other processes not then captured in the
MASCOT computer program (which is described in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para4.10">4.10</A> of Dr Hooper's evidence <B>PE/NRX/15</B>)
the estimated individual dose for the groundwater pathway was 0.0006 mSv per
year. As explained in <I>PERA </I>in paragraph 6.6.10, conventional safety
considerations told against the offshore options. Under the MADA evaluation the
hard-rock offshore option - despite an indicated post-closure radiological risk
markedly lower than others - was not a preferred choice overall.
</P>
<P><U>Selection of Dounreay and Sellafield for Further Investigation</U></P>
<P>6.51 As stated at paragraph 6.7.2 of <I>PERA </I>(COR/501), while the site
selection process was founded on the approach which I have now described above,
Nirex &quot;<I>also sought to explore the broader social context in which it is
required to discharge its technical responsibilities</I>&quot;. Both <I>the
November 1994 Note</I>, in paragraph 4.1.9 (see page 106 of COR/104), and<I>PERA</I>
(see paragraphs 6.7.2-6.7.11) noted that, through the Way Forward consultation,
only in Caithness and Copeland had local authorities shown a degree of support
for deep disposal. Also, as noted at paragraphs 6.16 and 6.17 above, both
Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council had responded constructively
to the BNFL initiative of September 1987 to undertake preliminary geological
investigations at Sellafield. Nirex's decision in 1989 was, as a first step, to
limit further investigations to Dounreay and Sellafield, as two short-listed
locations &quot;<I>where there is a measure of public support</I>&quot; (see
<I>PERA</I>, paragraph 6.7.11). The priorities set as a result of applying that
consideration were not out of line with the results of the MADA evaluation, as
described at paragraph 6.48 above.
</P>
<P>6.52 The existence of a measure of public support in the Sellafield area is
confirmed by the opinion survey results mentioned at paragraphs 4.26 to 4.29
above.
</P>
<P>6.53 The RWMAC visited the Company in November 1988 to seek an update on
site selection studies and a sub-group of RWMAC reviewed the site selection
process adopted by Nirex (see paragraphs 2.1 and 2.24 of <I>the RWMAC Tenth
Annual Report</I>). As I have already described, the Government's 1989
acceptance of the Nirex recommendation on Dounreay and Sellafield took account
of the RWMAC advice on the site selection procedures adopted by the Company (see
Appendix C of <I>the RWMAC Tenth Annual Report, </I>November 1989 [GOV/402]).
The advice described the approach which had been followed by Nirex as &quot;<I>defensible</I>&quot;and
accepted &quot;<I>the logic in identifying the two areas for further evaluation
which include the nuclear installations of Dounreay and Sellafield</I>&quot;. 
</P>
<P><B>Concentration of Investigations at Sellafield
</B></P>
<P>6.54 As explained in Chapter 9 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501], subject to the
progress of the geological investigations, and specifically to the start of
on-site work by mid-1989, it was considered that after a period of some 18
months - i.e. by the autumn of 1989 - it should be possible to reach a first
decision point. At that point, it would be determined whether either Sellafield
or Dounreay or both sites would be suitable for construction of a repository or
whether other locations should be evaluated. Detailed ground investigations
would then follow at the preferred site, together with further detailed studies
of all relevant aspects of repository development to support preparation of a
Detailed Environmental and Radiological Assessment to accompany a planning
application to construct a repository.
</P>
<P>6.55 Conceptual design illustrations for a DWR in hard rock given in Figure
4.2 of <I>PERA</I> [COR/501] showed an Underground Laboratory, at the
repository horizon, adjacent to the access shaft. A Sellafield brochure
accompanying <I>Going Forward </I>[included in COR/208] in 1989 explained in
more detail that, once DWR planning permission had been granted:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I> ... the first stages will be to construct the surface facilities,
the main entry shafts and an experimental area. This experimental area will be
used to further develop the understanding of the behaviour of the surrounding
geology. This will be of value both to the safety research teams and the
construction teams, who will require detailed information on the physical
properties of the rock in order to continue to refine the safety analysis and
disposal centre designs.</I>&quot; (page 8.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.56 A Briefing Note prepared for external use on 6 December 1989 gave the
Company's updated view on the next steps. <I>Preliminary Investigations at
Sellafield and Dounreay </I>(reproduced in NRX/12/1) reported that no planning
approvals had been received for borehole drilling at either Dounreay or
Sellafield except that for Borehole 1 at Sellafield, granted by the Secretary of
State on appeal on 21 March 1989. Nomination of a preferred site for further
investigation was expected in 1992. Following the further investigation, it was
envisaged that a planning application to construct a DWR would lead to a Public
Inquiry in 1994. The Briefing Note explained that future underground
investigations:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; <I>... may include the drilling of horizontal boreholes to intersect
features of interest from a central underground research facility.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.57 Shaft sinking and investigations underground were planned to be
undertaken following grant of planning permission for the DWR. Results from
surface-based investigation alone were expected to be sufficient for the safety
assessment which would underpin a decision to submit a planning application to
develop a repository. My letter of 21 January 1992 to County Council, reproduced
in NRX/12/2, explained a forward programme which reflected that continuing
assumption.
</P>
<P><U>Preliminary Geological Results</U></P>
<P>6.58 In line with the announced intention to nominate a preferred site for
further investigations, in July 1991 the Company reviewed preliminary results
available from the geological and hydrogeological investigations at Dounreay and
Sellafield. These results were not fed into models of post-closure safety
performance or, at that stage, subjected to formal interpretation. But, as in
1989, both were judged to have the potential to support an acceptable
post-closure safety case. Much further work was recognised to be required before
a long-term safety case could be made. 
</P>
<P><B>Conclusion
</B></P>
<P>6.59 The Company was conscious of the cost of geological investigations - in
1991 the cost of drilling a single deep borehole was typically &#163;5 million -
and of the demands on highly-specialised scientific manpower of investigating
two sites in parallel. The risks to the programme of concentrating as planned on
a single preferred site were judged acceptable. Accordingly, it was decided to
concentrate investigations on Sellafield in the light of the initial results
from physical investigations, the major transport advantages of Sellafield
viewed as a candidate repository location, and the fact that expert assessments
of other attributes of the two locations showed little change. The intention was
to decide on an application for repository planning permission in October 1992,
subject to the results from on-going safety assessment work.
</P>
<P>6.60 The Company's decision and the background to it were explained in a
Nirex news release of 23 July 1991 <I>UK Nirex Chooses Sellafield as Preferred
Site </I>reproduced in NRX/12/1. The news release stated that approximately 60%
of the radioactive waste destined for the repository arises from BNFL operations
at Sellafield. Dounreay was explained to remain a reserve option should
Sellafield prove unsuitable. It was stated that a full analysis of the Dounreay
results, alongside those from Sellafield, would be undertaken prior to a
decision to submit a planning application for a repository. Letters of 22 July
1991 from the Company to Cumbria County Council and Copeland Borough Council
(reproduced in NRX/12/2) explained:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The decision to concentrate on Sellafield does not mean that we
have yet decided to submit a planning application for the construction of a
repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Publication of Dounreay Site Investigation Results</U></P>
<P>6.61 In December 1994, Nirex published detailed geological and
hydrogeological interpretations of Dounreay based on the investigations done
there. The findings were summarised in a report entitled
<I>The Geology and Hydrogeology of Dounreay, Executive Summary, Nirex Report
653, December 1994</I> [COR/506].</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFSite"></A>7. THE RCF AND SITE CONFIRMATION</B></P>
<P>7.1 Through the second half of 1991 and into 1992, the Company continued to
review geological and hydrogeological results from Sellafield to assess the
implications of these for the potential post-closure safety performance of a DWR
located in the BVG. By the end of 1991, four deep boreholes had been completed.
Further information from geophysical surveys was also available. A preliminary
geological interpretation based on these data was provided to Cumbria County
Council as<I> Nirex Report 263 The Geology and Hydrogeology of Sellafield</I>
[COR/502] in March 1992. <I>Nirex Report 268 Sellafield Hydrogeology</I>
[COR/521], giving a preliminary hydrogeological interpretation, was published in
August 1992. 
</P>
<P>7.2 In May 1992, the Company reviewed early results from a preliminary
safety assessment for a DWR at Sellafield based on data and interpretations
available from the site investigations. The indicated peak mean risk to a
representative member of the critical group via the groundwater pathway was
below the 10<SUP>-6</SUP> risk target for a repository, which was encouraging.
The Company recognised, however, that the estimates were preliminary and that
other conceptual models of the hydrogeology, some of which would imply worse
repository performance, remained plausible given the limited data available.
Drawing firm conclusions from interpretations and modelling based on data from
an actual site - as distinct from desk-based simplifications - was proving a
more extended task than was envisaged in 1991. 
</P>
<P>7.3 Nirex decided to continue the drilling programme at Sellafield and to
postpone a decision on submitting a repository planning application. The revised
aim was to reach a decision on submitting a repository planning application by
the autumn of 1993, based on interpretation of results from the Company's
continuing site investigation programme. The rescheduling was explained in
letters of 1 June 1992 from the Company to Cumbria County Council, Copeland
Borough Council and copied to the Lake District Special Planning Board and the
Six Parishes Committee, reproduced in NRX/12/2. The overall picture was seen by
the Company as &quot;<I>so far, so good</I>&quot;, as described in the Nirex
news release of 2 June 1992, <I>Further Investigations by UK Nirex at
Sellafield</I>, reproduced in NRX/12/1.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.4"></A>7.4 Following the May 1992 decision, Nirex continued
to review the forward programme. To provide an adequate basis for reaching a
decision on proposing repository development, more certainty was required on the
potential safety performance of a DWR at Sellafield. In particular, firmer
interpretations of the hydrogeology were needed, in which the range of
conceptualisations supportable by expert judgments could be reduced.
</P>
<P>7.5 The Company concluded that an early planning application to develop a
repository at Sellafield would be unlikely to be approved. The assessment work
on post-closure safety was giving encouraging results. However, without
confirmatory information from exploratory excavation, the Company judged the
picture would be too uncertain to allow the authorising Departments to give a
meaningful &quot;<I>provisional view</I>&quot;<I> </I>on whether a proposed
repository &quot;<I>would be suitable for authorisation</I>&quot; before a
public inquiry were &quot;<I>held into whether planning permission should be
granted to construct such a facility</I>&quot;. This was the procedure provided
for at paragraph 1.3 on page 6 of <I>the Green Book</I> [GOV/302].
</P>
<P>7.6 The only practicable way forward was to undertake the planned
exploratory excavations before, rather than after, submitting a planning
application for a DWR. In September 1992, the Company agreed a contingent,
staged approach to the repository programme with only the RCF being developed
initially. The governing concept was that of a 'super-borehole', implying
minimum outlays and environmental disturbance.
</P>
<P>7.7 Development of the RCF will give the necessary opportunity to perform in
situ experiments and will be part of the Site Confirmation stage defined in
Chapter6 of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59
</I>[GOV/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.8"></A>7.8 If, during Site Confirmation, the Company judges
the prospective post-closure safety performance of a repository in the
Sellafield BVG to be acceptable and repository construction is confirmed to be
safe at acceptable cost, then it would be ready to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield. As described in paragraph 9.12 below, it would need to
be confident before making such a proposal that the regulatory authorities would
foresee no impediment, in the light of the information available to them, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.9"></A>7.9 In the UK, Final Site Selection, in the
terminology of <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 59</I>, is a matter for the developer
who, having selected the site, will submit a planning application for
development of the DWR and applications for authorisation of waste disposal
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and for licensing of the site under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The &quot;<I>appropriate authorities</I>&quot;
- including the local planning authorities and the regulatory authorities -
would thus be provided with information on the proposal &quot;<I>to permit
decisions to be made</I>&quot;under those statutes&quot;<I>for final site
selection and subsequent licensing</I>&quot; (see section 6.5 of <I>IAEA Safety
Series No. 59 </I>[GOV/501]). Such decisions would of course be subject to the
Company satisfying all planning and environmental requirements relating to
development of a repository at Sellafield. 
</P>
<P><U>Liaison with the County and District Councils</U></P>
<P>7.10 On 14 July 1992, Copeland Borough Council adopted a formal resolution
on the Nirex Investigation Programme, as indicated in a letter to the Company of
10 August 1992, reproduced in NRX/12/2. It provided, inter alia, that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Consideration of an underground rock laboratory, which is site
specific, be supported in principle without any commitment to the repository
proposal</I>&quot;<I>.</I> (para. d.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.11 During 15-17 September 1992 the Company led a visit to the sp rock
laboratory at Oskarshamn in Sweden and to the underground repository at
Olkiluoto in Finland. A number of officers and Members from Cumbria County
Council and Copeland Borough Council joined the visit, during which there was
informal discussion about the possibility of the concept of a site-specific rock
laboratory at Sellafield.
</P>
<P>7.12 The Nirex Technical Director wrote to Cumbria County Council and to
Copeland Borough Council on 7 October 1992 about the Company's RCF plans (see
NRX/12/2). The <I>Sellafield Repository Project, A Rock Characterisation
Facility Consultative Document, </I>(&quot;<I>Nirex Report 327</I>&quot;)
[COR/504] was published on 21 October 1992 and gave a fuller description of the
purposes of the RCF. These included providing information required to make a
firmer assessment of the long-term safety of a repository, confirming
assumptions regarding repository location and design and enabling cost estimates
to be refined.
</P>
<P><U>Development of the RCF Concept</U></P>
<P>7.13 Subsequent to the September 1992 decision to propose the RCF as a
free-standing development, the Company developed the concept in detail. It took
account of responses to <I>Nirex Report 327</I> [COR/504] and, in refining the
scientific work to be carried out in the RCF programme, of further information
emerging from the continuing programme of surface-based investigations. A
project team developed detailed specifications and costings for the RCF. 
</P>
<P>7.14 In March 1993 planning permission was granted by Cumbria County Council
for temporary development needed to drill RCF monitoring and centre-line
boreholes at Longlands Farm. These boreholes were required to build the
necessary understanding of existing geological and hydrogeological conditions at
the site, and subsequently to monitor the effects of RCF construction on those
conditions. Updated interpretations of the Sellafield geology and hydrogeology
were published in <I>the Geology and Hydrogeology of the Sellafield Area:
Interim Assessment. December 1993</I>, <I>Nirex Report 524</I>, [COR/517] and
the accompanying <I>Nirex Report 525 Scientific Update 1993</I> [COR/505]
explained the current status of the Company's Science Programme, including the
continued development of its approach to modelling of post-closure safety
performance of a repository.
</P>
<P>7.15 In January 1994, with the borehole drilling at Longlands Farm well
under way, the Company adopted as a key objective the securing of early planning
approval for the RCF. Following detailed consultation through the NLG about a
draft Environmental Statement, a planning application and accompanying
documentation were submitted on 29 July 1994.
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Review"></A>8. REVIEW OF THE NIREX APPROACH</B></P>
<P><B>Government Views on Nirex Approach
</B></P>
<P>8.1 A recommendation in <I>the RWMAC/ACSNI Study Group Report</I> [GOV/409]
(see paragraph 5.35) was that, for repository site selection decisions already
made, there be a careful, conscious matching of the process adopted against the
multiple phases of a new approach recommended by the Group. In response, in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] (paras. 106-110) the Government set down the
results of a consideration of whether Nirex has adopted a reasonable approach in
its investigations so far.
</P>
<P>8.2 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> describes how the Government accepted
Nirex's 1989 recommendation to explore first Dounreay and Sellafield to decide
on their suitability as sites for a repository. It notes the subsequent
concentration of investigations on Sellafield because of the advantages that
that site offered in terms of transport, and that the RCF would form part of
those investigations. It makes no recommendation for a different approach.
</P>
<P>8.3 At paragraph 110 of <I>the July 1995 White Paper</I> the Government
states the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The matters about which the Secretary of State has said he
specifically wishes to be informed by the public inquiry into the RCF concern
the local impact of the facility's construction. The Government has already
promised to hold a full public inquiry into an application for the repository
itself, wherever it may be situated. The Government sees no reason to depart
from this procedure.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Views of Independent Bodies on the RCF Proposal
</B></P>
<P>8.4 Independent bodies have indicated their support for the RCF proposal, as
Dr Holmes explains more fully in Section 7 of his Proof of Evidence. I mention
here briefly the views of the RWMAC and of a Royal Society Study Group.
</P>
<P>8.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
states (paragraph 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>8.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) [COR/605],
published in November 1994, concluded in Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause. International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>IAEA Site Selection Framework
</B></P>
<P>8.7 The Nirex approach, including the RCF as an essential part of the Site
Confirmation stage, is consistent with the recommendations in<I> IAEA Safety
Series No. 59</I> [GOV/501]. It is also consistent with a Safety Guide published
by the IAEA in 1994 <I>IAEA Safety Series No. 111 - G-4.1 Siting of Geological
Disposal Facilities A Safety Guide - A Publication within the RADWASS Programme</I>
[GOV/507]. That document refines the description of the site selection process.
It distinguishes explicitly a screening phase - comparable to that adopted by
Nirex - which is applied after geological, hydrogeological and other features
are considered, within the Area Survey Stage (see paragraph 322). The next stage
is labelled &quot;<I>Site Characterization</I>&quot;(see paragraph 303 of
GOV/507) rather than Site Identification. Its result is &quot;<I>identification
of one or more preferred sites for further study</I>&quot;(see paragraph 325)<I></I>in
the Site Confirmation Stage through which &quot;<I>a decision on site
suitability is made</I>&quot;(see paragraph 332)</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RCFProgramme"></A>9. THE RCF WITHIN THE FORWARD PROGRAMME</B></P>
<P>9.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence, I cover the way in which
information from the RCF programme will inform discussions with the regulatory
authorities and the Company's decision whether to propose development of a DWR
at Sellafield. I also discuss the RCF programme in the context of the total cost
and duration of the provisional programme for bringing a DWR into operation at
Sellafield.
</P>
<P><B>Information Required for Decision to Propose Development of a DWR
</B></P>
<P>9.2 Paragraph 8.5 of <I>the HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] refers
to the Inspectorates providing &quot;<I>an informed input to the planning
process</I>&quot; in the context of consideration of a proposed disposal
facility &quot;<I>under the town and country planning legislation</I>&quot;.
Paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 of GOV/307 state, in respect of a major radioactive waste
disposal facility: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In determining a planning application, the planning authority may
consult the Inspectorates on possible environmental impacts of the development.
The Inspectorates will also comment on whether or not there appears to be any
impediment, in the light of the information available to them at the time of
being consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the
categories and quantities intended. Similarly, the HSE would be consulted on
whether there appears to be any impediment to granting a site licence.&quot;</I>
(paragraph 4.3)
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>&quot;Notwithstanding any provisional views given by the Inspectorates
at the planning stage, the authorisations under RSA93 and licensing by the HSE
under the NI Act 1965 will remain legally separate from decisions under the town
and country planning legislation. Decisions on whether to grant an authorisation
or a licence might not be taken until later stages.</I>&quot; (paragraph 4.4).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.3 <I>The HMIP Consultation Document</I> [GOV/307] set out for
consultation a staged application approach as a possible means of facilitating
the timely resolution of an application for authorisation of a major radioactive
waste disposal facility. In its October 1994 response to <I>the HMIP
Consultation Document</I> Nirex stated in paragraph 5 of the Executive Summary
(reproduced in NRX/12/4) that such an option:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>would be welcome in managing the commercial and strategic
risk associated with such a project, and Nirex has for some time envisaged the
provision of safety assessment information to the Inspectorates on a progressive
basis related to the lengthy schedule for repository development</I>.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.4 <I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] states in paragraph 62 that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>For major projects, it is expected that developers will make early
applications for disposal authorisations. This would be at about the same time
that they seek full planning permission for the project, although it would be
determined separately. The regulators would then be able to decide on
authorisations before major commitments of money and effort had been made. If
the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted containing
conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval to start
operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned. ... The
procedure will be available under existing legislation for any applicants who
choose this route. They will not be required to do so, but the greater certainty
it could provide will give applicants an incentive to apply early in the process
in appropriate cases. Further guidance will be given in the revised and updated
version of </I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to the administration of
the Act<I>.</I>&quot; </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>9.5 Pending evaluation of a final version of HMIPs guidance document and of
a revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive Substances Act 1960, a guide to
the administration of the Act</I>, the Companys working assumption as described
in Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph <A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">6.21</A>
of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) is that it will be appropriate to make an application for
authorisation under RSA93 at about the same time as an application for planning
permission to develop the repository. The time at which it is decided whether to
make those applications will constitute the first key decision point in
development of a repository. A decision by the regulatory authorities whether to
approve the start of waste disposal operations, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, would be a subsequent key decision point.   
</P>
<P>Dialogue with the Regulatory Authorities
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.6"></A>9.6 Before finally selecting a particular site at
which to propose repository development, at the first decision point, Nirex
needs to engage in a dialogue with the regulatory authorities about the
developing post-closure safety assessment of a repository located at that site.
The assessment will comprise results from probabilistic calculations and
consideration of a specific repository option against the Inspectorates'
principles and requirements. Through such a dialogue, it will be possible to
take a progressively firmer view about whether, in the light of the assessment,
the regulatory authorities are likely to see any impediment to the eventual
authorisation of a repository for waste disposal and grant of a site licence.
</P>
<P>9.7 By agreement, between 1991 and 1994, Nirex and the authorising
Departments exchanged information and views on Nirex's developing approach to
the evaluation of the Sellafield site. Discussions are in progress about a new
agreement, providing for a more structured approach to dialogue between Nirex
and the regulatory authorities prior to submission of any application for
authorisation of a specific repository option at Sellafield under RSA93. The
principles would be similar to the arrangements envisaged at paragraph 4.1 of
GOV/307 under which the developer of a repository would agree with the
regulatory authorities in advance a programme for the progressive supply of
information once an application is submitted for authorisation of waste
disposal. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.8"></A>9.8 Dr Mellors evidence describes the three phases of
work in the RCF programme, illustrated in
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16fig.htm#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>.
The Phase 1 work provides for shaft sinking which, as Dr Holmes describes in his
evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of
<B>PE/NRX/13</B>), has been identified as playing a major part in the process
of model validation. Dr Mellor explains (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#Para5.9">5.9</A> of <B>PE/NRX/16</B>) that results
from Phase 1 will be released as they are obtained from each sector of the
shaft-sinking programme. They will be an important input to the dialogue with
the regulators which I have described.    
</P>
<P><U>Requirements for the First Decision Point</U></P>
<P>9.9 Any choice of Sellafield as the site for repository development could
not responsibly be made unless Nirex's intention were to develop the repository
on grant of permission. The current target cost for constructing the repository
is &#163;805 million at 1995 prices (see <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>).
Additionally, depending when planning permission were granted, there could be
tens of &#163;millions of expenditure on continuing studies in the RCF (see
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>) to provide information needed for the key
decision point at which the regulatory authorities decide whether to approve the
start of waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>9.10 Given the scale of the financial commitment which would follow, any
decision to propose development of a repository will obviously require a more
confident assessment of post-closure safety than did the 1992 decision to
continue the site investigation programme through the RCF. Through dialogue with
the regulators - informed by review of information which will come from the
continuing surface-based investigations and from the RCF programme - the Company
will be able to reach a view at any point as to how far the regulatory
principles and requirements for a repository are in its view effectively met or,
alternatively, how confident it is of satisfying them at the culmination of the
authorisation process.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.11"></A>9.11 Dr Holmes evidence (paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.23">6.23</A> of <B>PE/NRX/13</B>) explains
the position which the Company needs to have reached in respect of the key
matters before it could decide to propose development of a repository. Those
matters are confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution;
establishing that changes in the geological and hydrogeological setting,
following repository construction or naturally induced changes, would not result
in new pathways for water flow which would significantly impair repository
performance; and reaching provisional decisions on, and establishing a basis for
future optimisation of, key design parameters for a repository. Without
assurance of that kind in these three areas, the Company could not satisfy
itself that a repository at a particular site would meet regulatory requirements
and principles for operational and post-closure safety and that it could be
constructed safely and at acceptable cost. Paragraph 7.8 of this Proof of
Evidence explained that those are the key matters bearing on a decision to
propose repository development.
</P>
<P>9.12 As I described at paragraph 9.2 above, <I>the HMIP Consultation
Document</I> [GOV/307] states that, in the context of the determination of a
planning application to develop a DWR, the regulatory authorities will comment
to the planning authority whether there appears to be any impediment, in the
light of the information available to them at the time of being consulted, to
eventual authorisation of waste disposal and the grant of a site licence. The
Company will keep under continuing review how far the results from its
investigations at Sellafield meet the requirements that I have described above
and whether its dialogue with the regulatory authorities had established that
those authorities would see no such impediment. Unless and until it were
confident that the regulatory authorities would foresee no such impediment, the
Company would not propose development of a repository. Recognising the nature of
the repository system, Government policy stresses that risk calculations can
only <B>inform </B>a judgment about the safety of a disposal facility. It
points out that &quot;<I>other technical factors, including ones of a more
qualitative nature, will also need to be considered</I>...&quot; (paragraph 78
of GOV/208). So it is necessary for the Company to adopt a contingent approach
to deciding whether and when to propose development of a repository, taking
account of the progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P><B>Timing 
</B></P>
<P>9.13 As described in Section 5 of this Proof of Evidence, the Governments
1994-1995 Radioactive Waste Management Policy Review concluded that Nirex should
work towards developing the DWR without any unnecessary delay and that, once a
suitable site has been found, it should be constructed as soon as reasonably
practicable. Specifically, as noted in paragraph 5.21 of this Proof of Evidence,
<I>the Nuclear Review White Paper</I> stated in paragraph 10.39: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The review has concluded that the common interest is in working
towards developing the repository without unnecessary delay, but allowing
appropriate time for the establishment of a sound safety case and compliance
with the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <I>Department of the Environment News Release</I> of 9 May 1995
[GOV/213] stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>On underground waste disposal of ILW, the Review has confirmed the
Government's previous policy that Nirex should proceed without any unnecessary
delay, subject to meeting the necessary planning and regulatory requirements.
However, the Government recognises that time will be needed to establish a sound
safety case and no precise deadline should be set for this process.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The July 1995 White Paper</I> [GOV/208] stated in paragraph 101:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The precise timetable will depend on the granting of planning
consent and compliance with regulatory requirements, including the establishment
of a sound safety case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, at paragraph 44 of GOV/208 the Government referred to &quot;<I>its
policies in relation to the timely disposal of waste</I>&quot;.
</P>
<P><U>Conditional Targets</U></P>
<P>9.14 As foreshadowed in 1994 in <I>the Waste Consultation Document</I>
[GOV/306] the Government policy statements given above overtake the provisions
of <I>the 1990 White Paper </I>[GOV/204] which referred to &quot;<I>speed up</I>&quot;
of Nirexs site investigations and to a proposal for development of a repository
coming &quot;<I>to a public inquiry as soon as possible</I>&quot; (paragraph
15.38 of GOV/204). As it made clear in &quot;<I>UK Nirex Report 710. United
Kingdom Nirex Limited Response to Department of Environment Consultation on
Radioactive Waste Management Policy - 14 October 1994</I>&quot; [&quot;<I>the
Nirex Response to the DoE Consultation</I>&quot;] [NRX/12/3] the Company
welcomes that change of emphasis, given the underlying requirements of careful
scientific characterisation of a repository site. Nirex believes the change
should also be helpful to public confidence (see paragraph 6.6.9 of NRX/12/3). 
</P>
<P>9.15 As I have described in paragraph 5.23 above, <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I> [GOV/208] recognised that additional costs incurred in radioactive
waste disposal should be set against the benefits arising from improvements in
safety achieved. The &quot;<I>level of safety, and the resources required to
achieve it, should not be inconsistent with those accepted in other spheres of
human activity</I>&quot; (paragraph 51). The Companys approach is consistent
with that Government policy. As noted in paragraphs 6.6.10 to 6.7.2 of NRX/12/3,
on behalf of its customers Nirex must work to provide a deep repository
cost-effectively. An important requirement is to ensure that, subject to the
thorough approach to the scientific issues which is necessary to demonstrate
that regulatory requirements are met, and to the need to sustain public
acceptance, the repository be brought into operation without unnecessary delay.
As with any major capital programme - and in economic terms the major sums
invested in conceptual studies and site characterisation are akin to capital
spending - effective control of costs requires the avoidance of avoidable delays
during the development and construction stages.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.16"></A>9.16 One cost of unnecessary delay is the extra
interest which would accrue on the Companys financing. For the year to 31 March
1996, interest accruing on Shareholder loans under the Shareholders' Agreement
is projected at &#163;33 million. The annual interest charge will tend to rise
as the Companys borrowings increase through time. In addition, if the overall
duration of the Companys programme to first emplacement of waste in a repository
is extended, there would be substantial extra outlays involved in keeping
certain contractor teams and Company teams in place over a longer period. Under
both these headings, any delays in proceeding with Phases 2 and 3 of the RCF of
the kind discussed by Dr Holmes in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.30">6.30</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
would bring substantial additional costs.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.17"></A>9.17 Because the project schedule itself is an
important influence on total costs and tariff levels to customers, and because
it is necessary to give a clear focus to the work of the scientific and
engineering teams engaged on the DWR programme, it is appropriate for Nirex as
the developer to work towards a target date for repository operation. For the
future, as in the past, it is recognised that the target will, appropriately, be
kept under review in the light of developments.    
</P>
<P><U>Views of the RWMAC</U></P>
<P>9.18 In October 1994, in <I>the</I> <I>RWMAC Response on: the Department
of Environment's Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I> [GOV/413],
the RWMAC stated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot; ... <I>Nirex's site investigation programme, the development of the
repository safety case and the appropriate authorisation and planning procedures
must all be carried out rigorously. There are obviously some programme issues
that are not in Nirex's control and it may be inappropriate to set fixed
deadlines for the operation of the repository.</I>&quot; (paragraph 58)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>... <I>Clear focusing and targeting are essential to carry forward the
complex repository project. ... </I>&quot; (paragraph 59.)</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These views are very much in line with the Companys approach to
target-setting within the Government's policy that appropriate time be allowed
for establishment of a sound safety case and compliance with the necessary
planning and regulatory requirements and that no precise deadline should be set
for that process. 
</P>
<P><U>Timing of a Decision to Propose Repository Development</U></P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.19"></A>9.19 The Company has long emphasised that its
forward site investigation programme, undertaken in the RCF and otherwise, can
only be planned on a flexible and provisional basis. <I>Nirex Report 327 </I>[COR/504]
explained this in the context of results expected to flow progressively from the
RCF programme. Specifically, paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504 stated that if,
but only if, the results expected to be gathered during the RCF shaft sinking &quot;<I>prove
to be essentially confirmatory of geological and hydrogeological assessments
derived from surface-based investigations</I>&quot; (paragraph 1.13 of COR/504)
then a planning application for a repository could be submitted within six
months or so of excavating down to the most promising horizon for repository
development. It was emphasised that &quot;<I>more extended underground work
might be required before a judgment is possible about such an application</I>&quot;
(paragraph 1.13 COR/504).
</P>
<P>9.20 As Dr Holmes makes clear in paragraph
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.26">6.26</A> of his evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>
Nirex continues to assume that a decision to propose repository development
could be made on the basis of the results from the scientific programme
associated with Phase 1 of the RCF, which now runs for approximately four years
and is planned to finish approximately 9 months after completion of the shafts.
As I have explained in paragraph 9.8 above, those results will be released
progressively, sector by sector, to the regulatory authorities. They will also
be published. However, consistently with paragraphs 1.12 and 1.13 of COR/504, Dr
Holmes also explains that further investigations, in RCF Phase 2, and possibly
Phase 3, could be necessary before a decision is made on repository development.
</P>
<P><U>Current Planning Timetable</U></P>
<P>9.21 In addition to scheduling adjustments necessitated by flexible
responses to information emerging from the characterisation of a natural rock
environment, outcomes from the process of obtaining planning permissions for
necessary investigatory developments can affect the Companys planning.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.22"></A>9.22 The Companys present planning assumption is
that if planning permission for the RCF were granted by the Secretary of State
in mid-1996 and if the Phase 1 results provide an adequate basis for deciding to
make a planning application to develop a repository at Sellafield then first
waste emplacement in a repository will be possible in the first half of 2011.
Nirex will not be declaring a new target date for first waste emplacement - be
it 2011 or some other date - until the Secretary of States decision on the
current appeal is known.
</P>
<P>9.23 Within that overall planning schedule, it is assumed that sinking of
the South Shaft would begin in December 1996 and the Phase 1 Science Programme
would be completed in February 2001. It is expected that the scientific
programme associated with Phase 1 could enable the Company to decide at that
point whether to propose repository development. The first decision point could
on that basis be timed for February 2001 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>9.24 The progress of discussions with the regulatory authorities would be a
crucial consideration in the decision. It is envisaged that an assessment of
post-closure safety would have been submitted to the regulatory authorities
ahead of the earliest date for the first decision point, to provide a basis for
review of key input assumptions. Confidence in the assumptions and judgments
made on the hydrogeological system would be provided by the RCF results as they
were progressively released through Phase1.
</P>
<P>9.25 Assuming that planning permission for a DWR could be granted 3 years
after submission of the planning application and allowing approximately 7 years
for repository construction points to the planning date of first half 2011 for
first emplacement of waste in a repository at Sellafield. Given the many issues
outside Nirex control, that date is indicative. If it were achieved then 22
years would have elapsed since detailed investigations began at Sellafield in
1989. Within that period, 15 years would have been devoted to activities
preceding the grant of planning permission for repository development. This is
not out of line with indicative programmes for deep disposal which have been
announced by various countries overseas, as described in
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A> of Dr Holmes' evidence <B>(PE/NRX/13)</B>.
</P>
<P><U>Summary</U></P>
<P>9.26 The RCF programme sits within a planning schedule for contingent
development of a DWR at Sellafield which will continue to be managed flexibly,
according to the needs of safety assessment and taking account of the other
factors I have described. Results from Phase 1 will inform dialogue with the
regulatory authorities and the Company would not propose development of a
repository until it were confident that those authorities would see no
impediment, in the light of information available to them, to authorisation and
licensing of the facility.
</P>
<P><B>Projected Expenditure on the RCF and DWR Development
</B></P>
<P>9.27 Total outlays on the deep disposal programme up to 31 March 1995 and
targeted through to 2011, in respect of a DWR assumed to be built at Sellafield,
are shown in <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A> and illustrated year by year in
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>. The projections are consistent with the
planning dates for successive stages of the programme given in paragraphs 9.21
to 9.25 above. They exclude interest and contingencies. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.28"></A>9.28 Up to 31 March 1995, Nirex outlays in pursuit
of deep disposal totalled &#163;391 million at 1995 prices. Within that total,
expenditure on the Science Programme which was specific to Sellafield amounted
to approximately &#163;252 million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P>9.29 At the present stage of the repository programme, a key focus for
management control purposes is on development and construction outlays for
bringing a Sellafield repository into operation. Current projections are for a
total outlay of &#163;1884 million at 1995 prices to bring a repository into
operation there .
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.30"></A>9.30 From 1 April 1995 the projected outlays for the
RCF programme are &#163;195 million at 1995 prices, being &#163;124 million for
construction and &#163;71 million for directly associated scientific work. This
represents 10.4% of the total projected outlays leading to a DWR at Sellafield
and 13.1% of the projected outlays to be incurred from 1 April 1995. As can be
seen from <A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A>, even at its projected peak in
2000-01, the RCF outlay will be less than half total Company expenditure in any
year. Annual Company expenditures in real terms, on Sellafield site
investigations and in total, peaked in 1993-94. Company outlays, on the
investigations and in total, will not exceed the historical peak levels until
well into the next century.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.31"></A>9.31 The maximum projected annual expenditure on the
RCF, including directly associated scientific studies, is &#163;23.6 million at
1995 prices, arising in 2000-01. Contracts for the construction of the RCF and
the undertaking of the scientific work directly connected with it have not been
negotiated. But the Company's intention is to limit its financial commitment
through termination provisions, which will ensure the right to terminate at any
time. Given the projected pattern of expenditure, costs associated with early
termination are unlikely to exceed &#163;10 million at 1995 prices. Site
restoration is costed at up to &#163;3 million. So on that basis the maximum
forward commitment to the RCF project, at any time, would be approximately &#163;13
million at 1995 prices. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para9.32"></A>9.32 Any serious scientific investigation of a
preferred site demands the commitment of significant resources, so that the high
standards demanded by Government policy on safety can be demonstrated to be met.
In the Sellafield context, it is clear from <A HREF="#Table9.1">Table 9.1</A>,
<A HREF="#Figure9.1">Figure 9.1</A> and the discussion above that the
expenditure involved in RCF construction and associated scientific work
represents a small proportion of the projected costs for the contingent deep
repository programme. It is neither a &quot;<I>significant pre-commitment to
eventual repository development in economic terms</I>&quot; nor &quot;<I>a
'halfway' commitment to development of a repository at Sellafield</I>&quot; as
suggested in Cumbria County Council's Fifth reason for refusal of the RCF
application.
