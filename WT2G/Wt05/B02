BADEN</P><P>           DEFENDERS of Wildlife is a national environmental group devoted to the protection of wildlife and the restoration of habitat. For years, Defenders strongly advocated the regulatory approach to species protection. But they now realize the limitations of regulations, particularly when dealing with private landowners. This October, they published a collection of essays titled &quot;Building Economic Incentives into the Endangered Species Act.&quot; The collection features incentive-based approaches to species preservation.</P><P>       Dayton Hyde has also learned the importance of incentives - negative incentives. Hyde is a rancher, conservation writer, and the founder of Operation Stronghold, a private wildlife-conservation group. He created a lake and new wildlife habitat on his ranch, attracting a variety of species including bald eagles. For his efforts, state and federal agencies increasingly regulated his operation.</P><P>     For a time, the Forest Service actually restricted him from entering his property by truck, claiming he might disturb the eagles.</P><P>     Dayton Hyde's experience is all too common. Under the current Endangered Species Act, as well as other laws, landowners frequently improve or protect habitat, then face land-use restrictions imposed by government agencies (commonly the EPA or Fish and Wildlife Service). These restrictions often have perverse ecological and ethical consequences.</P><P>     First, they often impede efforts to protect threatened species and critical habitats. Second, they constitute uncompensated &quot;takings,&quot; a form of political plunder.</P><P>     The Endangered Species Act has failed to encourage species and habitat protection because it employs the wrong kind of incentives. Landowners with threatened species on their property may face restrictions that diminish the value of the property and reduce their income from ranching, farming and similar activities. The Act's negative incentives do not enlist the talents and resources of private landowners. Instead, they often discourage cooperation and innovation.</P><P>     The Fifth Amendment was designed to protect citizens from government takings. Its framers understood the harm caused by negative incentives. But today their wisdom is ignored. Landowners know that designated species are likely to impose significant financial costs and restrict their use of the land. Anticipating restrictions, they may accelerate the destruction of habitat.</P><P>     Norman Hutson Jr., of Fort Lewis, Wash., reluctantly clear-cut his tree farm in anticipation of restrictions to protect the spotted owl. Other landowners may covertly disobey regulations or eliminate species and habitat to preclude losses.</P><P>     In the United States, 50 percent of endangered species dwell almost exclusively on private lands. Given the Endangered Species Act's dismal record on private lands, a new approach is needed. With the Act facing renewal in 1994, there is a tremendous opportunity to erect positive incentives with the creation of Biodiversity Trust Funds.</P><P>     The trust funds would purchase conservation easements, much as the North American Elk Foundation, Trout Unlimited, and Ducks Unlimited have done. The trust funds would pay landowners to pursue conservation on their property and could copy Defenders of Wildlife's policy of paying landowners a bounty when an endangered species breeds on their land. Another possibility, noted by Vice President Jim Kraft of Plum Creek Timber and professor Bruce Lippke of the University of Washington, is to use long-term federal bonds to accelerate purchase and retirement of critical habitats.</P><P>     The forces that control land use are largely economic. With this in mind, trust funds have a significant advantage over the current reliance on legal penalties. By buying land and easements or paying bounties, trust funds create positive financial rewards for saving species and habitats. At the very least, landowners who already favor environmental improvements on their land (and many do) are no longer punished for their efforts. The Dayton Hyde dilemma is avoided.  Landowners who are good stewards are rewarded or compensated for creating wetlands, preserving old-growth trees, or encouraging wolves to breed on their lands.</P><P>     In the environmental area as elsewhere, rewards work much better than penalties. They foster innovation and entrepreneurship in environmental protection. With rewards, ranchers might reserve some lands from grazing to improve wildlife habitat, then charge recreationalists and hunters user fees. Commercial forest owners could lengthen rotation times of harvest and selectively log their older trees. Whatever specific approach is taken, owners would have financial incentives to nurture environmental health. Rewards also make compliance and progress easy to monitor because landowners advertise their environmental improvements.</P><P>     Penalties, like fines or imprisonment, are often less effective. They make monitoring difficult because they encourage landowners to covertly evade the law, accelerating logging or eliminating species before costly regulations are enacted or enforced. Penalties also encourage some landowners to abandon commercial or recreational projects, even if these projects could have been undertaken in environmentally sound ways. Private caution becomes society's loss.</P><P>     Incentives are a major factor in shaping individual behavior. Reform of the Endangered Species Act offers an important opportunity to encourage species and habitat protection, not discourage it. By linking personal gain with environmental health and by using cooperation rather than fines, imprisonment, and &quot;takings,&quot; a reformed Environmental Species Act can harmonize ecology, individual creativity and initiative, and prosperity.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           First of a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  IN the fifth grade I started a conservation club for my school. To me, the U.S. Forest Service epitomized conservation and stewardship. Rangers maintained trails, practiced ecology, and found lost hikers while Smokey the Bear admonished us to put out our campfires and appreciate the outdoors.</P><P>     But today we hear that behind the popular symbols is an agency that suffers predictable bureaucratic and political pathologies. We learn that the Forest Service, once a symbol of good government, actually fosters waste and environmental destruction.</P><P>     The Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1905. He initially promised that after a &quot;modest&quot; investment by Congress, the forests would pay for themselves. That has never been true because Forest Service decisions have always been biased by political pressures and budgeting. The deceptions have multiplied to the point that a group of disgruntled employees have set up a watchdog group, the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics (AFSEEE). Its members critique and seek reform of Forest Service policies.</P><P>     The thrust of their, criticism, and that of others, is this: 109 of 122 of the National Forests lose money on their timber sale programs. In doing so they sacrifice the environment and non-timber values of the land. Alaska's Tongass National Forest exemplifies these problems.</P><P>     The Tongass is the largest National Forest, encompassing 16.9 million, acres. It is best known for its temperate old-growth rain forest. This ecosystem has a diverse understory of plants and brush, which provides habitat for bears, owls and wolves, as well as a variety of landmarks including Admiralty Island National Monument.</P><P>     Through massive subsidies, the Tongass is a large supplier of pulp wood and saw timber. While stumpage in the Northwest sells for hundreds of dollars per thousand board feet, in the Tongass it brings under $10 per thousand. Yet the costs of simply administering the timber sales and building the roads is about $56 per thousand. Absent the subsidy, private companies could not harvest such timber. But with the Forest Service footing the bulk of the bill, they do.</P><P>     In the 1950s the Forest Service signed two 50-year contracts to provide logs from the Tongass for two local mills. These contracts oblige the Forest Service to provide highly subsidized timber, up to 300 million board/feet per year, solely to keep the two mills in business. This is regardless of cost, market conditions or the ability of the Tongass to regenerate the timber. So far, over eight billion board feet of timber has been cut and sold for a loss.</P><P>     Under the contracts, the mills are also able to request &quot;emergency rate redeterminations&quot; of contract prices if the market price of milled lumber is inadequate to ensure  profitability. Thus, the mills are assured of a profit. The Tongass returned over $15 million dollars to the mills in 1991 as a refund for &quot;overpayment&quot; in previous years.</P><P>     And, of course, as environmentalists point out, the Forest Service ignores many of logging's cost. Habitat destroyed. Streams and spawning beds silted up by runoff. Sublime forests clearcut. This harms both wildlife and local economies. Healing may take decades.</P><P>     Recently, the Forest Service asked some of its biologists to report on such impacts in the Tongass. The biologists concluded that numerous species would be displaced unless logging were scaled back. But the biologists' supervisors saw a threat to budgets dependent upon timber harvests. They suppressed the report. This is the bureaucratic logic of the former Soviet Union - and the resultant problems are similar.</P><P>     The well-intentioned people of AFSEEE have not been able to change the Forest Service. I have known many people, including some of my best students, who have gone on to work for the Forest Service. Yet little changes. Why do basically good people do bad things?</P><P>       The answer is that with bad incentives, good intentions will not suffice. And the &quot;Forest Soviet's&quot; bureaucratic imperatives continually filter out threatening information. Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It, describes these responses in his last book, Young Men and Fire, telling of Forest Service cover-ups and obfuscation in the deaths of 12 Smokejumpers in a 1949 forest fire.</P><P>     This same process inhibits evolutionary responses to our increasing knowledge of forest ecology and America's changing tastes and values. To prevent such episodes, fundamental reform is required. Personnel changes are not enough. Newcomers will face the same political pressures and antiquated structures. The goals of ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency have yet to be achieved by government bureaucracy.</P><P>     Without proper incentives, reform will fail. There is hope. It lies with alternatives based upon new ways to use property rights and market incentives. With them, we can harmonize economical timber production with environmental goals.</P><P>_______________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>1995 will be the silver anniversary of Earth Day. This will be a significant event, for it marks a full generation since we formally recognized our environment's fragility and value. To celebrate the anniversary, I suggest that we begin a campaign to buy Siberia. This would be America's Earth Day present to the world. Buying Siberia was suggested by Walter Mead, a researcher who has traveled in the region and noted the vast scale of environmental destruction caused by insensitive development of natural resources.</P><P>       Earth Day celebrations usually blend pantheism and pontification. There is much blame-fixing, but little careful analysis of the causes of environmental problems. On Earth Day, many greens are carried away by their enthusiasm and identify corporate greed and individualism as our problems. If everyone could purge greed from their hearts, become informed, and commune with earth spirits, all might be well.</P><P>     My approach is quite different. I focus on the critical shortage - lack of good institutional arrangements. If we buy Siberia we can replace its existing institutions, legacies of socialism and corruption, with institutions that harmonize environmental responsibility and economic progress. Like Yellowstone Park, the world's first national park, this can be America's environmental gift to the world.</P><P>     Just as the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, so we could buy Siberia in 1995. We know enough to avoid past mistakes. After the U.S. bought Alaska it made the mistakes common throughout the American West; it gave government bureaucracies and perverse laws control over the land. The results are clear. The Forest Service, Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, and the Mining Law of 1872 fostered abuse of the West's land, water and wildlife.</P><P>     Today, the Forest Service subsidizes destructive logging in the Rocky Mountain states, Park Service mismanagement turns Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks into overgrazed, simplified ecosystems, the Bureau of Reclamation supports dams that lose money and destroy salmon runs, and the Mining Law of 1872 continues the primacy of mining over other values.</P><P>     Siberia resembles the American West of a century ago - a sparsely inhabited, resource-rich frontier. Siberia's 3.5 million-plus square miles are home to fewer than 15 million people and contain enormous reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds and timber. Siberia also houses environmental treasures such as Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world and an ancient ecosystem; diverse taiga forests of cedar, fir, pine and spruce; endangered species like the Siberian tiger, and dozens of free-flowing rivers.</P><P>     Like the American West of the 1800s, Siberia's environment is threatened by reckless economic development. Lake Baikal and the Angara River are dying from pollution, soil erosion is destroying agricultural land, air pollution is poisoning the people, and toxic mining wastes are simply dumped.</P><P>     Russia lacks the technology, expertise and will to protect environmental values. Poverty and hardship encourage extensive logging, mining and drilling with little thought for the long-term consequences. With many resources located in fragile environments, irresponsible development would be disastrous.</P><P>     Recognizing the threat, some environmentalists advocate creating a huge Siberian wilderness area, off-limits to development. Such proposals reflect self-delusion and intellectual naivete. Surging world demand for natural resources and Russians' desire for development make resource development inevitable. The only questions are: at what environmental costs and for whose benefit?</P><P>       Since we could not halt development even if we wanted to, sincere environmentalists have to foster institutions that will ensure ecologically friendly development. Federal management has failed miserably on the public lands of the United States. Responsible management by the nonprofit and for-profit sectors provides the path to responsible greenness. This requires institutions that provide incentives to consider ecology and community as well as economic values.</P><P>     I recommend we create a public, quasi-governmental corporation to purchase Siberia from Russia. The federal government could legitimize the enterprise and perhaps guarantee the bonds used to raise the cash. After an ecological inventory, the corporation would sell some land (with environmental easements and covenants) to companies and private individuals. The rest would be held as a public resource by environmental trusts modeled after the Nature Conservancy, but not managed by politicians or government bureaucrats.</P><P>     Development would be limited in environmentally sensitive areas. There would be no subsidies for economic development or extractive activities. For example, mining rights would not be subsidized as they currently are in the United States by the Mining Law of 1872. Restoration bonds would hold polluters responsible for any environmental damage they cause. This is necessary to constrain industrial emissions and dumps. Development could be prohibited in irreplaceable environmental areas, places like Lake Baikal, an ecological analog to Yellowstone Park.</P><P>     At the same time, environmentally sensitive development efforts would be encouraged, with the developers liable for any damages they cause. This requires clear and enforceable property rights. Finally, land use would be taxed at rates reflecting its actual use, rather than its most financially valuable potential use. This would eliminate the pressures to develop land in order to meet tax obligations.</P><P>     By creating legally enforceable incentives for nongovernmental landowners to responsibly develop Siberian resources we create a situation in which many good things go together: economic progress for local populations, resources for the world, but most important, development with environmental sensitivity. This example could be an Earth Day present for the world.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           Second in a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  BROCK Evans, vice president and chief lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, recently spoke at a University of Washington Environmental Management Seminar. In response to a question about reforming the Forest Service, he cataloged many destructive, wasteful and insensitive practices. Below-cost timber sales were high on his list of government boondoggles. We agree on these failings.</P><P>     His cure was familiar too: replace the &quot;bad&quot; people in the Forest Service with new, &quot;good&quot; people; and instill the Forest Service with a new corporate culture that respects environmental values, placing them ahead of logging and exploitation. Here our opinions diverge.</P><P>     I believe there are few bad people in the Forest Service, certainly no more than in any large government organization. What dooms the Forest Service are its bad budgetary incentives.</P><P>     As Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, put it, &quot;It's the budget that energizes the Forest Service.&quot; And the Forest Services' budgeting process is fundamentally perverse. It provides incentives to generate below-cost timber sales and to discount the value of recreation, wildlife habitat and environmental amenities.</P><P>     In the private sector, business income must cover expenditures. But the Forest Service does not run like that - and it cannot go bankrupt. An obscure 1930 law called the Knutson-Vandenburg Act is important to the budgeting process. Under it, the Forest Service is allowed to keep the revenue from its timber sales while timber sale costs are funded by Congressional appropriation.</P><P>     In 1930 it cost the Forest Service 50 cents per thousand board feet to hold a timber sale. So the Forest Service wrote a rule specifying that 50 cents be returned to the Treasury for every thousand board feet. The 50-cents rule still applies - but today the average sale costs over $50 per thousand board feet.</P><P>     So while the taxpayer pays a timber sale's costs (overhead, planning, road construction, etc.), the Forest Service keeps the bulk of the proceeds. There is virtually no direct connection between income and expense. And if the Forest Service is the budget maximizer its chief suggests, the incentive is to maximize timber sale volume, not net value, and therefore receipts. In this way the Forest Service's budget will rise once when Congress appropriates sale funds and then again when sale receipts are received.</P><P>     As a result, according to forest economist Randal O'Toole, 90 percent of our national forests lose money on their timber-sale programs. This costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</P><P>     There is another reason why so many sales occur: There are 122 National Forests in 40 states. The Treasury is required to pay 25 percent of the proceeds of each timber sale to local communities. Congressmen put political pressure on the Forest Service to hold sales in their districts, seeking to funnel dollars back home. Tellingly, Puerto Rico (with no vote in Congress) has the only national forest without a timber-sale program.</P><P>     Congress often passes Forest Service appropriation bills specifying harvest levels, often above even what the Forest Service recommends. These timber sales are pork barrel projects. Over time this creates communities dependent upon Forest Service welfare. As people developed stakes in this system, meaningful reform became increasingly difficult.</P><P>     We can see why the Forest Service hosts so many below-cost sales. They provide its life blood, money, as well as a pipeline for Congressional pork. Not that all Forest Service personnel are willing accomplices in a grand scheme to defraud the taxpayer. Why are &quot;good&quot; managers so often captured and co-opted by this budgeting process? Below-cost timber sales provide funding to support the Forest Service's other work, like habitat management.</P><P>     But the result is that the taxpayer gets nothing for something, subsidizing clearcuts that are seldom environmentally friendly. Al Gore states in his book Earth in the Balance, &quot;As the world's leading exemplar of free-market economics, the U.S. has a special obligation to discover effective ways of using the power of market forces to help save the environment.&quot; Market approaches to Forest Service problems can illuminate reform. We can recognize the advantages of private sector timber management. It strives for efficiency. Private firms harvest only timber that can pay its way out of the woods. Concurrently, we recognize the need to develop the environmental sensitivity of private firms.</P><P>     If the Forest Service is to salvage its reputation, it must move toward economic responsibility. The elimination of incentives to hold below-cost sales is a good first step. Make the Forest Service fund timber sales only out of net timber sale receipts. No more incentives to lose money, and no incidental environmental harm in the bargain. Only good people and good incentives can fix the Forest Service.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

It initiated an efficient strategy to reduce pollution from powerplants and factories.</P><P>     The theory is straightforward: Government sets an acceptable overall emissions level for a pollutant, in this case the sulfur dioxide emitted by electrical utilities and factories. It then creates tradable permits and gets out of the way to let the market process produce the best way to achieve the reductions.</P><P>     From 1995 onward, industrial plants must have an allowance to emit sulfur dioxide. The government grants pollution allowances to plants based upon their emissions history. For example, those which emitted an average of 100 tons over the past four years were given grandfathered permits for 75 tons in 1995. (The amount drops to 50 tons in the year 2000.) Each grandfathered permit was subtracted from the national emissions limit. The remainder were then auctioned to the highest bidder by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     This system has highly positive environmental and economic implications. First, it encourages utilities to find the most efficient way to comply with the law. They may either buy permits at auction or find money-saving ways to cut emissions. A highly successful plant may be able to cut emissions for less than the going price of an emissions permit. It can then cut pollution further, selling or retiring its extra permits.</P><P>     The result is a market which provides incentives for innovative pollution-control techniques. The emitters with the lowest cost of control will reduce their emissions the most. Those who find ways to emit less save money, just what our environmentally conscious nation increasingly desires.</P><P>     The early results seem promising. Illinois Power Company expects to save at least $250 million over the next 20 years by buying permits as opposed to building a new scrubber. But this is not an increase in pollution. Rather, it is a transfer, for a utility somewhere must now emit less. So Illinois ratepayers save money, the nation moves toward its emissions goals, and the government raises revenues by selling permits.</P><P>     In future years the total number of permits offered, and hence the amount of pollution, will be reduced. Illinois Power will continually reassess its emissions costs and control strategies. It may even build a new scrubber. But the expectation is that, when faced with options and competitive pricing of permits, companies will find innovative, and less expensive, ways to reduce their own emissions. So we all get a cleaner environment at lower cost.</P><P>     And since anybody can bid on permits, the system also enables those who most value clean air to enter the market. At least one environmental group, National Healthy Air Exchange, bids on permits, hoping to buy and &quot;retire&quot; them.</P><P>     Northeast Utilities donated 10,000 tons of its 140,000-ton annual allowance to the American Lung Association. Eastern coal miners may buy some to package with their &quot;dirty,&quot; or high-sulfur, coal, and hence save their jobs.</P><P>     These are just some of the possibilities created by tradable permits. Environmental and business entrepreneurs will surely find more. This process unleashes the innovation and creativity which make markets such successful institutions.</P><P>     This sale also illustrates another advantage of market-based environmental solutions: The sale was not the lead story on the evening news. Market solutions promote adjustment and compromise without political grandstanding and public recriminations.</P><P>     In an honest market, there is no angling for a favorable exemption from clean-air laws, no political payoffs for special treatment. The market solves the social problem of distribution efficiently, at low cost and with minimum fuss.</P><P>     As President Clinton grapples with conflicts over old-growth forests, he should learn from the example offered by the Chicago Board of Trade. Markets can be harnessed to help the environment, perhaps through a national biodiversity trust fund which would buy habitat and development rights to important ecosystems.</P><P>     Our president may be the best political salesman in history. Surely if the Chicago Board of Trade can get people to buy pollution, President Clinton can devise ways to sell the spotted owl's recovery. </P><P>_____________</P><P>John A.

Baden</P><P>Some of the questions raised in this column are addressed in FREE's forthcoming book, &quot;Environmental Gore: A Constructive Response to Earth in the Balance.&quot;</P><P>  THE global warming debate, like many environmental issues, is scientifically complex and highly emotional. Its complexity hinders informed debate and its emotionalism makes consensus elusive. Part of the problem is that climatology (the discipline dealing most directly with global climate issues) is a young and inexact science. But much of the problem can be traced to special interest's manipulation of the political process.</P><P>     Contrary to conventional wisdom, many fundamental questions about global warming remain unanswered. Two crucial questions are: 1) Is significant human-induced global warming actually occurring? 2) If it is occurring, will the net effects be beneficial or harmful? In neither case is the answer an unambiguous &quot;yes.&quot;</P><P>       First, significant global warming may not be occurring. Certainly, the historical relationship between CO and temperature changes is ambiguous. Although levels of atmospheric CO have risen nearly 40 percent since the turn of the century, data from within the United States indicates no statistically significant increase in mean annual temperatures. In fact, between 1920 and 1987, there was a slight cooling trend.</P><P>     Data also indicates that the rise in hemispheric temperature has been significantly less than expected given the increase in CO. And the region most likely to see temperature increases, the Arctic, has actually cooled since about l940.</P><P>     Furthermore, the climate models used to predict warming depend on numerous unknowns. For example, we do not know how changes in cloud cover will affect global temperatures. Although the models agree that a warmer earth is likely to be a cloudier earth, it is unknown whether more clouds will cool the planet by reflecting sunlight or warm the planet by trapping re-radiated heat before it escapes into space. The net effect is unclear. Neither do the models explain the impact of temperature changes on polar ice and snow. A warmer climate may increase precipitation and produce more ice and snow in colder areas. This would increase the earth's albedo and cool the planet.</P><P>     The empirical and theoretical uncertainties surrounding global warming counsel caution before making policy. Scientists are certainly being cautious; a Feb. 13, 1992 Gallup poll shows that most climate scientists doubt there has been any significant human-caused global warming to date.</P><P>     But even if global warming does occur, it is unlikely to be a catastrophe. Robert Balling, director of the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University, and Richard Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at M.I.T., conclude that doubling atmospheric CO is likely to produce an average global temperature increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This, increase is likely to be most significant at night, at high latitudes, and during the winter. It will not melt polar ice caps nor raise sea levels more than a few inches. There will not be super-hurricanes and there will not be endless summers of blazing temperatures.</P><P>     In fact, there are many benefits associated with increased atmospheric CO. Doubling CO levels will favor bigger plants and may increase average crop yields by an estimated 33 percent. More atmospheric CO allows plants to grow using less water by reducing evapotranspiration - water evaporating after it is released from plants' pores. Precipitation and soil moisture may rise, and droughts may become less frequent.</P><P>     Amidst the uncertainties, one thing is certain: Some groups benefit if the public believes global warming is a genuine crisis that can only be stopped with massive political mobilization. Irresponsible efforts by these groups fuel fears of widespread drought and crop failures, of super powerful hurricanes, of oceans engulfing coastal cities, and of blazing summer temperatures. How do they gain by hyping global warming?</P><P>        For environmental groups, global warming is the ultimate issue. It affects everyone, it is dramatic and thus captures the public's attention, and it can only be solved by mobilizing government to impose regulations and develop programs. For those environmentalists hostile toward industrial civilization, global warming provides a rationale to impose their version of ecotopia. The threat of global warming gives license to those who seek to profit from crises.</P><P>     Insurance companies may also gain from government efforts to control global warming. Insurers are motivated more by profits than ideology. If global warming causes increased hurricane damage or floods, they may lose immense amounts of money. Massive carbon taxes or regulation may halt warming and their losses. Since they as taxpayers will pay only a trivial portion of any regulatory bill, it is reasonable for them to seek such measures. If global warming never manifests, they lose little, but society loses a lot.</P><P>     When making decisions and facing uncertainty, responsible people evaluate the most likely costs and benefits of alternative strategies. Given our current understanding, the changes wrought by global warming may well bring small costs or perhaps benefits. Massive prevention programs will surely be expensive, they will slow economic progress worldwide. Moreover, delaying action for a few years, while our understanding of climate change improves, is likely to lead to more prudent policies. If substantial warming is going to occur, a few years delay will make very little difference.</P><P>     The global warming debate is far from settled. In deciding what to do, we should consider both the merits of the arguments and the possibility that they are being manipulated for hidden agendas. If we do not, we are likely to be stampeded into public policies with huge immediate costs and few if any benefits.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE Montana chapter of Defenders of Wildlife has announced a new program to encourage wolf re-introduction. This is noteworthy because it seeks to do so with the help of ranchers, until now some of the wolves' staunchest  opponents. This approach could hold the key to fostering the recovery of  endangered species nationwide and have implications for the Northwest's debate  over the spotted owl.</P><P>  While the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires species preservation, it does little to address the means of such preservation. The Defenders of Wildlife  program pledges to pay $5000 to any landowner in the Northern Rockies who has wild wolves successfully reproduce on their private land.</P><P>     &quot;Our fondest dream is to give away a lot of money,&quot; says Hank Fischer of Defenders of Wildlife. The wolf program will supplement the ESA and its  mandates, utilizing the power of economic incentives, which until now have  worked against the wolf.</P><P>     There are many reasons why the carrot of economic incentives may be more  effective than the stick of the ESA. It turns opponents of preserving specific  species into proponents by offering to pay for their assistance. Hundreds of  individuals will now seek ways to directly improve wolf habitat instead of being indifferent at best, hostile and destructive at worst. Individuals who are being paid to harbor wolves are unlikely to sue over land-use restrictions. And it is a first step toward recognizing the real economic importance of endangered species.</P><P>     While conservationists argue that species are &quot;priceless,&quot; that does not change the reality and incentives facing those who are most directly affected by recovery efforts. The decision to foster species recovery is ecological, but the impacts are economic and political. Those impacts must be addressed before successful recovery can take place.</P><P>     The prime rule of ecology - that everything in an ecosystem is linked - explains why &quot;indicator species&quot; that measure the quality of habitat (such as the spotted owl) are important. A threat to them indicates the system is awry.</P><P>     Such interdependence is also found in political and economic systems. There, too, it is impossible to do only one thing. We take one action and see unintended consequences as the spontaneous order adjusts. Mandates that seem simple from Washington, D.C., have unexpected consequences when implemented in the West.</P><P>     Under the current system, no federal agency has an incentive to consider  economic efficiency. Once a recovery plan is written, the only incentive for  public and private land managers to follow the plan is the threat of a lawsuit, the stick, if they do not. The Defenders of Wildlife have tried to change that by offering the carrot.</P><P>     Since 1987, the Defenders of Wildlife have run a program that compensated ranchers for cattle killed by wolves. It has paid over $12,000 to 10 Montana ranchers who have lost cattle. However, this program, while reducing the risk to ranchers, gave them little incentive to actually facilitate wolf re-introduction. Indeed, many still believe that the associated hassle is not worth the benefits of wolf re-introduction.</P><P>     Ranchers risk losing control of their property when a wolf pack chooses their land as its territory. The long arm of the federal Endangered Species Act could force them to alter long-established land-use practices if they threatened the viability of a resurgent wolf population. An endangered species takes precedence over private property rights. Not only could ranchers lose control over their property, but they risked their cattle as well. Even if they would be compensated for predator loss, was it worth the hassle?</P><P>       This is the central problem of the Endangered Species Act: It imposes the costs of species survival not widely upon those who like the animals, but narrowly upon those who own the habitat. This is the preservationists version of the NIMBY problem: Many people like wolves, but Not In My Barn Yard. Just as few people wish to live next to a waste incinerator, few ranchers with horses and other livestock want the worries of wolf predation.</P><P>     This is where the Defenders of Wildlife has entered. By pledging to pay ranchers who have wolf dens on their lands, they have changed the entire incentive structure. Now if a rancher has habitat that attracts a pack of wolves, he has incentives to encourage their success. Instead of seeking to hide the wolves presence - &quot;shoot, shovel and shut-up&quot; - he would inform scientists and wildlife officials so that he might be compensated. Instead of discouraging continued habitation through various, possibly illegal, means, he might choose to improve habitat to ensure future payments. More could be spent studying growing populations and less spent turning ecologists into law-enforcement officers.</P><P>     No longer will those who have the most reason to oppose wolves be charged  with their upkeep. The costs would be spread among those who most strongly  desire healthy wolf populations. It is likely that this will result in more rapid population expansion, to the benefit of both those who love wolves and those who harbor them.</P><P>     The issue of wolves in Montana can teach us much about our own debates over the spotted owl. The Defenders of Wildlife have shown us how the right incentives can change landowners from victims to supporters of endangered species.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/wolf.gif" WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=263><P>__________________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THE election of Governor Clinton and Senator Gore alerts us to a new environmental movement. They claim to be seeking innovative and efficient ways to achieve environmental goals. For the past 20 years such an alternative approach has been developed. It may at last receive the attention in Washington that it has earned in universities and think tanks.</P><P>       It is called the New Resource Economics (the NRE). It is based upon incentives and voluntary action. It recognizes the role property rights and markets play in coordinating and rationing valuable resources.</P><P>     But other than professional analysts and economists, few people understand the logic or applications. Much of the writing has been scholarly and highly specialized, read only by graduate students under duress. Through this and future columns, I will attempt to bridge this gap between academia and the concerned citizen.</P><P>     Most people in the Northwest are familiar with the battles over timber, spotted owls, and salmon. Traditional lawmaking and regulatory schemes have yet to find productive, mutually acceptable solutions. But there is another way, a win-win approach. It can lead to more environmentally sensitive management. The focus is upon how information and incentives affect decision-makers. There is explicit recognition that differing institutional arrangements generate different incentives and therefore different management decisions.</P><P>     Our natural resources are managed by a variety of legal and economic institutions, including markets, private companies, nonprofit corporations and government. Each has different but predictable benefits and flaws. Markets can only work when we can establish clear and transferable property rights and do so at a low cost. Nonprofits have problems motivating and monitoring their staffs and volunteers. Governmental agencies suffer from bureaucratic inefficiency and often turn into captives of special interests and engines of plunder. When advocating environmental reforms we should recognize that no institutional form is perfect, and consider the information and incentives of each in terms of the goals.</P><P>     This care is required because good intentions are not enough. The forces of self-interest are relentless. Over the long run, if environmental reform is to be successful, our institutions must direct this individual self-interest to environmental quality.</P><P>     Last summer's revelations about political pressures on U.S. Forest Service and Park Service regional leaders are compelling testimonies to the importance of this focus. When our resource and environmental agencies are dependent upon politics, their leaders face incentives to yield to political pressures. When existing incentives remain constant, merely changing agency personnel to those more &quot;committed&quot; will not solve the problem. Only changing the institutions will produce lasting changes.</P><P>     Many of our existing institutions work against environmental stewardship. When decision-makers are insulated from the costs of their actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems follow.</P><P> For example, when individuals are not rewarded for preserving habitat, it is under-produced. When pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced.</P><P>     Take the case of the Forest Service. Because it gets money from logging, not recreation, it is no surprise that it zealously promotes logging and road-building. A way to make the Forest Service more responsive to the public is to collect user fees from hikers, bikers, and campers. In a majority of National Forests, recreation could easily generate more net dollars than timber. And in areas where logging continues to be profitable, forest managers would face incentives to reduce its visual and environmental impact to retain their recreation income. In such ways, institutions can be arranged to make economic progress and environmental quality complementary.</P><P>       Private property and markets can be used to foster these mutually beneficial agreements and accommodations. For example, limited oil drilling allowed on the Rainey Preserve, an Audubon-owned migratory bird sanctuary in Louisiana, is an example of this. Oil companies compete to drill and produce in environmentally sensitive ways and Audubon gets royalties with which they expand sanctuaries. In a few more years the wells will be played out but the sanctuary will remain.</P><P>     Contrast this with oil exploration on government lands. Audubon raises money to fight such development. The NRE enables us to see why: By seeking to protect bird habitat on federal lands, Audubon signals environmental concern and generates income. However, it pays none of the opportunity costs of not exploiting that land.</P><P>     Good institutional arrangements, like Audubon's ownership of Rainey, make decision-makers responsible for both costs and benefits of an action, lessen political confrontation, and foster cooperation. Markets and property rights help weigh trade-offs. Because of political pressures, this is exceedingly difficult in government institutions.</P><P>     No institution is perfect, and a mix is required. But private property rights, incentives, voluntary action and entrepreneurial creativity are under-appreciated tools for the environmentalist. They foster the economic progress that encourages environmental concern and the capacity to act upon that concern. These are the features of this new approach that make it attractive to environmental economists and policy analysts. The question is whether the Clinton/Gore administration will demonstrate the political skills required to deliver the outcomes they claim to seek.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           MANY recreationalists bristle at the prospect of recreation fees on our national forests. Why should we pay to hike on &quot;our&quot; land? They are outraged, however, when they encounter clear-cuts near timberline on these same lands. But if they could choose between recreation fees and timber cutting, might fees then be accepted as the lesser of two evils?</P><P>        The reason for clear-cuts is, as you might expect, money. The Forest Service budget increases with every timber sale. Specifically, with every board-foot that it sells, the Forest Service generates income from Congress and lumber companies. The more it sells, the bigger its budget. Recreation and aesthetic interests, however, return few dollars to the Forest Service budget. How can they compete with timber when decisions are made by budget-maximizing managers?</P><P>       Congress' answer has been the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. It states that Forest Service management should give equal weight to &quot;outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.&quot; In practice, it means that creative Forest Service planners suddenly discover that recreation and environmental benefits are produced by logging. For example, new roads into pristine wilderness areas improve access while clear-cuts provide increased &quot;edge&quot; habitat for forest animals. Congressional multiple-use mandates are thus trumped by budgetary incentives.</P><P>     So multiple use fails because budgetary pressures for logging and grazing need not compete with revenue from recreation. Recreation fees can level the playing field and guarantee that non-timber values are considered. Revenues from biking, hiking, and camping in the national forests can provide monetary incentives for land managers to consider non-timber values. If they do not consider such values, they will sacrifice income. And as timber shows, income speaks.</P><P>     The Forest Service estimates that the market value of national forest recreation is over $5 billion per year. A more modest estimate by forest economist Randal O'Toole, using a recreation fee average of only $3 per day, is $1 billion per year. Even so, O'Toole estimates that such recreation fees would outweigh timber receipts on 80 percent of the national forests. So recreation can compete. With fees, eight of ten national forests, those ill-suited for commercial timber production, would see little timber cutting. And even on the truly productive forests, cutting would likely be more sensitive as managers sought to maintain some recreation income.</P><P>     Fees would come from day permits and annual passes. Enforcement would occur by making permits visible, either on vehicles or a ski-lift type tag. Similar methods work well with fishing licenses, in national forest campgrounds, and in Washington State Sno-Parks.</P><P>     Equity is a concern. But if the poor were asked which free goods and services they would most like, would hiking and camping make the top ten? When considered relative to outdoor equipment and transportation costs, fees fade to insignificance.</P><P>     But the benefits of such fees would be substantial. Timber cutting on our national forests should occur only when timber values exceed those values lost to logging. Fees would help ensure this result. Much less would be cut, and that which was cut would likely be more sensitive to aesthetic and recreation values. We would also have a rational means for evaluating recreation - timber trade-offs.</P><P>     This would also change the incentives faced by private forest managers. When our national forests give away recreation, private managers cannot compete. But when national forests charge fees, private land may open up to recreation, also for a fee. Private landowners, who currently can only profit from timber sales, would have an alternative source of revenue and increased reasons to act with sensitivity toward the land.</P><P>     Such private sector incentives are important because much private land has non-timber value. Recreation fees encourage landowners to recognize such value and preserve their lands. And by reducing the cut from marginal timber sites on our national forests, we will foster more careful management of private commercial forests, most of which are biologically better suited for timber production.</P><P>     Recreation on public lands is similar to timbering or livestock grazing in that each use affects other opportunities. There is a cost measured in other uses foregone. This &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of using the national forests for recreation is often some foregone logging or grazing. Without recreation fees, it is no contest. Logging and grazing revenues win. With fees, logging will face the opportunity costs of lost recreation income.</P><P>     While the Forest Service has a multiple-use mandate, it faces a dominant-use incentive. True multiple use implies multiple incentives. Recreation fees will help to level the playing field and protect our national forests for the uses we most value.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is clear from the argument of protectionists in Congress that many are pessimistic about the future of U.S. manufacturing. But recent events suggest prudent optimism, if not unconstrained joy.</P><P> While not all good things go together, some do. Economic understanding can help us find such unions.</P><P>     Environmental leaders show this improved understanding of economics. They are becoming aware that prosperity and environmental quality are complements, not competitors. The anti-business, anti-market, pro-regulatory rhetoric that marked the environmental movement in the 1970s and '80s is being replaced with an acceptance of markets and an appreciation of the advantages of decentralized decision-making.</P><P>       Only a few years ago, many environmental leaders held up the centralized and socialized economies of Eastern Europe as environmentally superior to the market economies of the West. After all, some had constitutional guarantees of environmental quality.</P><P>     But after the revolutions of 1989, the truth seeped out. Chernobyl was only the most graphic example. Even the most committed collectivists had to admit that the systems they championed were economically inefficient, environmentally destructive and thoroughly corrupting.</P><P>     Further, there is increased understanding that only with international trade can nations and regions realize their comparative advantages and increase prosperity through efficiency. This is especially true of poor nations: They have the most to gain from free-trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is such a step toward Mexican prosperity. The argument that NAFTA will harm Mexico's environment discounts an important fact. That is, as poor nations become wealthy their health and environmental standards rise. This holds across time and cultures: richer is cleaner, safer and more environmentally sensitive.</P><P>     Looking across the Mexican border, we simply cannot expect Third World nations to have the standards of first world nations. They have different priorities: food, shelter, clothing. We see horrifying examples of environmental health and safety violations. What would be truly extraordinary would be the absence of this difference. In my judgment, if NAFTA is passed, both the Mexican and U.S. economies will become more productive and Mexican environmental standards will rise toward ours. NAFTA will ultimately &quot;level&quot; both the environmental and wage playing fields with Mexico.</P><P>     And most importantly, American manufacturers are moving up the learning curve in efficiently dealing with environmental regulations. The Amoco Corporation recently conducted a major research project, cosponsored by EPA, at their Yorktown refinery. It was a thorough effort to investigate the costs and effectiveness of current pollution-control structures.</P><P>     The costs of pollution control are significant. That is why we see battles in Congress every time there is an attempt to raise environmental standards. A green world costs money. Our government should do its best to minimize these costs, but the Yorktown project shows that this is not the case.</P><P>       Yorktown was the first systematic attempt to assess all refinery emissions: air, water, soil - and to put a price tag on their control. Historically, EPA has monitored emissions only from selected points, like smoke stacks and containment pools. The Yorktown project found that these are not necessarily the areas which should be controlled. For example, large emissions came from the loading dock, a place EPA has never before checked.</P><P>     The bottom line: Amoco could achieve greater pollution reduction for about $11 million than it is getting for the $41 million in controls specified by EPA. When pollution control is inexpensive, we want a lot of it. When we must give up a lot to get it, we want less. Environmentalists are learning to favor efficient control because in the end it will mean less pollution.</P><P>     This &quot;second battle of Yorktown&quot; has revolutionary potential. It clearly demonstrates that the regulatory command-and-control approach employed to control industrial pollution is seriously flawed. Political incentives make government management costly and inefficient. Agencies should simply set goals and monitor results rather than specify process. The Yorktown Project shows that this is likely to save money and result in lower pollution levels - just as economics predicts.</P><P>     Although it would take a replication of the Yorktown work at many sites to obtain good estimates of potential national savings, the findings of Yorktown seem typical of manufacturing in general. In other words, American manufacturing has potential of meeting high environmental standards at a very substantial discount from today's costs.</P><P>       The lesson here is that while much of American industry can do well in the global marketplace, current government regulations are obsolete. If we are truly concerned about international competitiveness and losing jobs to low-cost foreign competitors, we should seek efficiency wherever possible - even in our environmental regulations. Fortunately, it seems we can do this without sacrificing our health and environmental standards. Amoco and EPA have shown us a beginning. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

Twice in August we had snow at 6,500 feet. Our ranch is between Bozeman and Big Sky, Mont. Normal rainfall is just under 20 inches per year.</P><P> This year we had 14.5 inches in July. Hay wouldn't cure and the barley is still in the field. &quot;Where is global warming when we need it?&quot; was a common question, repeated over the summer as a series of visitors joined up in the Big Sky country.</P><P>     Despite this, our annual migration back to FREE's summer office was wonderfully rewarding. We worked hard, played hard and got the mix just right. FREE hosted a week-long seminar in environmental economics for academics and another, co-sponsored by the Environmental Management program at UW's Business School, for federal judges.</P><P>     We held several shorter programs for business leaders and environmental writers. A summer highlight was our annual &quot;seminar on wheels,&quot; a 407-mile bike trip from Yellowstone to Glacier national parks. (Economists call our team the FREE riders.) This was a seven-day exercise in stoic epicurism. We twice ground our way up the Continental Divide, Marias and Flesher passes, but as a result could indulge our appetites with impunity. Ah, the leisure of the theory class.</P><P>     Aside from the writers, few of our guests specialize in environmental matters. Most accepted conventional environmental perspectives and were surprised that I do not. &quot;How can you care about environmental quality and yet reject the `green' view?&quot; was a recurrent question, and &quot;Are you optimistic about Gore?&quot; another. Here are my answers.</P><P>     I believe that our vice president exemplifies the new public policy elite. He is sensitive, especially about the environment, ambitious, and confident of his superior knowledge of the way things really ought to be. When he ran for president in the spring of 1987, he saw global warming as a key campaign issue. His book, &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; deals with this issue. Gore's treatment of global warming illustrates the process and problems of his brand of environmentalism.</P><P>     &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; was on the New York Times bestseller list for 22 weeks. Why is this book so attractive to the new policy elite? And why do they ignore arguments that contradict Gore's apocalyptic assertion? Given the recurrent and predictable failures of bureaucratic, command-and-control environmental management, why do Gore and his followers neglect an environmentalism based upon property rights and the market process? Here's my hypothesis.</P><P>     Gore and the new elite specialize in abstract symbols, not material things. They don't get dirty or do heavy lifting. They don't experience the daily reality checks so familiar to most Americans, especially to people who sign payroll checks. The defining characteristics of Gore's peer group include intelligence and a dedication to politics. They seem confident in their ability to know what is good for other people - and quite willing to employ state coercion to enforce its realization. That is how they get things done.</P><P>     Global warming gives them justification to control other people's lives. From their standpoint, global warming is a special kind of environmental issue, for it has a huge political benefit. It gives policy-makers a &quot;legitimate&quot; reason to constrain our liberty to act - e.g., by denying us safe, private vehicles. They want us to believe that the specter of global warming is so severe, the projected consequences so bad, that radical action is necessary. If global warming is both certain and dire, they can justify regulations to prevent this calamity. This is why Gore and others feel compelled to stifle debate and declare the issue decided. As they portray it, global warming gives rulers license to expand their rule.</P><P>     This summer I worked on FREE's upcoming book with the Pacific Research Institute of San Francisco, &quot;Balancing the Earth's Economy and Ecology.&quot; The contributors are a distinguished lot, and they deal with the philosophic and scientific issues of &quot;Earth in the Balance.&quot; Some argue that severe global warming is unlikely. And even if some global warming occurs, some consequences will surely be beneficial. On balance, we can't tell.</P><P>     But whether the subject is global warming or deforestation, environmental problems are complex and highly emotional. Good data and clear thinking are required to deal with them. As Gore says in &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; &quot;. . . to exclude inconvenient facts from the calculation of what is good and what is bad is a form of dishonesty&quot; (p. 188). Sensitive and sound environmental understanding is too important for truth to be gored by a collectivist ideology and a quest for governmental control.</P><P>     This is a theme of my Winter Quarter course, &quot;Business and the Environment: the Political Economy of Environmental Policy&quot; (BA 590). Although it's a Business School offering, students from all over the university take it, as do a few townspeople.</P><P>     Some of my lectures become columns. I invite you to follow my Wednesday columns. I welcome your suggestions of topics. The quality of our environment is important enough to merit our most careful and honest consideration.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>HARVARD University Press recently published a book on risk regulation written by Stephen Breyer, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit. Breyer argued that &quot;the resources available to combat health risks are not limitless.&quot; He is exactly right. We maximize health and environmental quality by investing our money and efforts where the payoffs are highest.</P><P>       It makes good sense to prioritize environmental protection. Unfortunately, good sense is conspicuously absent in current efforts to ban the use of chlorine. Greenpeace calls for a &quot;chlorine-free society.&quot; Support also comes from other environmental organizations. George Coling of the Sierra Club states &quot;. . . the debate is no longer whether to phase out these chemicals, but how&quot; and Tim Eder, of the National Wildlife Federation notes, &quot;When it comes to (these chemicals) you don't make them, produce them, or dispose of them . . . you just get rid of them!&quot; We should be wary of their claims, for they suggest political opportunism, not sound science.</P><P>     Greenpeace and its allies argue that chlorine and all organochlorines (i.e. compounds containing chlorine) threaten wildlife and people. They see an outright ban as the quickest and most effective way to improve environmental quality. Further, they claim that a &quot;chlorine-free society&quot; is achievable at modest economic cost. None of these claims are accurate.</P><P>     Their first mistake is failing to distinguish among chlorinated compounds. A rigorous toxicology analysis composed by CanTox, a group of consultants in toxicology, health and environmental sciences, convincingly argues that the mere presence of chlorine does not render a compound carcinogenic. Assuming a substance is harmful merely because it contains chlorine is akin to assuming water is flammable simply because it contains hydrogen, a highly flammable element. Different compounds with the same elements often have very different properties.</P><P>     Clearly, certain chlorinated substances, such as PCBs, DDT and dioxin, do harm wildlife at sufficiently high concentrations. However, PCBs and DDT were banned years ago and today dioxin emissions are kept to virtually undetectable levels. The point is this: Regulations should target specific substances whose environmental harm has been clearly demonstrated through rigorous scientific studies. The ad hoc reasoning used by Greenpeace and others is no substitute for careful risk analysis.</P><P>     In addition, it's hard to tell if a chemical &quot;causes harm.&quot; Harm varies with the extent of exposure and disappears entirely below certain threshold doses. In the Great Lakes, bald eagles, double-crested cormorants and other predator bird populations rebounded as DDT and PCBs were phased out and emission regulations reduced dioxin concentrations. Moreover, at the concentrations typically found in our environment, no organochlorines seem to cause identifiable human health problems.</P><P>     Industrial uses aside, it is worth remembering that until chlorination became widespread, dirty water was the most serious public health problem, spreading cholera, typhoid fever and dysentery. Contaminated water supplies still kill 25,000 children a day in the Third World. The substitutes Greenpeace favors are more costly and much less effective at maintaining water purity.</P><P>     Will chlorine substitutes be safer than chlorine? No one can be certain. But, we have an enormous amount of practical experience using and controlling chlorine - experience that does not exist for many substitutes and cannot exist for many innovations. Past experience indicates that new risks will appear once the substitutes are used regularly. Thus, Greenpeace presents us with a false choice - the danger of chlorines or the safety of substitutes. Chlorines are not nearly as dangerous as they portray and substitutes are unlikely to be as safe as they claim.</P><P>     A chlorine ban also implies substantial economic costs. For example, pulp and paper manufacturers often use chlorine to bleach wood pulp to create high quality paper. Switching to chlorine-free processes (i.e. &quot;totally chlorine-free bleaching&quot;), would require extensive reconstruction of many mills at a cost of roughly $9.4 billion. The switch would cost an additional $2.4 billion per year because chlorine-free production is a less effective and less well-known method of manufacturing. The cost across all industries of a chlorine-free society, given current technology, would approach $91 billion annually.</P><P>     The EPA has proposed a regulation that &quot;only&quot; eliminates the use of elemental chlorine in pulp and paper manufacture. Chlorine compounds such as chlorine dioxide (ClO) are permitted. This is the mildest response we could expect from an agency where politics often trumps science.</P><P>     Ultimately, the effort to ban chlorine is not a simple struggle between greedy industries and good, public-spirited environmentalists. Alleged defenders of the public interest reap money and power by advocating and enforcing regulations. If successful, they often divert time, money and personnel from genuine and important environmental risks. This is the social cost of crisis entrepreneurship.</P><P>     Industrial chemicals are produced for beneficial public purposes, not for corporate whim. Although we should insist that these chemicals be managed in an environmentally responsible manner, we should also be vigilant toward those who amplify and exploit public concerns and reap private gains. No one has a monopoly on virtue or knowledge.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>MANY people share my deep concern with improving and protecting the wildlife, watersheds, and recreation values of forests. Good policy links these goods with sound economic practices. All require landowners' confidence in the future. The proposed export ban on raw logs from private lands subverts this confidence and undermines the management required to reach these goals.</P><P>       Proponents of the export ban claim it will save jobs and prevent foreign exploitation of our timber resources. These claims reflect poor thinking or personal interests promoted at the public's expense, not legitimate economic, ethical or environmental arguments.</P><P>     A ban on private log exports has several important, negative effects. It undermines the value of private stands of trees. A ban reduces the prices bid for raw logs and the timber's value. Private owners fear that future laws or regulations may further reduce the value of their timber. Owners and exporters who suffer a politically induced loss today are wary about the possibility of future losses. Hence an export ban shortens investors' time horizons.</P><P>     Trees take a long time to become harvestable; 50 to 100 years is common. Many of us prefer even older forests for we want forests to produce old-growth values. This is what Jerry Franklin and Jack Ward Thomas' &quot;New Forestry&quot; is about: managing forests to resemble old growth.</P><P>     If someone is to invest money, effort and time growing and preserving trees for a lifetime or longer, they need strong assurances that their timber's value will not be reduced by unexpected government intervention. The value of their land depends on expectations of the future value of their trees.</P><P>     Lower timber values immediately reduce people's incentives to preserve and grow timber. Mere talk of a ban could induce some people to log immediately, just as the possibility of endangered species moving to a landowner's land leads many to destroy suitable habitat. A desire to leave the timber market could encourage the rapid conversion of timberland close to cities to residential or commercial use.</P><P>     Moreover, if owners fear for the future, they plant short-rotation monocultures, trees such as cottonwood and eucalyptus that can be harvested for fiber in 10 years or less. By reducing the time between planting and harvest, they reduce the risk of new, unfavorable laws. A ban thus helps promote monocultures and shorter harvest rotations. Do proponents of an export ban really want this?</P><P>        The incentives an export ban creates for timber owners have significant environmental consequences. The public goods associated with long-rotation forests - complex ecosystems, wildlife habitat, biodiversity and aesthetics - will be reduced. We can also expect increased soil erosion, stream siltation and damaged salmon runs.</P><P>     It is important to remember that the most sensitive and valuable ecosystems - those found in old-growth forests - are largely confined to the national forests and parks. Raw log exports from federal forestland have been banned for 25 years. Most private lands harbor second- and third-growth forests. We want their owners to have the means and incentive to adopt ecologically friendly new forestry. An export ban has the opposite impact.</P><P>     A ban will also induce Japan to import more logs from Third World nations that have less stringent environmental protections than the United States. Increasing the demand for their timber is likely to increase environmental damage abroad. Do environmentalists really wish to increase environmental pressures in places with weak democratic institutions and ineffective environmental protections?</P><P>        The employment impact of an export ban, much like the environmental consequences, is sometimes misunderstood. Raw log exports cost few, if any, U.S. jobs. Instead, they create many high-paying jobs in export-related industries such as ocean shipping and inland rail. In addition, the premium foreign timber consumers pay for raw logs is additional money injected into the U.S. economy. Nor are bans likely to protect mill jobs. For example, the 1979 ban of red cedar exports failed to halt a decline in Washington cedar mills from 337 to 52.</P><P>     Raw log exports also lead to the purchase of forest products such as wooden doors and paneling. Raw logs introduce foreign consumers to the quality of U.S. products. The initial exposure builds contacts and leads to the purchase of our timber products. Commerce Department data reveals that processed products comprise 89 percent of the $17 billion market in U.S. forest products exports.</P><P>     Thus, neither economic theory nor historical experience supports the belief that a ban will preserve U.S. jobs. The Center for International Trade and Forestry's (CINTRAFOR) computer model, backed by 10 years of research, supports this criticism. Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and others who support the ban base their position on bad economics or expedient politics, not the public interest.</P><P>     A ban on exports has negative economic and environmental consequences. It contains disincentives to long-term forestry, to environmentally valuable habitat preservation, to jobs in the Northwest and elsewhere, and to increasing the sale of finished wood products in foreign markets. But most important, it erodes the ethical foundations of our society and political economy. The ethical problem alone is sufficient reason to strongly oppose the ban.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           WHEN considering the proposed &quot;Ancient Forest Summit&quot; or &quot;Timber Summit&quot; (word choice is significant), we should carefully segregate our hopes from our expectations. Yet I'm hopeful that the summit will increase understanding and improve policy. Here's why.</P><P>       Twenty years ago my colleagues and I at Montana State University advocated market incentives and property rights as environmental tools. Few considered this a viable option. Environmentalists and journalists considered us &quot;the wild bunch of Montana.&quot; We were the academic analogs of gunslingers and cowboys.</P><P>     But today this emphasis on incentives is becoming mainstream. Many environmental leaders who once considered pollution sin against nature (and as such immune from economic analysis) now favor market incentives to control it. However, the concept of private property rights has not gained this acceptance. In fact, property rights are under siege. The April summit could be decisive in this struggle of ideas.</P><P>     Environmental regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, often threaten property rights. They constrain land-use options, reducing income and land value. Few owners are indifferent to this outcome - especially when they are not compensated for their lost opportunities. Here in the Northwest with our high timber values and spotted owl controversies, the situation is especially dramatic.</P><P>     The problem with the spotted owl is primarily one of scale. It is not just a golf course or a shopping mall that is being challenged by an endangered species. If we were to protect the 900 or so owl circles in Washington, 1.5 million acres of land would be restricted from logging. Clearly, owl circles dramatically threaten the property rights of many landowners. This impact is significant. As an estimate, enough lumber to build 3.5 million homes would be withheld.</P><P>     America's founders understood the importance of secure property rights. They saw how people in other times and other lands used the government to transfer wealth. To help preclude this they gave us the Fifth Amendment's clause, &quot;. . .  nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation  . . .&quot; They designed our laws and regulations to encourage productive, rather than predatory, activities.</P><P>     Environmentalists sometimes favor regulations that strip value from property. Taking seems cheaper than buying. It isn't. Actions have unintended consequences. When property rights are threatened, behavior changes. People lose incentives to be good stewards of their land. They have incentives to &quot;cut out and get out.&quot; This process is evident on the timber lands of Western Washington, Oregon and California; people fearing land-use regulations understandably act before they lose opportunities to do so.</P><P>     Friends often tell me, &quot;We can't afford to pay for the environments we must save.&quot; But if voters lack the taste and understanding to pass bonds to buy lands for environmental preservation, are we to impose our tastes and &quot;take&quot; land by regulation? Ethically, can we impose our values upon others, even for a &quot;good&quot; cause? When should individual choice and freedom be sacrificed to environmental ends? The answers are seldom obvious.</P><P>     Some who testify at the summit are likely to justify uncompensated takings with environmental appeals. Before accepting such views, I suggest we consider ecologist Garrett Hardin's question: &quot;And then what?&quot; Much of what follows from threats of takings can be anticipated - e.g., cutting timber before it's &quot;taken&quot; by regulation. The &quot;Shoot, shovel, and shut-up&quot; approach to endangered species is another reaction to these threats of takings.</P><P>     I hope the summit will explain how we can move toward a harmony of environmental protection and private property rights. Secure property rights are essential to liberty, they foster prosperity, and promote environmental health. These values are interdependent.</P><P>     Rather than increase the threat of regulation, environmentalists at the summit should help private landowners realize the ecological values of their lands. Conservation easements, endowment funds for endangered species, and recreation user fees are all based upon property rights. We have a host of mechanisms that allow and encourage individuals to express their environmental concern with economic means. The summit can identify, publicize and promote them.</P><P>     I suggest that while our hopes for the summit are bountiful, our expectations should be spare. Political management has been with us for many years and people are accustomed to it. In the late 1800's, the Progressive Era reformers identified serious problems with America's environment. Unfortunately, their diagnosis of causes was flawed. Their reforms promoted bureaucratic, command-and-control resource management. The results were often disastrous.</P><P>     Nearly a century later a new group of &quot;progressives&quot; is again addressing these problems. We can expect better solutions only if President Clinton and others understand the possibilities and the limits of both property rights and bureaucratic approaches. As we await the summit, please keep your hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IN every language the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; bears a crust of derision.</P><P> This is no accident, for bureaucratic incentives invariably produce problems. Bureaucracies tend to replace the goals that justified their creation with actions that protect their budgets. The good news is that we can harness this fatal propensity in a way that will improve government and reduce its costs. While our plan won't do it all, here is a beginning.</P><P>     President Clinton's appeal for mutual sacrifice in the form of higher taxes and foregone benefits have been well-received. Our new president is an excellent political salesman. And many Americans are sufficiently responsible to be willing to buy the goods. But if special interests undermine success, citizens will feel betrayed.</P><P>     Here is a decision rule for such budget-cutting: Programs that are both economically wasteful and environmentally destructive will be zeroed out. Logging subsidies and most new Bureau of Reclamation water projects fall in this category. But that is not enough. Cuts must go deeper, to the myriad &quot;demonstration&quot; projects and special initiatives that riddle every appropriations bill.</P><P>     In the abstract, cutting spending is appealing. Most people feel that much of their tax bill is wasted by the government. But specific programs that benefit special interests have strong supporters. In contrast, few taxpayers have an incentive to lobby against specific programs; the portion of their tax bill going to any item other than entitlements is quite small. The average citizen has little incentive to become active while the beneficiaries have strong reasons to fight for their programs.</P><P>       This problem is the classic one of &quot;factions&quot; that so concerned Madison and the founders of our nation. The temptation of politicians to concentrate benefits and disperse costs has been the ruin of democracy through the ages. As we became a society based upon transfer payments, government was transformed from an agency of order to an engine of plunder.</P><P>     So in addition to dealing honestly with entitlements, how can we cut major chunks from the federal budget? The accumulated programs that have led to our crisis develop strong and stable constituencies. Such programs are best headed off in their infancy. One way is to create a government agency that draws funding solely from successful attempts to eliminate and pare back both existing and newly proposed government programs; let's consider a predatory bureaucracy.</P><P>     The Bureau of Reclamation proposed rebuilding the Teton Dam, a structure that failed when first filled in 1976. This dam had damaging ecological consequences and the economic costs far outweighed the economic benefits. Yet interests, such as those who expected to benefit from subsidized irrigation, lobbied for it.</P><P>     A predatory agency would marshal its resources against this project, employing ecologists, economists, and local residents who like the river as it is. They would advertise these costs to Congress. If the dam were cut, our predatory bureaucracy would receive 1 percent of the project's estimated costs and the Bureau of Reclamation's operating budget would decrease by the same 1 percent. The predatory bureaucracy would thus thrive only if it were successful at eliminating programs, and the offending department, in this case the Bureau of Reclamation, would be punished not only by losing this project, but by losing an additional portion of its budget.</P><P>     This system would provide incentives for government to police itself against waste and pork barrel projects, both by the predator and the prey, as projects are weeded out in anticipation of attack by the predator agency. Such a department could be established with a single two-year appropriation. After the first two years, it would exist solely upon funds gleaned from cut programs. Its size would vary just as predator numbers follow the size of prey populations.</P><P>     The proposal is not without its drawbacks. I find the creation of another bureaucracy somewhat offensive but this is a problem of political economy, not political theology where sin is well-defined. It is also possible that some worthwhile projects might be killed. But the real question is whether the benefits outweigh the costs. And on this score, it is likely to be quite successful.</P><P>     The fundamental logic behind this proposal is that bureaucracies are driven by their budgets. Just as corporations are driven to seek profits, government agencies seek to maximize their budget. They normally do this by pleasing a special-interest clientele. Our proposal would utilize that insight by creating an agency which, to increase its budget, would cannibalize the unsound proposals of other bureaucracies. In doing so it would foster the public interest rather than special interests.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>I'VE sent my check to the Salvation Army for the relief of California's earthquake victims (Salvation Army, Earthquake Fund, 615 Slaters Lane, P.O. Box 269, Alexandria, VA 22313). People are in genuine distress and there is clearly a need for outside help. But I've also written letters to my congressional representatives, urging them to not provide federal aid for long-term relief. This is because I firmly believe long-term federal aid does more harm than good.</P><P>       In the last century, when we were much poorer and more vulnerable, efforts to dispense federal disaster aid met fierce resistance. For example, the Texas Seed Bill of 1887, a measure to distribute $10,000 to help farmers in drought-stricken Texas, was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. Why veto so small a sum for so good a cause? Cleveland justified his action stating: &quot;A prevalent tendency to disregard the (government's) limited mission  . . . should be steadfastly resisted to (enforce the lesson) that, though the people support the Government, the Government should not support the people.&quot; Cleveland was being compassionate, not cruel, and his advice remains sound today. He understood the slippery slope of political aid.</P><P>     Providing voluntary aid to one's fellow citizens is admirable, and emergency federal assistance (e.g., tents, food and water, and National Guard troops) for areas struck by major natural disasters is justified. Such aid serves a humanitarian purpose in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. It is cruel to apply narrowly economic criteria during this period. But it is vital that economic incentives play a major role during the recovery. Long-term federal aid that reduces the costs of rebuilding or repairing homes and other property is a subsidy. Like most subsidies, it distorts useful economic incentives and has perverse consequences.</P><P>     The problem is twofold. First, when people do not bear the consequences of their actions they are encouraged to build and live in places prone to disasters, e.g., flood plains and earthquake zones. Second, the availability of federal aid encourages officials to grant disaster aid to areas that lack genuine need. We have seen raids on the Treasury grow ever larger as people come to expect federal bailouts.</P><P>     The first problem is easy to understand. It is an example of what economists call &quot;moral hazard.&quot; When people are not responsible for the full costs of their actions, they behave in riskier (i.e., potentially more costly) ways. Thus, rental cars are often abused because the people who rent them never directly pay for the wear and tear they inflict on transmissions or brakes. Very similar are people who build on earthquake faults, flood plains or barrier islands if they receive insurance that subsidizes the cost of repairing damaged homes, cars and so forth. They take fewer precautions, precautions that may extend to not living, or building expensive structures, in disaster-prone locations.</P><P>     The moral question to ask is not whether people who are suffering should be helped, but what incentives are we creating for future behavior? If the government encourages unsafe construction practices and locations via subsidies, the human and material costs of disasters will only grow larger than otherwise. This includes significant environmental costs because many disaster-prone locations have substantial biological or aesthetic value. In effect, by helping victims now, we create many more victims, human and ecological, later.</P><P>     The second consideration is equally important. It may have been President Cleveland's main concern. As long as federal disaster subsidies remain, politicians will have significant incentives to acquire those monies, even if they have not suffered anything remotely approximating a disaster. The prospect of receiving federal aid may have prompted Montana's governor to declare a state of emergency following the eruption of Mount St. Helens (May 18, 1980), even though the post-eruption situation in Montana was far from disastrous.</P><P>     When aid is available, opportunism can color decisions. President Clinton had incentives to move quickly to disburse emergency aid in part because of California's importance to his re-election and to the 1994 congressional races. Making federal aid available during real disasters generates pleas for such aid when more local and perhaps private efforts would suffice. Eventually, disaster aid disproportionately goes to the politically shrewd or powerful. Moreover, the generosity of federal aid programs rachets upward while non-federal matching proportions slide.</P><P>     Even when raw political considerations are not paramount, the question remains: Where do we draw the line? When do disasters merit federal subsidies? Clear distinctions are impossible and the mindset &quot;they got theirs and I should get mine&quot; dominates since relative need or merit cannot be exactly determined.</P><P>     Direct federal costs grow, politicians feed on federal monies, and worst of all, the impulse toward private giving is eroded. The loss of such civic virtue is of vital concern, but is exceedingly difficult to measure. Its presence builds bonds of fellowship among Americans.</P><P>     We should feel compassion for the quake victims. But let us not pursue policies that foster worse situations in the future. It is tempting to open the federal purse. But we should do so with great reluctance, realizing that some consequences are quite negative. President Cleveland got it right: the government should not support the people. It is indeed a slippery slope.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

Baden</P><P>I'M home at the ranch for the holidays, recalling Christmas traditions.</P><P>      Both my family and my wife feed our animals special rations on Christmas morning. My grandmother would bake oatmeal biscuits with lots of meat trimmings for their dog and a warm corn mash for her chickens. Granddad would give the cows and sheep leafy, second-cutting clover and the horses extra oats, even though they wouldn't work that day. My wife, Ramona, and her father would take a toboggan-load of hay to the old buffalo bulls on the Targhee National Forest.</P><P>     The ewes on our Montana ranch, bred to lamb in March, were on maintenance rations: 7 bales of hay for each 100 ewes. As they became heavy with lambs, we fed more and more of ever more nutritious feed. Yet, on Christmas, we'd give them a treat and a preview of good food to come: second-cutting alfalfa and some soybean cake.</P><P>     In financial terms this made no sense, but the sheep loved it and we felt warm. We depended on our animals and they on us. Each Christmas we'd give them more than good husbandry.</P><P>     Urban people can't easily celebrate Christmas by pampering livestock. However, they can still do a good deed for animals, predators and, later, those lower on the food chain, by restoring balance to the system. My proposal even fits with the new mood in Washington, D.C. Here it is.</P><P>     After writing your holiday letters to friends and loved ones, write another to your senators and member of Congress asking them to cut off the federal Animal Damage Control (ADC) program.</P><P>     The program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The ADC's program is quite broad. It helps protect corn and sunflowers from blackbirds, airplanes from hawks, geese, and owls, and pasture land from prairie dogs. However, the ADC's largest single mission is livestock protection (or predator control) in Western states. With overhead, its livestock protection costs run $13 million a year.</P><P>     Many of us find the ADC's predator-control program offensive. Not only has ADC exterminated wolves, bears, and mountain lions in many of the contiguous 48 states, it employs barbaric methods. Many people find cyanide poisoning, steel leg traps and aerial hunts offensive. We carried rifles to protect stock from rogue animals, but ADC is indiscriminate, killing problem animals and innocents alike.</P><P>     Even people indifferent to animal welfare should question the value of the ADC. ADC efforts are allocated politically. A series of National Academy of Sciences reports consistently indicate these efforts don't significantly reduce livestock predation. This is again documented by Randal O'Toole in his magazine, Different Drummer.</P><P>     It shouldn't be so expensive to kill animals, but federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act all constrain ADC's effectiveness. These laws divert time and money from predator control to environmental-impact reports. We again find the government doing inefficiently something it shouldn't be doing at all.</P><P>     Congress' desire to use predator control as a re-election tool means that funds are politically targeted to favored congressional districts not, for example, spent on non-lethal research. Congress targeted $2.1 million to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds and $248,000 to protect maple trees from squirrels during 1987-1994. These funds overwhelmingly went to states with congressional representatives on the agricultural subcommittees of the appropriations committees. Nearly 40 percent of the ADC's federal funds accrue to the 27,000 ranchers who graze livestock on public lands. The average subsidy is $550 per year, and far more for those ranchers who have permits for cheap grazing on federal rangelands.</P><P>     Concentrating the ADC's benefits on politically connected people makes little economic sense. Losses to predators or other wildlife are a cost of doing business. We lowered coyote, bear and mountain lion predation by placing guard dogs with our sheep. This was expensive and time intensive but ultimately a good investment.</P><P>     The mere existence of the ADC encourages ranchers and farmers to take fewer private precautions against predator losses. Subsidies short-circuit market signals telling us which areas are best suited for range stock operations. A bounty for coyote pelts - paid by stock growers associations, not by taxpayers who object to the practices - would be significantly cheaper and surely more ethical. Should a committed vegetarian be forced to subsidize this killing?</P><P>       Subsidizing the destruction of animals is offensive on ecological, ethical and economic grounds. It is past time to put ADC away. Do something nice for animals this holiday season by writing Washington, D.C. And be sure to copy Newt.</P><P>_______</P><P> John A.

This provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was passed in 1958. It bans any additive in any detectable levels in processed food if the additive has been shown to cause cancer in humans or laboratory animals.</P><P>       The law seems to make sense. Who wants a cancer-causing substance added to their food? But its broadly stated mandate does not reflect today's scientific knowledge and our growing awareness of health risks.</P><P>     The Delaney Clause is subject to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC charged, accurately, that the EPA was failing to enforce the Delaney Clause. It was, because EPA realized that it was an unworkable law that does more to threaten our nation's health than help it. However, a California judge ordered EPA to follow the law.</P><P>     The EPA's response to the decision was twofold: It began to list the chemicals that would be banned if it were forced to follow the letter of the law and it asked Congress to amend the law to reflect current scientific understanding.</P><P>     The scientific problems are many. Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer our modern techniques of testing substances for cancer effects. He is now among the methods' chief critics. He cites two concerns.</P><P>     The first has to do with the testing method of feeding populations of animals the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of a chemical, the dose just below that which causes death. After exposure the animals are examined for cancerous growths.</P><P>     The problem is that the &quot;dose-response&quot; curve is unlikely to be linear, that is, continuous high exposures are likely to be more dangerous than long-term low exposures. A substance's ability to cause cancer at 50 or 5000 times the average daily intake level may tell us nothing about its effect upon cancer risk at smaller, more likely doses. As a government scientific panel announced in the Federal Register, &quot;the implicit assumptions underlying extrapolations from the MTD . . . do not appear to be valid.&quot;</P><P>       The second problem is transferring lab results on mice to human populations. Mice and rats are more closely related to one another than to humans. However, one will often test negative while the other will test positive for the same chemical.</P><P>     Dr. Ames also points out that it is not only man-made substances that cause cancer. Using the same disputed techniques, he found a variety of other naturally occurring chemicals, present in substances from peanut butter to broccoli, that also cause cancer in test animals.</P><P>     In contrast to what was believed when Delaney was passed, experts today believe that, aside from workers who are exposed to massive doses, not more than 1-3 percent of cancer cases can be attributed to man-made chemicals. The vast majority are due to genetics and lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or fatty foods.</P><P>     Of course, to those who campaign for public health, 3 percent is still too much. But they lose sight of the fact that relative, not absolute, risk is the important measure. Most chemicals are present for a reason. They help to control pests and bacteria. They lengthen shelf life. All act in ways that reduce the price of food and often the real danger associated with eating it. The result of strict enforcement of Delaney would likely be greater scarcity of some foods, price increases, and increased likelihood of contamination.</P><P>     The environment might also suffer as more harmful substances are used. In Wisconsin, for example, farmers would likely switch to copper- or tin-based compounds to protect their potato crops from blight. Ultimately, this practice would poison their soils with the accumulation of heavy metals.</P><P>     So by banning pesticides, we may increase other risks, shifting dangers elsewhere. But we cannot eliminate all risks, only choose intelligently among them. This requires a careful analysis of relative risks, not legislation where emotions trump science.</P><P>     EPA's suggestion to relax Delaney is likely to face a tough battle in Congress. Few senators and representatives want to be portrayed as voting for cancer. Cancer is complex, emotional, and scary. And certainly we should seek to lower cancer risks when reasonable. But it is relative risks, what happens on the margins, that matter. To promote a safe and affordable food supply, lets be alert to environmental hyperbole and posturing while respecting medical science and the economics of risk reduction. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

Baden</P><P> Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973 to protect species threatened or in danger of extinction.  Federal judges have an especially difficult time dealing with it.  In the ESA, they confront nasty conflicts between Congressional intent to save endangered species and our Bill of Rights.  </P><P><CITE>In Saving All the Pieces</CITE>, Rocky Barker notes that federal mandates generally require agencies to provide protection 'when practicable'.  But the ESA is different.  Protection of all species is absolute.  There is no room for equivocation; no provision for tradeoffs among competing legitimate and important values.  An endangered species trumps all other values.  </P><P>The Fifth Amendment to our Constitution concludes with, &quot;...nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;  It's not in the Bill of Rights by accident.  It was intended to preclude plundering by politicians and bureaucrats, what ever their justification.  Americans' experience with the ESA demonstrates why the Founders were so concerned with uncompensated takings.  </P><P>The application of the ESA demonstrates the mischief and unintended consequences which follow when we attempt to take value from individuals without &quot;just compensation&quot;.  When endangered species are found on private land,  the owners lose opportunities to undertake legitimate actions.  Land value is often reduced, sometimes eliminated.  Consequences are bound to follow.  Many of them harm habitat of endangered species.</P><P>Many well intentioned environmental activists discount, ignore or pretend these losses away.  This seems intellectually and ethically irresponsible.  But what if ecological integrity trumps both the ethics of the case and the value of logical consistency?  Honorable people could hold this position.  </P><P>The ecological goals which motivated the Act's creation maintain wide support.  It's the commando approach, seize control of the land, which causes problems for species and people.  Let's consider the environmental consequences of takings by the ESA's administrators.  We will keep two ecological guidelines in mind; we can never do only one thing, and everything is tied to everything else.  These principles are as valid in political economy as in ecology.</P><P>The Act commonly transforms harmless and inherently cute critters including the Spotted Owl and Red-cockaded woodpecker, into enemies of the landowner.  Animals such as the gray wolf and grizzly bear, creatures which can pose genuine threats to people or property, carry a double burden.  If we care to protect them (and I do), and if we were to name one group of individuals whom we should want to like an endangered species, it surely would be its host, the land owner.  Why make them foes of ESA's goals?</P><P>The Act grants unprecedented powers to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, some even greater than powers of the Department of Defense in wartime. The Third Amendment of our Bill of Rights states that: &quot;No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law&quot;.  Various creatures, some quite unappealing to most people, have greater rights.  The government must pay for what it takes when supplying our military.  This is why it is so difficult to close down a base.  In contrast, the land owner suffers if The Fish and Wildlife Service finds a listed species on her land. </P><P>The exercise of these powers under the ESA has perverse but predictable consequences.  The land owner has few incentives to protect habitat for the species and strong incentives to modify it preemptively to make it less attractive.  Alternatively, he may simply &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up&quot;.  The Act encourages land owners to break the spirit and the letter of the law.  This is not a sustainable policy for protecting endangered species.  And it's not achieving its goals.  </P><P>This is why an increasing number of environmental advocates believe it's time to rethink the Act.  The ESA is one troublesome example of keeping our Progressive Era's &quot;scientific management&quot; approach in place long after it was found wanting.  Many distinguished analysts are having second thoughts about the ESA and the entire scientific management, command-and-control approach which it represents.  </P><P>Professor Robert Nelson teaches Public Policy at the University of Maryland after spending two decades as a senior researcher in the Department of Interior, the home agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  He predicts that over the next twenty or thirty years new approaches will replace the failed system.  Nelson believes the current period has many similarities with the Progressive Era.  In his words, &quot;A new set of ideas and a new institutional framework are required, just as the progressives saw such a need one hundred years ago.&quot;  </P><P>A century ago American Progressives saw serious problems in America.  Many of these came from the ability of business to neglect a public interest in favor of narrow self interest.  Businesses could ignore costs imposed on others.  The Progresives' solution was to impose regulation and management by wise and competent bureaucrats.  </P><P>Today, the ESA follows this model to its logical but counterproductive conclusion.  It clearly is time for serious second thoughts about better ways to protect endangered species.  Reform requires that we acknowledge the importance of secure property rights and regulatory stability.  As the Founding Fathers understood, it's too expensive to permit government to take things for free.  </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

Baden</P><P>     Whether we're trying to save species or specie, decisions are based on information and incentives.  Reform that generates poor incentives simply won't work.  Good intentions are not enough.</P><P>     Congress tried to protect endangered species via the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  Prior to 1973, landowners could operate even if their activities harmed the habitat of endangered species.  This was a problem.  Lawmakers saw prohibition of such activities as the answer.  It wasn't.  </P><P>     While well intentioned, the ESA produces many unintended and adverse consequences.  It tried to force landowners to maintain habitat.  This made endangered species the enemy of landowners.  It pits socially valuable activities such as forestry and farming against habitat protection.  </P><P>     The Act empowers the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control private lands harboring endangered species.  They can ignore the lost opportunities imposed.  Social or landowner costs don't enter their calculations.  The administrators have no incentive to economize when protecting habitat.   </P><P>     This command-and-control approach pits landowners against endangered species.  Landowners fear the liability of owning endangered species habitat; its use may be restricted without any compensation.  Today's ESA encourages people to modify habitat.  Biologists consult with landowners to find ways to make their land inhospitable.  Ironically, the ESA's mandate to protect habitat often encourages landowners to repel endangered species.</P><P>     We have real and tragic examples across America.  Cone's Folly is an illustrative case.  In the 1930s Ben Cone, Sr. purchased 7,200 acres of land in North Carolina.  His friends called it &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; for it was deforested.  With careful sylvaculture by Ben Cone, Sr., and later Ben Cone, Jr., the &quot;folly&quot; became a well managed forest.  Fish, game, and non-game critters became abundant.  </P><P>     They actively managed for wildlife with frequent controlled burns and carefully managed small timber sales.  Their stands of rare long leaf pines were ideal for much wildlife.  Cone's stewardship attracted many songbirds, deer, quail, wild turkey, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker.  </P><P>     In 1991, the ESA required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to halt Cone's management of the 1560 acres of property inhabited by 29 of the rare woodpeckers.  Cone lost rights to cut and sell the timber on nearly two-and-half square miles of his land, drastically reducing its value.  He received no compensation and must still pays taxes for timberland unharvestable while woodpecker habitat.  The woodpeckers he once liked became a multi-million dollar liability.   </P><P>     Cone now clearcuts around the woodpecker haven.  This prevent them from infecting more of his property.  And neighboring landowners have rushed to do likewise before their land also becomes suitable for woodpeckers.  </P><P>     The chart shows how the Act dramatically changed Cone's harvesting practices after 1991.  Cone reduced the rotation of harvest from 80 years to 40 years, thereby eliminating the old stands that attract the woodpeckers.   The ESA has given the woodpeckers a temporary safe haven.  It will eventually rot or burn, the woodpeckers will move, and Cone will regain control.</P><P>     Ironically, the ESA has given &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; a whole new meaning.  Ben Cone's folly was to take such good care of the land that the ESA stripped much of the value from more than a fifth of his property.</P><P>     &quot;Cone's Folly&quot; is one of the many cases demonstrating the importance of incentives to habitat protection.  &quot;Takings&quot; produce predictable but unintended consequences.  When landowners who harbor endangered species face stiff penalties for doing so, they minimize suitable habitat.  Those of us who care about endangered species want landowners to favor the creatures and eagerly provide habitat.  Can this be achieved by government coercion and &quot;takings&quot;?  At what cost?  Are there better ways?</P><P>     Compensating landowners for the costs of maintaining suitable habitats for species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and spotted owl removes some costs of doing so.  If regulations are stable and agencies forced to face the costs of their actions they will seek more efficient protection.  </P><P>     Tax breaks for habitat motivates landowners to provide it.  And many species already have interest groups advocating their protection.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the North American Wild Sheep Foundation protect two formerly threatened species.  Furthermore, information would improve as wildlife biologists would find entrepreneurial niches consulting landowners on how to create, rather than avoid, suitable habitat.  </P><P>     Landowners, like the habitat they own, are diverse.  There are huge untapped opportunities for improving and protecting habitat.  We might not expect ranchers to welcome wolves or timber companies to embrace beavers.  But beavers don't eat livestock, and wolves don't eat trees.  Plum Creek Timber Co., Inc. agreed and found dens for wolves.  Defenders of Wildlife benefits when wolves find dens, the wolves most certainly benefit, and Plum Creek benefits from publicity and cash awards.  </P><P>     With positive incentives we can harmonize prosperity and environmental diversity.  This must be the foundation of any successful reform of the ESA.  Otherwise we risk more counterproductive policies which condemn both landowners and rare species.</P><P>___________________<BR>John A.

Baden</P><P>LAST week, the Mont Pelerin Society met in Cannes, France, to celebrate the work of its founder, Nobel Prize winning economist Friedrich Hayek.</P><P>       The Mont Pelerin Society is the world's foremost group of classical liberal academic, business and governmental leaders.</P><P>     Six of its 500 members, including Milton Friedman, Gary Becker and George Stigler, a Seattle native, have received Nobel Prizes in economics. This year's keynote address was given by Vaclav Klaus, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.</P><P>     The Mont Pelerin Society was formed in 1947 by people who feared that communist, fascist and socialist regimes would dominate the world.</P><P>     They were prescient in anticipating the crisis of the socialist enterprise, discussed in Professor Daniel Chirot's book &quot;The Crisis of Leninism: The Decline of the Left and the Revolutions of 1989.&quot; They sought to reassert the values of liberty, private property and toleration of people of diverse religious, ethnic and racial backgrounds.</P><P>     Today's members are ahead of the curve in understanding the ethical and economic problems inherent in America's pervasive bureaucratization and regulation of private affairs. Their perspective can help us develop environmental reforms that are both sensitive and practical.</P><P>     I believe that Hayek's classic 1945 article from the American Economic Review, &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; is the best introduction to economics ever written.</P><P>     Hayek shows us how economies are like ecosystems. They are interdependent, complex, and must constantly adjust. When we read this article, we can better understand why there are such huge conflicts between bureaucracies, which drive toward uniformity, and ecosystems, where knowledge of local circumstances is critically important.</P><P>     Planning fails because the information needed to create products and coordinate human activity is widely scattered. Central planners, like everyone else, can obtain only a tiny fraction of this knowledge, and are thereby precluded from serving people's economic desires and fostering innovation.</P><P>     Hayek's simple, yet tremendously powerful and far-reaching insight has grown in importance over time. Economies, like ecosystems, cannot be designed. No one can run them. Both evolve and prosper to the extent that their inhabitants remain in sync with the laws of nature.</P><P>     A capitalist ecosystem is populated by organizations and industries rather than organisms and species.</P><P>     Economic life evolves by technological innovation and market competition much as biological life evolves by genetic mutation and natural selection. Both involve intricate webs of innumerable participants, each pursuing his own interests, but linked into a whole greater than the sum of the parts.</P><P>     Hayek's legacy is powerful because his insights are timeless; they speak to all ages and cultures. But equally important, they have been vindicated by experience. As he warned in &quot;The Road to Serfdom,&quot; socialism has failed everywhere it was tried at the national level, creating police state nightmares from Utopian dreams and economic chaos from &quot;rational planning.&quot;</P><P>       One of socialism's many victims was environmental quality. Throughout the former U.S.S.R. the legacy of bureaucracies' single-minded focus on industrialization and production is starkly evident.</P><P>     For example, at Russia's Magnitogorsk, site of the world's biggest steel complex, 90 percent of the children born in the city suffered from pollution-related illnesses. Feshbach and Friendly, authors of &quot;Ecocide in the U.S.S.R.,&quot; state that in 1992, &quot;there are no major industrial cities in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children.&quot;</P><P>       Aside from a few professors insulated from reality, Americans realize that communism and socialism are corrupting and economically bankrupt systems. Less clear, but just as pernicious, are the consequences of our experiments in sylvan socialism, begun with the creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1897.</P><P>     The Forest Service was the prototype for much of environmental management. Our most recent major creation, the EPA, relies on the same assumptions with tragic consequences. For example, a joint EPA-Amoco Corporation study of Amoco's Yorktown refinery found that EPA-mandated pollution controls were three times more costly than necessary. By making environmental protection more expensive, the EPA reduces the amount of protection people demand and can afford.</P><P>     As we prepare to celebrate the centennial of the Forest Service, it is incumbent on us to consider the deficiencies of the socialist model. Hayek contributes to our understanding. By following his principles we can create policies that harmonize ecological and economic values.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A.

<P>	The epicenter of Ecotopia lies somewhere in the area encircled by Bellingham, Eugene, and Bozeman.  Four colleges of forestry, dozens of environmental groups, and busloads of environmental writers are based there.  Hence, the federal land management agencies are under intense scrutiny.  But even here, the institutional arrangements are so perverse that often management is grossly pathological, ecologically insensitive and economically wasteful   Many analysts now question the justification for federal management of commercial timber land.</P>

<P> 	The woeful performance of agencies like the Forest Service is not due to incompetent or evil people within those bureaucracies.  Rather, bad institutions generate incentives and information which lead smart, well-intentioned people to do harmful things.  The real need is for better economic and legal arrangements, not better people.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service came from progressive era fantasies a century ago.  In <CITE>Public Lands and Private Rights</CITE>, Robert Nelson of the University of Maryland describes the progressive's religion.  Their philosophy requires centralized management by scientifically trained professionals.  They believed that good management can only come from the government, from trained professionals in the Forest Service.  In their view the private sector was incapable of responsible forest management.  Increasingly, evidence mounts that the progressives had it exactly backwards.</P>

<P> 	Professor Nelson points out that, despite this conviction, &quot;the history of the public lands is filled with laws that had lofty purposes and achieve dismal results&quot;.  Bureaucratic politics trumps ecology, economics, and ethics.  Recent events in our Ecotopia illustrate the general problem. </P>

<P> 	275 acres of scorched or burned trees were sold in a remote pocket of the Thunder Mountains in the Okanogan National Forest, Washington.  The salvage logging rider to the 1995 Recissions Bill keeps the public from appeal the timber sale.  Politics exempted salvage sales from environmental regulations.  Logging this area imperils rare lynx habitat and salmon runs.</P>

<P> 	The Forest Service spent over $200,000 to plan the Thunder Mountain timber sale.  Its first offering in October yielded no bids from industry.  The Forest Service re-offered that sale two months later, after lowering environmental standards.  This time Omak Wood Products, Vaagen Brothers, and Acord placed bids.  However, they were outbid by the <A HREF="http://www.pacificrim.net/~nwea">Northwest Ecosystem Alliance</A> (NWEA), an environmental group.  Their $29,000 bid marks the first time an environmental group has outbid timber companies for logging rights.  This is a milestone in the co-evolution of environmentalism and economics.  </P>

<P> 	The USFS is likely to reject NWEA's high bid because they vow to let the trees stand.According to Mitch Friedman, NWEA's Executive Director, &quot;The best result for all concerned would be for the Forest Service to take our money.... and allow us to protect the trees for the length of a rotation - maybe 100 years.&quot;  Unfortunately, federal regulations mandate that purchasers be &quot;responsible for&quot; cutting the trees.  The Forest Service says it will disqualify purchasers who lack such &quot;integrity&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot;.</P>

<P> 	Throughout time and across cultures, wealth, education, and environmental concerns are positively correlated.  As education and prosperity levels rise, so do environmental sensitivities and interests.  But environmental amenities have long been thought of as luxury goods.  Gifford Pinchot, the first Forest Service chief, argued with John Muir that material considerations must trump all others.  The national forests were to be federally run as an efficient and responsible business.  </P>

<P> 	While resource extraction drove the American West's economy in 1897, diverse environmental values are helping drive the &quot;new&quot; West's emerging economy in 1997.  Recreation, biodiversity and scenic vistas, along with traditional commodities, represent vital economic resources.  Wildlands surrounding cities contribute to the high quality of life and attract businesses to Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies communities.  And, contrary to expectations of progressive era zealots, private timberland owners have proven far more efficient, innovative, and progressive than federal agencies.</P>

<P> 	Here's how the amenity economy evolves.  Public, non-governmental entrepreneurs identify the interests of those valuing the non-commodity features of forests.  But when environmental entrepreneurs aggregate these interests, they are often stymied by the bureaucratic politics of federal caretakers.  NWEA's high bid on Forest Service lands exemplifies this.  Professor Nelson, a U.S. Department of Interior economist for over 20 years, finds that, &quot;it is most of all the old scientific management theories of the progressive era that stand as a barrier to the development of new institutions for the public lands&quot;. </P>

<P> 	The Forest Service effectively blocks the evolutionary path of the forest economy.  The centralized planning imposed last century has failed to keep pace with the success of private forestry and with the complex and changing values of our modern economy.  Politics and the budgetary process systematically reward federal 'scientific managers' for losing money on environmentally destructive activities.  The Thunder Mountain salvage sale will cost the U.S. Treasury at least $171,000.  The costs of environmental amelioration will follow.  And the non-financial costs to lynx, salmon, lovers of these natural systems, and fiscal conservatives will be even higher.</P>

<P>	As we approach the centennial of the national forest system, it's time to ask if the federal government should even be involved in managing commercial timber.  Central planning fails in the Forest Service as it did in the Soviet Union.  It's time for second thoughts about sylvan socialism.</P>

BADEN</P><P>           IT is easy to be an enthusiastic supporter of recycling, especially in Seattle. Recycling requires little effort from consumers and appears to eliminate waste and alleviate pressures on the environment. Recycling is an easy choice for those who believe it will always save money and resources. They have little problem equating it with conservation and making it a litmus test for green values.</P><P>       But recycling is not always a wise idea. Like many good things it entails tradeoffs, tradeoffs that make its environmental effects ambiguous and dependent on local circumstances. Recycling consumes valuable labor, capital, time and urban space. It imposes environmental and economic costs through transportation, sorting, processing and remanufacturing and sometimes these costs outweigh the gains of reusing a resource. Without knowledge of the tradeoffs, a knowledge usually communicated through prices, it is difficult to make responsible decisions.</P><P>      Lynn Scarlett of the Reason Foundation is someone who has studied the tradeoffs inherent to recycling. She analyzed seven of the best curbside recycling programs in the United States and found that the net cost was $110 per ton after subtracting an average salvage value of $35 per ton. These were the best cases. The average net cost for curbside recycling is about $150 to $200 per ton. Much of the gap between costs and value is a deadweight loss, a needless waste of resources.</P><P>      However, Scarlett's results should not be taken to indicate that all recycling is inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Some early losses in recycling can be investments in experiments that may ultimately pay off. The problem is that it is difficult to determine whether recycling a specific object, such as plastic soft drink bottles (Polyethylene Terephthalate, or P.E.T.), makes environmental sense. Like so many things in life, it depends.</P><P>      One of the things on which it depends is our position on the recycling learning curve (i.e., how much we know about recycling an object). When producing any good, the first units are often quite expensive. For example, computing power used to be very expensive. The first computer, ENIAC, cost the U.S. government $3 million and delivered less computing power than a modern calculator. Today, the same computing power is available for roughly $30. This is the learning curve at its best - producing vastly better products at much lower prices. Though less dramatic, the same logic applies to recycling; the longer we recycle, the more efficient and effective we become.</P><P>      Now this rule only applies when recycling programs generate incentives to innovate and learn. Plans that do not, like Germany's &quot;green dot&quot; program, are extremely wasteful. The German system mandates that firms must recycle a certain percentage of their products. Like many government plans, it makes recycling a burden rather than an opportunity and thereby discourages innovation. We can expect far better results from recycling efforts designed by producers and supported by consumers.</P><P>      There are some attractive recycled products coming onto the market as firms ascend the learning curve. Patagonia, for example, has recently introduced a new Synchilla fleece. This fabric is 80 percent recycled fiber made from (P.E.T.) soda-pop bottles and 20 percent virgin polyester. It is slightly more expensive than the fabric it replaced and is not quite as soft. Nevertheless, people love the fleece and the idea behind it. Wholesalers have already sold out their fall stocks.</P><P>      BMW presents another example with the planned introduction of the first 100 percent recyclable car and auto-recycling facility. Both firms are using profits from sales of existing products to subsidize the development of recyclable products. In doing so they are pushing the market up the recycling learning curve.</P><P>      Efforts to recycle among firms producing luxury or high-end products offer an interesting dilemma. Although &quot;Beamers&quot; are often derided as yuppie toys and Patagonia satirized as &quot;Patagucci,&quot; the customers and stockholders of these firms are subsidizing movement up the learning curve. Their efforts to commercialize recycling provide a significant public good.</P><P>      As the technology pioneered by &quot;luxury&quot; firms advances and less-workable ideas are filtered out, the cost of producing recycled products decrease. (Today, P.E.T. is actually less expensive than virgin material for carpet fiber). This encourages wider use of recycled material. Firms serving larger markets, like WalMart and Costco, will ultimately feature recycled products as the most successful processes are refined.</P><P>      Recycling can be environmentally harmful and economically wasteful. Unfortunately, these problems are most likely when politics intervenes and obscures the existence of tradeoffs. Politics can push recycling too hard by mandating trendy but harmful and inefficient programs, like recycled content mandates. These approaches stifle innovation and creativity. Although the market is by no means perfect, when prices approximate full costs, it provides the best path toward socially and environmentally responsible products.</P><P>________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>TWICE I've cried in a movie. The first time I was 4 years old and saw Bambi. The second was in 1970, when I saw a tear-provoking &quot;documentary&quot; of a polar bear hunt.</P><P>       The few polar bears I've seen in the wild inspired awe and admiration. But during this film, a faux-sportsman was flown onto an ice flow where he killed, with a long range shot, a she bear. She had two young cubs who presumably would die of starvation and neglect. This was a repulsive act, one contrived to make sensitive people feel embarrassed to be hunters. It worked for me.</P><P>     People who share my interest and concern have no easy way to channel their feelings into effective action. As Adam Smith explained, when its hard to organize people, many worthwhile things aren't done. That's why we use government to protect endangered species - to reduce the difficulties of achieving group goals.</P><P>     But all institutions have imperfections. For-profit firms discount or ignore values lacking market prices. No-profit organizations have serious problems with recruitment and motivation. And when tasks are given to political organizations, decisions are made by political calculus where ecology, economics and equity are trumped by politics.</P><P>     So we have problems dealing with endangered species, especially those without commercial value. Corporations have weak incentives to preserve their habitat. No-profits find it difficult to mobilize support for species lacking romantic appeal. What about government?</P><P>       Don Coursey, a University of Chicago economist, considered endangered species for a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He identified the key issue: &quot;At a practical level of analysis, the country must decide how much to spend on protecting endangered species and how to distribute this amount among each endangered plant and animal.&quot;</P><P>       He went on to study the actual amount and distribution of spending on endangered species.</P><P>     Coursey observed that expenditures are determined by a competitive, complicated political process.</P><P>     Data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showed total state and federal expenditures on 247 endangered species totaled $84,894,000 in 1990. This excludes hidden regulatory costs imposed on people in the private sector.</P><P>     The 20 animals that receive the most attention and money tend to be &quot;charismatic megafauna,&quot; big romantic creatures such as the grizzly bear, woodland caribou, eastern cougar and large birds of prey.</P><P>     In contrast, the bottom 20 are obscure rodents, insects or snails. In a national survey, Coursey found that those animals that are highly rated by the public receive more money - a beauty pageant of endangered species.</P><P>     Professional ecologists and wildlife biologists differ from the general public. They weigh ecosystem balance, interdependencies, and genetic information more heavily and advocate systems that enable every species to exist and adapt.  They want ecological analogs to Noah's Ark.</P><P>     But we can't have it all. Choices will and must be  made. Noah's Ark is on a budget. And when these choices are made in the political arena, it is the public  rather than the scientists' values that drive policy.</P><P>     Popular versus elite preferences is a classic democratic problem. This creates ecological problems when the public's values conflict with the long term health of most species and ecosystems.</P><P>     Even when scientists have their technical facts straight and understand ecological cause and effect, they often exhibit naivete when considering political economy. Many advocate keeping species protection a primarily public enterprise.</P><P>     But as long as it remains with public, political institutions, it is dominated by the general public's  values and superficial understandings. Healthy ecosystems require we shield management from misinformation and ill-informed democratic opinions.</P><P>     Clearly, national and international governments must deal with large scale issues such as atmospheric pollution and migratory wildlife. However, many of the minor ecological treasures neglected by the public, the non-charismatic minifauna, have relatively modest requirements for their preservation.</P><P>     These are best handled by community-based voluntary groups which include scientists. Private sector, not-for-profit organizations can respond to local interests just as museums and schools cater to specialized tastes. Such organizations can avoid the problems created when profits or  political advantages are paramount.</P><P>     Some scientists have a strong antipathy to property rights and the market process. They ignore private sector innovations and cling to the mirage of benevolent, environmentally sensitive federal government.</P><P>       Following the Progressive Era myth of &quot;scientific management&quot; the government will someday empower them as philosopher kings of the ecological domain. Finally, they hope, after a 100 years of trying we may have finally got it right with Jack Ward Thomas running the U.S. Forest Service and Bruce Babbitt (temporarily) our Secretary of Interior.</P><P>     Both experience and theory tell us they are surely wrong. It is no accident that political spending and ecological integrity don't easily mix. In the political calculus, scientific opinion counts less than popular enthusiasm. Non-popular but scientifically well-founded views are more likely to prevail in the voluntary sector. This is where environmentalists should focus their efforts as we seek preservation and sustainable future.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

<H1>Park Lovers Can Save National Parks</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>As Americans flock to national parks this summer, we can learn a lot from national parks around the world.  Field biologists the world over uniformly confirm the woeful conditions of national parks.  <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A> found many national parks in Latin America are at great risk.  Even closer to home, Canada's experiments with national parks hold important lessons for parks lovers.</P>

<P>Canadian parks are now suffering from their reliance on fickle politics.  The Canadian analog of the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov">U.S. National Park Service</A>, Parks Canada, just lost $100 million dollars from its budget to operate 38 parks.  The U.S. park system has ten times as many parks and a budget of only $1.3 billion.</P>

<P>U.S. park managers, already short funding, cut popular services such as the Norris Campground in Yellowstone.  Let's consider alternative managerial arrangements in the U.S. before mounting financial pressures in Washington, D.C. force a repeat of Canada's predicament.</P>

<P>Public, nongovernment endowment boards, one for each park, hold great promise.  They successfully manage private schools, nonprofit hospitals, and museums.  Board members have trustee and fiduciary responsibility for their organization's specific mission.  The boards would be charged to manage for highest values: habitat, preservation, primitive recreation, scenery.  An endowment board with regional and national members could ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics.</P>

<P>Petty politics puts national parks at risk.  The 104th Congress is considering eliminating unworthy parks.  Although park budgets rose every year from 1955 to 1977, Congress has cut funding in one out of every three years since.  A quarter of park ranger jobs have disappeared since 1987, and there is a $3 billion maintenance backlog.  Our parks are in terrbile shape, ecologically and operationally.</P>

<P>While not providing adequate funding for existing parks, Congress creates new parks of highly questionable value, like Presidio and Steamtown.  This political trap has caught Canada, which just combined massive budget reductions for Parks Canada with the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park, now Canada's fifth largest.</P>

<P>Government support for parks is problematic for many reasons.  Politicizing national parks leads to &quot;park&quot; barrel projects and poor management incentives.  Sound science loses out when special interests can order the Park Service to eliminate Yellowstone's wolves in the 1920s and fires since 1900.  Fuel loads build ever higher and dangers rise.  We can soon expect huge, destructive fires rather than many small, natural ones.</P>

<P>Making park budgets dependent on politics rather than the parks' net revenues also distorts decisions and encourages bureaucratic inefficiencies. Park Service construction budgets routinely include 50% extra for overhead and overruns.  Parks' user fees and concessionaire fees go to Washington.  The resulting underpriced or free access encourages overuse of our parks.  Increasingly, the park system is characterized by low quality new parks and degraded old ones.</P>

<P>Supporters of legislation now before Congress believe corporate sponsorship of national parks holds the solution.  The proposal's main stumbling block is public apprehension about commercialization of our parks.  It's understandable that, as the Olympics draw near, we guard against &quot;Disney-fied&quot; parks, like a Timex Old Faithful or a Ranier Beer Ranier National Park.  </P>

<P>How do we guard against such crass commercialization?  Endowment boards, with their membership, drawn from environmental, community, business, and science leaders have incentives to seek subtle, tasteful sponsorship and public support.  If trustees fail to honor a binding mandate to foster values specific to each park, then they suffer reputational and other losses.</P>

<P>As with other environmnetal issues, we face trade-offs not perfect solutions.  Even cynical observers note that the threat of commercialization is less serious than the current slide in services and sustainability.  Independence Hall is in desperate need of roof repairs and modern fire sprinklers.  Should we let 20th Century Fox put &quot;Official Sponsor of Independence Hall National Park&quot; on its &quot;Independence Day&quot; movie billboards?   What if the alternative is to let this park go up in smoke?</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship could make a huge difference.  Ford Motor Company recently purchased 20 pages in Newsweek dedicated to the national park system.  Ten were Ford ads, ten were travel brochures for various national parks like Crater Lake and Big Bend.  The ad space alone cost around $1.5 million. While pocket change to Ford, this sum equals the operating budget of the average U.S. National Park.</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship of the national park system is part of a larger movement to separate Park Service funding from Congress.  Only when park budgets are depoliticized will America have a vibrant and long-lasting park system.  Creating mechanisms for collecting payment from various park beneficiaries is an important step in this direction.  User fees, gifts from membership organizations, concessionaire contracts, and corporate sponsorships all have potential.  Instituting endowment boards to generate and manage these funds will foster the necessary trust, sensitivity, and responsibility.</P>

<P>National parks are failing to deliver the quality or stability park-lovers demand.  Support and management of our national heritage must come from the people who appreciate and benefit from those parks.  When parks must pay their own way through fees and friends, we'll see more responsible stewardship.  The parks are too precious for a precarious dependency on politics.</P>

In later columns, I will discuss the likely economic and environmental consequences of a ban.</P><P>       Government exists to promote harmony and foster prosperity. These goals are hard to attain if political power is used to strip some people of their property to benefit others. Such actions eventually hurt everyone for they erode the foundations of a free society. When property is taken for legitimate public purposes, owners should be compensated for their losses. This is not to happen if private tree farms are prohibited from selling logs abroad. The prohibition surely feels like plunder to those who may suffer it.</P><P>     Protection from political coercion must remain our paramount concern even if raw log exports cost a significant number of Northwest jobs, a far from certain outcome. Liberals and conservatives who understand the social value of the market process understand this. A productive and cooperative social order requires property rights that are secure from arbitrary seizure or reduction in value. Even if a ban on the export of private timber would save jobs, the process it legitimizes leads to increasing conflict and to ethical erosion in relationships among citizens.</P><P>     Some politicians face strong incentives to prohibit timber owners from selling their logs to foreigners. They seek political gain by playing on people's fears that global commerce means the loss of jobs and security. Politicians flirt with a destructive game when they try to generate campaign contributions and electoral support by favoring one group or person at another's expense. Yet, average citizens remain unaware of the unintended consequences of these actions.</P><P>     Opportunistic behavior, not compassion, explains the export ban. This is no accident. In politics, duplicity accompanies opportunism and honorable behavior is a severe liability. Honorable politicians are like vegetarian coyotes in that they face a great handicap when competing with their red-meat opponents.</P><P>     Although many of us are disgusted with pork-barrel politics, we often reward our representatives with re-election when they secure our pork. Congress loses respect but our representative is well-regarded. It is easy to rationalize socially destructive behavior by someone we know well. People often see their representative as a good person who must compete in an institution where principles are a liability. The institution brings out their worst and causes many to flee national politics.</P><P>     Everyone has good reason to oppose political opportunism. The reason is simple: Politicians who will steal for you will also steal from you. History shows that politicians are rarely bought, but often rented until someone is willing to pay more. This is why it is so important to reward politicians who are true to their principles. (And why so many of us are offended by the hypocrisy of &quot;conservatives&quot; who advocate governmental subsidies for the rich.) When government can arbitrarily constrain property rights and freedom to trade on our own terms, no one is safe. Even if intentions are pure and ends legitimate (e.g., saving jobs), relying on coercion to impose an uncompensated loss is neither ethical nor wise.</P><P>     In economics as in ecology, we can never do just one thing. We cannot predict the mischief that will arise to confound our intentions when we use politics to generate private benefits for one by taking from another, e.g., taking markets from owners of private timber. The more government becomes the granter of special opportunities and special privileges, the more people will seek them from government. And they always come at others' expense.</P><P>     An export ban may preserve jobs in timber processing while destroying those in shipping. It may even harm Northwest mill workers as disinvestment occurs and private timber investment shifts to the Southeast and abroad. More generally, we create an environment in which no one's property, income, or job is safe when we legitimize transferring resources among citizens by stripping or attenuating the property rights of one group to benefit another. We create the Founding Fathers' nightmare: a political economy of plunder.</P><P>     When constitutional protections of individual rights and limits on government power are respected, they serve us admirably. These protections - embodied in the takings, contract and commerce clauses, provisions for impartial trials, and the safeguards in the Bill of Rights and later amendments - are designed to shield us from the predations of government. The U.S. Constitution was designed to foster a political economy of justice with respect for other's possessions. Society becomes less civil and less productive when we stray from this design.</P><P>     The ban on log exports would cause economic and environmental harm. This is important and I'll discuss these problems in my next column. But most of all, the ban violates fundamental ethical principles that underlie our Constitution and our nation. Arbitrarily taking something of value from one group and giving it to another can only undermine liberty and security. The export ban may be good short-term politics but it is pregnant with mischief.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Ill-conceived federal price controls and OPEC's last successful petroleum embargo combined to create an emergency. The results were disastrous, the predictable consequence of policies that disrupt the market process and favor special interests  </P><P>      In response to this &quot;crisis,&quot; Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, commonly referred to as PURPA. Designed to spur research into &quot;alternative&quot; energy sources, this law produced several unintended consequences including higher energy prices for the consumer.</P><P>Resource Data International, Inc., a Boulder, Colo., consulting firm, estimates the PURPA will cost consumers up to $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, in direct subsidies and also in &quot;deadweight&quot; losses from overcapacity. The PURPA fiasco provides an expensive lesson in what happens when regulators ignore the market's signals. Efficiency, innovation and conservation become casualties of politics.</P><P>PURPA's creators should have been familiar with the law of unintended consequences, for this legislation was designed to address some of the unforeseen results of the Depression-era Rural Electrification Administration (REA). Despite the merits of rural electrification - and they are numerous and significant - governmental policies imposed unanticipated costs. Specifically, subsidies for capital-intensive, coal- and oil-fired electricity inhibited research into and development of alternative energy sources. Hence, from the mid-1930s until the late 1970s there was a hiatus of research in renewable energy.</P><P>     Many people are surprised to learn that serious interest in renewable energy began in the late 1800s. Before the REA, the high cost of stringing power lines to remote areas made wind, solar and small hydroelectric technologies highly attractive. The profit motive encouraged entrepreneurship. The REA and its subsidies to centrally generated power and rural electrification undermined money-making opportunities, and research into renewable energy evaporated.</P><P>     Something is amiss when the government creates a problem, then 40 years later claims that government action is necessary to correct the problem, yet this is precisely what happened in 1978. Proponents of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act couched their rhetoric in national-security terms. PURPA was to compensate for the absence of research into renewable energy sources.</P><P>     My colleague at Montana State, Richard Stroup, and I were concerned about this back in 1979. Writing about the lack of research and development in renewable energy, we wrote:</P><P>      &quot;Our current retarded position, caused largely by subsidies, has led to arguments that we should not subsidize the development of alternative energy systems. But clearly there is a problem with subsidies. Specifically, a subsidy inhibits developments in areas not subsidized. Since the future is uncertain we cannot know what the cost of our bias will be. We can only know that there will be a cost.&quot;</P><P>      When governments distort market signals, problems follow. Government subsidies of the 1930s caused a sharp decline in research and development of alternative energy sources. Price controls in the 1970s produced long lines at the gas pumps and reduced incentives to find greater energy efficiency.</P><P>The cost of subsidizing renewable energy sources is at least $200 billion between now and the turn of the century, and consumers are the ones who end up paying. In addition to granting direct subsidies for renewable energy, PURPA required public utilities to purchase the power generated by these sources - solar, wind and &quot;waste-to-energy&quot; - at prices far above the market price. Renewable energy now sells for up to 16 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Even in Hawaii and Alaska, where energy prices are among the highest in the country, the Edison Electric Institute estimates that energy costs from all sources range from 7 to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, far below the break-even point for renewable energy.</P><P>     Subsidies and guaranteed prices had the predictable result. We now have power plants that lie idle, built by tax-deferred municipal bonds and then abandoned because the plants can not cover their operating costs. Some operate far below capacity and are in disrepair because, as in pre-1989 Eastern Bloc energy production, the revenues from the additional capacity would not cover the repairs.</P><P>     One of the sorriest examples is the Altamont Pass windfarm just east of San Francisco. Not only does its electricity cost 11 cents a kilowatt hour to produce but the unsightly windmills kill birds; in the past two years some 500 raptors - including 78 golden eagles - have been sucked into the blades. PURPA even gave rise to the world's only commercial-scale manure-fired power plant. Power from this plant cost eight times the market price to produce, and the plant operators had trouble keeping the fuel lit. Recent floods finally accomplished what the market was prevented from doing and shut down the plant.</P><P>     No firm fully accountable for its costs would persist with such schemes. REA, PURPA, and energy price controls force us to pay twice for errors in political judgment. First, as taxpayers, since our taxes fund these subsidies, and second, as ratepayers, since utilities pass high-priced energy costs on to the consumer. Altamont Pass and the manure-fired power plant in El Centro, Calif., are illustrative examples of an important truth: Government efforts to direct innovation and promote particular outcomes have unintended and often pernicious consequences.</P><P>     Free markets and free prices help entrepreneurs and investors sift through the cow manure. We should remember the lessons of history as we consider how to promote conservation and efficiency in our energy future. </P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

BADEN</P><P>           KILLING WOLVES is a dramatic and highly controversial wildlife management practice. Alaska has recently proposed this as a way to boost caribou, moose, and deer populations for tourists and hunters.</P><P> But many people find gunning wolves from airplanes offensive and are outraged.</P><P>     The logic underlying the killing seems clear, but the issues are complex. Wolves do kill caribou, elk and moose - especially their young. Reducing wolf populations should increase the numbers of these ungulates, but by how much? There are bitter disputes among scientists over the size of predator impact upon prey populations.</P><P>     According to Dr. Fred Wagner, Director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, wildlife managers see three options:</P><P>       --  First, with no controls, predators and prey will reach a long-run equilibrium with low numbers of both.</P><P>     --  A second option - elimination of predators - allows herds to rise dramatically in the short term, but in the long run small populations result from degraded habitat.</P><P>     --  The third way is to moderately decrease predator numbers, providing a sustainable rise in ungulate populations. Alaska seems to follow this third, moderate control option, thereby enhancing big-game hunting.</P><P>     But the link between predator and prey is questioned by some scientists. They contend that herbivore numbers are primarily determined by habitat, that predators play only a marginal role in determining numbers of caribou, moose and elk. Only renewed habitat, such as that created by fire, can significantly increase populations. And regardless, they say, accurately determining the &quot;optimal&quot; wolf populations is hard to achieve.</P><P>     What precedents do we have for wolf-control programs?</P><P>       Yellowstone Park is a prime, if discouraging example. Wolves were deliberately eliminated from the Yellowstone ecosystem decades ago. Like most well-intentioned interventions in ecological and economic systems, the results have been different and more severe than anticipated.</P><P>     Elk populations in the Park have erupted, causing massive over-grazing and the prospect of mass starvation during severe Rocky Mountain winters. Whole plant and animal species have been decimated, drastically changing the park's ecology. What will be the results in the delicate Arctic tundra?</P><P>       Wolf controls have been tried in Alaska but without great success; bears, not wolves, were found to be taking the largest share of ungulates. So wolf numbers may, or may not, significantly impact prey numbers in Alaska.</P><P>     And as Dr. Kenneth Raedeke, a wildlife specialist at the University of Washington observes, &quot;having a brown bear control program, even in Alaska, is not (politically) acceptable.&quot; This gets to the heart of the matter: the nature of political decision-making. The decision to control wolf populations was made on the basis of political power, not science, economic efficiency or environmental sensitivity. Wolves, apparently, are thought to be politically acceptable targets while bears are not.</P><P>     In Alaska, Gov. Walter Hickel and special-interest groups such as the Alaska Outdoor Council, a coalition of outfitters, hunters</P><P> and bush pilots, have used the levers of political control over natural resources to their advantage, regardless of ecological effects. They want to make it easier for hunters to kill moose and caribou by increasing their populations, even though, as the director of Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation admits, &quot;there are no real shortages of big-game animals in Alaska.&quot; This is the predictable result of bureaucratic management in a political environment.</P><P>     As public-choice economics teaches, more than ecological concerns are being sacrificed to special interests.</P><P>     The consequences, while clear for the wolves, may be equally bleak for Alaska's reputation for its important tourist economy. The state has already received &quot;hundred of letters&quot; protesting the plan. Last week, the National Parks and Conservation Association canceled its 75th anniversary board meeting scheduled for Anchorage. A decline in tourism may match the decrease in wolf population.</P><P>     By responding to a small, vocal constituency, Alaska's government may have damaged a far broader, but less-well-organized and focused group. This decision once again illustrates the pitfalls of political-bureaucratic natural resource management, where special interests can run the decision-making apparatus to their benefit while ignoring the costs imposed on many.</P><P>     The Alaskan wolf example demonstrates that sound environmentalism must recognize the dangers of political management. In a greener political economy, environmental management should be guided by science and constrained by economic realities. We can learn from Alaska. </P>

BADEN</P><P>           THE Shoshone National Forest near Dubois, Wyo., is an important part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. But the forest has maintained a money-losing logging program. In any rational system, the ecological, recreation, watershed and wildlife values would easily trump logging in the Shoshone.</P><P>       Even the purely economic cost of logging the Shoshone exceed the benefits. In 1991, for example, the Forest Service lost $557,000 on the Shoshone while selling 13,000,000 board feet of timber. If we include road and other associated costs, some of which the Forest Service ignores entirely, the losses go up to $1,857,000. Since timber likes to grow where it's warm, wet and low, and the Shoshone is high, dry and cold, these losses cannot be corrected by more efficient management. Rather, fundamental reform is in order. A recent event inspires such reform.</P><P>       Stephen Gordon ranches near the Shoshone and grazes cattle on its lands. He recently sent the Forest Service a $100,000 check as a down payment for rights to a timber sale in the Shoshone's Brent Creek drainage. But with rights to the timber he would keep it standing, not cut it. He pledged an additional $200,000 and agreed to replenish his federal grazing permits in favor of wildlife. Further, to benefit wildlife habitat, he offered to donate a conservation easement on his ranch to the government. All this if only the Forest Service would agree to forgo a money-losing sale.</P><P>     Both the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service urged the Forest Service not to cut the drainage, saying that it is a critical migration corridor for elk and important to the Yellowstone grizzly population.</P><P>     But the Forest Service returned Gordon's check. It did not offer an economic rationale for rejecting his offer. Nor did it dispute that the area was critical wildlife habitat. District Ranger Brent Larson replied that Gordon proposed &quot;creation of a de facto wilderness area. We can't do that.&quot; The Forest Service saw their multiple-use mission as requiring that they provide logs to local mills even when other values are much higher.</P><P>     The Forest Service budget is increased when it interprets multiple use as a mandate to lose money and sacrifice habitat. It has become a parasitic bureaucracy. Its arcane budgeting and decision-making process are governed by a political calculus that dominates economic and ecological standards.</P><P>     Can we imagine new institutional arrangements that are sensitive to changing values and open to scientific findings? Could we design an organization that would responsibly weigh the costs and benefits of alternative actions? Can we accommodate offers like Gordon's?</P><P>       When dealing with political economy, we should separate hopes from expectations. With this cautionary note, I propose that we build upon our centuries of common-law experience and create a Shoshone Biodiversity Trust. Like a museum, nonprofit hospital or private college, the trust would be run by a board of trustees, respected and knowledgeable volunteers who accept fiduciary responsibility. The trust's sole purpose would be to manage the former national forest land, land that did not support a viable timber industry but was logged at a loss due to political pressures.</P><P>     Environmental scientists and local, regional and national leaders could comprise the board. The trust would be granted a charter by Congress and would have to act within the confines of this charter, obeying previously established wilderness designations and protecting proscribed riparian areas. Beyond that, it would be free to set its own course.</P><P>     Each forest endowment board would run solely on its own revenues. No more federal handouts. Each would have access to a full array of income-generating mechanisms: grazing permits, recreation fees, gifts and even timber sales where they made economic and ecological sense. The board would return 25 percent of revenue from recreation or commodities to counties and local communities, just as the Forest Service now does.</P><P>       The remainder could be used in any way that furthered the trust's mission. It could study wildlife populations, maintain trails, buy more land or buy winter range for wildlife. If this experiment is successful it may be replicated on other forests. Some would likely promote intensive recreation uses, such as mountain biking, while others might focus on primitive recreation and wilderness areas.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship exists in the nonprofit as well as the for-profit world, The Nature Conservancy and the North American Elk Foundation are highly successful examples. These organizations creatively respond to new interests and understandings. A Shoshone Biodiversity Trust can follow their lead. With such trusts we can better preserve shared values, allowing each forest to fulfill its mission and maintain its ecological endowment.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

<TITLE>Politicians and Parks Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>1/18/95</P><H1><P>Keep politicians from ruining our parks</P></H1> <P>          THE idea of national parks is one of America's best. Approval ratings exceed 90 percent. But political federal management of the parks is a terrible idea. Politics promotes ecological destruction and ethical corruption</P><P>       Two recent books, &quot;Playing God in Yellowstone&quot; and &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park,&quot; publicize what experts have known for years: our parks' long-term ecological health is seriously threatened.</P><P>     One problem is severe elk overpopulation. Elk in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks far exceed the number the parks can sustain. There are 40,000-50,000 elk in the Yellowstone area, though it is the 20,000 elk inhabiting the northern range and wintering in the park that are the main problem. The burgeoning elk population is rapidly destroying aspen, cottonwood and willow stands and various grasses. Erosion is increasing and vegetative diversity is falling. Antelope, bighorn sheep, moose, mountain lions, ptarmigans, and beaver are among the victims.</P><P>     Why does the Park Service permit elk to degrade the land and ecology in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain? The answer is politics. Until 1967 (1961 in Rocky Mountain), the Park Service culled herds with government hunters. With natural predators and hunting by native Americans virtually eliminated, historic range severely reduced, and relocation no longer an option, slaughtering elk was the only responsible action.</P><P>     But the public sees elk as cute and fuzzy charismatic megafauna that shouldn't be shot. Because the Park Service and its congressional overseers are sensitive to voter pressure, the elk population is exploding even as ecology, land quality and species diversity degrade.</P><P>     Absence of fire is the second problem. Both Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain are fire-driven ecosystems. Fire is crucial for rejuvenating stagnant climax forests because it stimulates the growth of diverse succession species such as aspen and various grasses, shrubs and wildflowers. Lack of fire, particularly in Rocky Mountain, is destroying these species and the animals that depend on them. Before white men imposed a fire-control regime, low-level surface fires cleared away accumulated undergrowth while leaving most mature and healthy trees alive.</P><P>     Ecological vitality is fostered by regular, small-scale burns. But once again, political pressure has made such burns difficult to tolerate, let alone create. Residents of nearby towns dislike smoke and haze from fires. Even controlled fire annoys tourists. And fires may escalate out of control.</P><P>     Ultimately, as fuel accumulates, large fires are inevitable. Without the natural firebreaks created by less severe, more frequent burns and with the huge buildup in deadwood and other fuel (up to 100 tons/acre), a dry year may bring another fire such as that which burned 1.2 million acres of Yellowstone in 1988.</P><P>     Perversely, fires actually help the Park Service. The Park Service is rewarded for uncontrolled fires because Congress grants blank checks for fire fighting. Besides, fighting fires is macho and romantic. As a smoke jumper friend said: &quot;Fires are great! It's just like war but no one shoots back!&quot;</P><P>       Dr. Fred Wagner, director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, notes another reason why destructive elk- and fire-management policies have continued: The people best qualified to criticize have been co-opted by the Park Service. Park Service scientists are well aware of an important ecological principle: Don't bite the hand that feeds you. In a 1989 paper, Wagner notes a recurring theme among researchers working with the parks. They say &quot;Yes, I have some misgivings about what is going on in the parks, but I'm getting research funds from them and I'm not going to rock the boat.&quot; The consequence of this self-censorship is poorly informed policy.</P><P>     To end the ecological damage of political management, we should consider alternative arrangements for park management. Public but nongovernment endowment boards operating under the common law doctrine of &quot;trust&quot; hold great promise. Everyone is familiar with institutions managed by endowment boards: nongovernment schools, nonprofit hospitals and museums are common examples.</P><P>     Each park would have an endowment board. It could be chartered with the legally binding mandate of fostering the values that justified creating that park, e.g. wilderness, waterfowl or wonders. Established environmental groups, local communities and business leaders would nominate people to the board. Each person would be confirmed by Congress, and each park given a modest, one-time-only financial endowment. Free from political interference, the trustees would have responsibility for managing that park in accord with its charter.</P><P>     An endowment board would solicit donations and charge fees just as a museum does. The board would have strong incentives to allow ecologically sensitive commercial activities, as we find on Audubon Society preserves and Nature Conservancy land. In rare cases, some extractive activities would be permitted, but only if they</P><P> complement our national parks' highest values of scenery, preservation and recreation.</P><P>     Freeing the parks from politics is essential to preserving their ecological and cultural legacy. We've had more than 600 years of experience with trusts. By making park managers accountable to a stable board of trustees rather than elected politicians with transient interests, they would be forced to confront the real, long-term consequences of their actions. Freed from the pressures of special interests, humans and nature could seek responsible balance.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

<H1>Environmentalism Needs A Free Press</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The First Amendment of the Constitution safeguards that most essential feature of democracy: the liberty to communicate ideas and advocate alternatives to the status quo.  It protects freedom of the press, speech, assembly, and religion.  It guarantees our right to complain to and about the government.  
</P>
<P>
Environmental advocates use these freedoms to champion reform.  <A HREF="http://www.greenpeace.org/">Greenpeace </A> has taken the right to assemble to an artform in their protests and demonstrations.  The litigious <A HREF="http://www.nrdc.org/nrdc">Natural Resources Defense Council</A> and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund flourish with lawsuits against lethargic or misguided government agencies.  The paganism of <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/orgs/ef/">Earth First!</A> depends on freedom of religious expression.  Vibrant environmentalism requires free press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
But environmental advocacy prompts censorship by government agencies and private interests.  On the "left coast" this fall, two Eugene <CITE>Register-Guard</CITE> employees were arrested and their notebook, comeras, and film confiscated after the <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</A> closed the Warner Creek salvage timber sale site amid vocal protests by environmentalists.  According to managing editor Jim Godbold, "We think the issues raised by the arrest and confiscation of our material at Warner Creek are serious enough injuries to the First Amendment that they deserve to be heard in a federal courtroom."
</P>

<P>
The Forest Service is notoriously heavy-handed with its censorship, manipulation, and denial of information.  USFS forester Jeff DeBonis created <A HREF="http://www.afseee.org/">AFSEEE</A> (The Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics) in response to repeated Forest Service suppression of information.
</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</A> likewise censors and impedes outside investigations.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> recounts obstruction, inexplicable omissions, and other chicanery on the part of the Park Service.  It took a court order to force the Yellowstone Institute, an "independent" organization chaired by the then-president of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu/">Montana State University</A>, to add this challenging book to the visitor centers' publications.  Those advantaged by the status quo colluded to hide it.
</P>

<P>
Honest assessments are difficult to come by because, as Chase says, "The usual fate of whistleblowers kept many officials silent, and the threat of losing their prerogative to study in Yellowstone frequently inhibited university scholars."  That's exactly what happened to Professors John and Frank Craighead.  Before their highly critical research could be completed, the world's grizzly experts' Yellowstone cabin, with all their data, mysteriously burned down.
</P>

<P>
The need to protect whistleblowers is not limited to public lands agencies.  In June of 1996 the Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving landfill user fees, that independent government contractors, like government employees, are "protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory action" for failing to follow the agency's "party line".  According to Justice O'Conner, "[The threat of retaliation against contractors] may chill speech on matters of public concern by those who, because of their dealings with the government, are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work."  Threats to environmental whistleblowers are widespread.
</P>

<P>
Take the case of Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/">Washington State University</A>.  After he testified against expanding the subsidies of the Columbia Basin Project, State Senator Tub Hansen reportedly met with the dean of the School of Agriculture to have Whittlesey's tenured position eliminated.  When that failed, Hansen then tried to make Whittlesey's salary as a line item in the state budget so it could be eliminated in committee.  Speaking truth to power is hazardous duty.
</P>

<P>
In popular press, we can also see political interests shackling free speech.  <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A> environmental reporter Keith Schneider was among the most prominent writers to be removed from his post for honest reporting.  He bucked the envrionmentalist orthodoxy by writing about trade-offs to environmental regulations and cleanup, and quickly found himself out of work.
</P>

<P>
And then there is Gregg Easterbrook, author of <CITE>A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism</CITE>.  He notes that his personal popularity plummetted after publishing the book:  "My book was blistered by enviro lobbies....  Wham!  I had hit the Al Gore glass ceiling."
</P>

<P>
Another "green-listed" author was Tom Wicker, a <CITE>New York Times</CITE> columnist.  Last February, John Flicker, head of the <A HREF="http://www.audubon.org/audubon/">National Audubon Society</A>, demanded that Wicker's article be pulled from the Society's <CITE> Audubon</CITE> magazine because it criticized the Clinton Administration.
</P>

<P>
Protecting First Amendment rights empowers environmental reform.  When federal agencies control information, abuses of authority often follow.  Environmental orthodoxy and bureaucratic expediency often trump honest and free reporting.  
</P>

<P>
If the environmental movement is to motivate innovative and scientifically sound reform, we must encourage dissenters to speak and be vigilant in keeping government agencies from controlling information.  
</P>

<P>
The alternative is to quietly slip towards an Orwellian nightmare with government as the "Ministry of Truth".  Too melodramatic?  Take a look the California EPA's recent "record retention policy":
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>Please dispose of all documents... [electronic mail] messages and other communications prepared during the course of policy formulation which contain other policy proposals not adopted or reflected in the final decision.</CODE>

Baden</P><P>THE University of Washington has just suffered a $12 million budget cut. Political pressures within the university are to spread the pain by giving each college and program a proportional cut. With each unit suffering, say, a 2.4 percent reduction, no one has a strong incentive to mobilize to protect their special, provincial interest.</P><P>       Such caving-in minimizes short-run pain but gradually erodes quality. To avoid this erosion, hard choices must be made. It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible to pretend these choices away and wait for better times, perhaps after the next president is appointed. While there's no unambiguously happy ending, at least we'll have a better reading of people's character as the process unfolds.</P><P>     Our budgetary shortfall is neither transitory nor local. Universities' golden age has passed, but our expectations lag reality. As David Goodstein, vice provost at Caltech noted, universities are on the threshold of &quot;the permanent era of constraint.&quot; Federal and state governments are reducing aid. They have tight budgets and electorates resist further tax increases. After years of tuition growth, some falling enrollments, and the expenses of increasing diversity, many schools cannot maintain current budgets of existing programs. This is most evident in California but these pressures are nationwide.</P><P>     Like other large complex organizations, units within universities are often run with an eye toward the benefits of those in them, not only for their stated purpose. When tough decisions are being made, we should expect the affected faculty and administrators to carefully weigh the expected impact of those decisions on their own well-being. These considerations of self interest often trump both the social value of their programs and the interests of students in general. Given human nature, it will not be otherwise.</P><P>     Hence, when universities face cutbacks, an adverse selection process goes to work. And here's the unhappy result: Those with the sorriest prospects on the outside (or at other universities) have the greatest incentive to keep their present positions. University politics often get especially nasty as projected losers attempt to discredit the university's leadership. An important principle of political economy becomes evident - last guys don't finish nice.</P><P>     A Ph.D. does not grant immunity from the labor market. Unless protected from market forces, by tenure for example, professors are usually paid an amount roughly equal to their value outside. This is why the salaries in medical schools are substantially higher than those in medieval studies, higher in computer science than in classics, higher in economics than in ecology. Some are paid less than their social contribution, and many find this unfair, but this is how the world works.</P><P>     It doesn't require training in economics to understand this process. Those with poor options elsewhere will fight the hardest to maintain their positions. They argue that the pain should be shared equally and programs spared. They find many arguments why their program should be saved and they mobilize pressures to retain their existing budget share. Given the stakes, it would be naive to expect any other behavior.</P><P>     But not all resistance is self-serving. We face the classic elements of tragedy when legitimate values collide and people face competing, inconsistent obligations. Some people in programs slated for elimination are no doubt highly dedicated and competent. Most will sincerely believe that their program is more valuable to the university stakeholders than some others being retained. And in these terribly important cases, there is no clear and objective standard of evaluation.</P><P>     This is not an easy time to be the president of a great university. Cuts cannot be avoided. Because of rigidities and scale requirements, the responsible decision is to cut marginal programs out entirely. The pressures are to share the pain and keep all alive but on short rations. The universities that remain in the top tier will focus their resources on the high-quality programs. The president has the responsibility to take the grand view and maximize quality.</P><P>     Only in Lake Wobegon are all departments and programs above average. Every large first-rate university has some second- or third-rate departments, schools and programs. When crunch time comes, they should go. This is the most intellectually and ethically responsible policy. Good leaders of great universities must select by quality and contribution to excellence. Since we can't have everything, we should resist political pressures and keep the best and most valuable. It requires great character, intelligence and judgment to do this. The demonstration of such qualities is the positive feature of the classic tragedies.</P><P>     William Gerberding, president of UW, was courageous when he announced a cut of faculty and departments. For the long-run future of a great university, Gerberding made the right decision. The question is, will he be able to implement it?</P><P>       When a drought hits and feed gets short, the rancher can choose from two strategies: put all stock on short rations, or as my grandfather would say, &quot;It's time to put wheels under the poor cows and take them to market.&quot; He knew that herd quality would suffer if we didn't cull now. University presidents face the same reality.</P><P>_____________</P><P>  John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>4/3/96</P><H1>Thirst for Private Water Suppliers Grows</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>Water is precious to life on earth.  Healthy organisms, ecosystems, and weather cycles depend on it.  A sufficient supply of clean water is the critical first step to improving public health in every society.   Just because everyone needs water, however, doesn't make managing it easy.  Developing countries are struggling for water.  The <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</A> says $600 billion is needed in the next decade to avoid water shortages.</P>

<P>Even though Earth is mostly water, only about 1% of it is available freshwater.  And with global water consumption tripling since 1950, some claim it's only a matter of time before the strain on  the world's water supply becomes too great:  29 years according to Paul Ehrlich, Sandra Postel, and Gretchen Daily.  If you live where the Colorado River used to drain into the sea, or where the Aral Sea once existed, the time may already be now.  How we manage scarce water resources is increasingly vital, for public health as well as the health of wetlands, salmon runs, and other ecosystems.  That makes water delivery systems among the most important enterprises.</P>

<P>America's water management ideology flowed from the Progressive Era doctrine of a century ago.  Political leaders used tax-exempt government bonds to fund facilities and enabled bureaucracies to provide their burgeoning cities with water. As a result, 85% of Americans drink water from government-owned companies.  Public water companies, they thought, could easily, efficiently, and reliably supply municipal water.</P>

<P>The Progressives were wrong.  Time, and a recent study of California's water industry by the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, has proven them wrong.  The Reason Foundation surveyed private and public water companies in California and discovered that both offered comparable services.  To provide those same water services, however, the government-owned companies relied on tax exemptions and subsidies.</P>

<P>The private companies fended for themselves, and did so more efficiently.  Their water cost consumers only three-fourths that of public water.  Inefficiencies of government-owned water companies go beyond cost to consumers.  Their operating expenses per connection were 21% higher.  They required more than double the number of employees per connection.  Accordingly, salaries of public water companies ate up almost three times as much of the operating revenue as the private companies.  Public companies also spent nearly double their private counterparts on maintenance.</P>

<P>The good news for Californians is that even their wasteful government water companies are more efficient than some third-world water companies.  Most Latin American utilities require between ten and twenty employees per thousand connections (compared with 1.62 for private- and 3.49 for government-owned firms in Calif.).  No wonder that developing countries which are dominated by government-owned water industries &quot;require&quot; massive bailouts.  No wonder the specter of water shortages looms so closely.</P>

<P>The bad news is that 78% of Californians receive their water from wasteful public authorities.  The <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> finds that subsidizing public water passes no savings on to the consumer.  The subisidized inefficiencies effectively flush public funds that could instead be spent on more worthwhile undertakings or reduced taxes.</P>

<P>Public water companies are protected from competition.  Bloated payrolls, extravagant expenditures, and addiction to subsidized capital characterize government water works.  Government-owned agencies in California notoriously accumulated large cash and investment incomes.  The Irvine Ranch Water District, for example, invested $32.5 million in an apartment complex and another $12 million in two other real estate developments.  Allowing government agencies like water companies to speculate with public money leads to the financial nightmare that vexes Orange County today.</P>

<P>Privatization presents an attractive alternative in the U.S. and elsewhere.  England privatized its water industry in 1989.  French cities has been contracting their water systems since the 19th century.  Some international firms found great success in supplying water to developing nations badly in need of competent and competitive water systems.  In Buenos Aires, the government water authority was so inept that privatizing offered huge benefits.  Privatization has brought $4 billion in infrastructure investment, improved government pipelines that previously leaked half of their water, and resolved the chronic summer  water shortages.  This approach conserves the environment while promoting healthier and wealthier consumers in Brazil.</P>

<P>In America, municipal budgets are tightening.  Mayors increasingly seek new capital.  And proliferating environmental regulations make the water business ever more difficult for city bueaucracies.  These factors make change certain.  Privatization of much of the water industry is likely.  </P>

<P>Ironically, public water companies were intended to protect the sacred municipal water supply.  What really happens in socialized water systems, however, is something quite different.  Water and other resources are wasted and public health is at risk while political interests are protected.  Now, as Mr. Clinton claims the &quot;era of big government is over,&quot; we can find support for innovative ways to provide public goods.  It takes courage to overcome the outmoded Progressive thinking.  Fortunately, thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and others, the common sense to see the benefits of privatization is becoming more common. </P>

BADEN</P><P>            I HAVE long held a vision of what a good society would include. Its most important elements are liberty, environmental quality and communities of people who value both. But only certain institutional arrangements foster these ends. History is unlikely to show that yesterday's election moved us toward these goals.</P><P>       But elections do cause thoughtful people to carefully separate their hopes from their expectations. We hope that people will weigh the public interest more heavily than their narrow self interest. However, elections usually teach us to expect concentrated interests to prevail and government to grow.</P><P>     Organized interests solidify their gains by creating institutions and agencies. With these in place, even modest reforms become difficult to enact. We see this in the protracted efforts to increase the price of grazing federal lands. For grazing on our family's Montana ranch we charge more than $10 per cow and calf per month. On federal land near ours, permit holders such as Metropolitan Life Insurance pay $1.85 for their Forest Service and BLM grass.</P><P>     This is a predictable consequence of political allocation. We would surely be far better off if the grazing rights recognized the value of wildlife habitat and were freely exchangeable on the open market. But today's political incentives work against such rational outcomes. This is just one example of a program that violates reasonable standards of economic efficiency, ecological sensitivity and social equity.</P><P>     America's founders understood that when governments control large sectors of an economy, governance becomes an exercise in relatively peaceful, although involuntary, wealth transfers. Stealth and duplicity are great assets in this game. It often takes great skill and dedication to discover these transfers.</P><P>     But the benefits of reform are widely diffused. No individual has an economic incentive to advocate reform as strongly as the beneficiaries do to preserve existing institutions. Large permit holders such as Metropolitan Life have more to gain from their subsidies than any single one of us will gain by fighting them. Today, only the congenital do-gooder has incentives to expose the waste and inequities of political mischief. I propose a modest reform: Let's create a Predatory Bureaucracy.</P><P>     The logic is simple and straightforward. It is part of the convergence developing between ecological and economic theory. Essentially, the predatory bureau would receive a small percentage of any budgetary proposal offered by an agency. Here's an outline of the process I initially envisioned.</P><P>     For most of us the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries a crust of derision. Rigidity, inflexibility, insensitivity and persistence are their defining characteristics. However good our intentions in creating an agency, its budgetary imperatives ultimately lead it to stray from these goals. Over the long haul, bureaucracies are usually run for the convenience of its leaders and the clientele on whom they depend for political support. For those of us wanting reform, our design problem is to link this persistent tendency with the public interest. The predatory bureaucracy does so.</P><P>     We can learn a lot from a relatively successful example. The U.S. Post Office is closely and consistently monitored and faces increasing competition from Federal Express, fax, etc. Despite our complaining, the Post Office actually does quite well because it faces the kind of feedback we expect in the market. What can we do about agencies that do not have these checks on their performance? Here is where our &quot;predatory bureau&quot; can help advance the public interest.</P><P>     A predatory bureaucracy survives only by preying upon other bureaucracies' budgets. Like coyotes to rabbits and wolves to elk, it will eliminate many vulnerable programs.</P><P>     The basic idea is simple enough to write into a state initiative. We should create an agency whose income will only come preying upon the specific program budgets of other agencies. Suppose an agency proposes a new program, or seeks to continue an obsolete one. Our predatory agency may challenge this proposal. It will use the press, interest groups and other political avenues.</P><P>     Unlike most of us, this agency has a vital interest in defeating a wasteful idea because (unlike most agencies) it only gets funding from its successes. If the other agency's proposal loses, it receives 1 percent of the defeated agency's budget proposal. And the defeated agency loses that 1 percent and gets a proportional amount taken from its operating budget.</P><P>     After an initial two-years' funding, this agency will cost taxpayers nothing. Its income comes only from other agencies. Because all agencies will begin to act more wisely, on pain of being attacked by our predator, enormous amounts of tax money will be saved due to weak programs not being proposed.</P><P>     Incorporating a predatory bureaucracy into government may do more than elections to control government waste. It's a way to harmonize the public interest with the self-interest of experts in the political process. Let's consider this idea while waiting for next November.</P><P>_________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           JAMES Watt, Ronald Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, was an environmental paradox. To environmentalists, he personified an obsolete view of nature, a view seeing only commercial value in natural resources. But for the Greens, Watt was a useful icon of rapacious industrial exploitation. As such, he deserves much of the credit for the rise of professional environmentalism. He was the enemy that united their followers. He fueled massive fund-raising campaigns to thwart the Reagan Administration's policy directives.</P><P>       As an unapologetic voice for industry, Vice President Dan Quayle is a pale incarnation of James Watt. Quayle, who runs the White House Council on Competitiveness, is the focal point of environmental groups for his deregulatory fervor and pro-business attitude; he supported efforts to allow logging in the Northwest's old-growth forests while dismissing concerns about the spotted owl. His message: the environment costs jobs.</P><P>       The Council's goal is to boost the economy by reducing the burdens of environmental regulations. For example, they proposed reclassifying hazardous waste, allowing the least toxic types to be buried at low cost in municipal landfills. But, independent of the merits of this proposal, it was withdrawn because of election-year environmental sensitivities.</P><P>       Environmental groups strongly favor Democratic vice presidential candidate  Al Gore over Quayle.</P><P>     Sen. Gore has been an environmental advocate for many years and has recently published &quot;Earth in the Balance,&quot; a personal treatise describing his eco-philosophy and prescriptions for change. He advertises his compassion and commitment to environmental issues and speaks constantly of &quot;the dangerous dilemma that our civilization now faces,&quot; and how he has renewed his commitment to ecology.</P><P>     And Gore's prescriptions are radical. One example from his book is &quot;the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period.&quot; This is a worrisome proposal because Gore considers only the benefits of this idea and not the concurrent costs. He fails to ask the question that good ecologists must ask when confronting a proposed change, &quot;And then what?&quot; What are the likely direct and indirect consequences of his proposals, such as an increased number of power plants to power the presumed electric cars?</P><P>        When considering the greenhouse effect, Gore asserts that skeptics' theories &quot;should not be given equal weight,&quot; because such consideration, &quot;undermines the effort to build a solid base of public support for the difficult actions we must soon take.&quot; He ignores a recent Greenpeace poll showing that nearly half of the atmospheric scientists polled agreed that we have experienced no warming due to the Greenhouse effect, and that another quarter or so don't feel sufficiently informed to take a position.</P><P>     Most disturbingly, Gore wants an elite to make decisions for a public he seems not to trust. His conscious rejection of open scientific debate and blind advocacy for governmental policies that will drastically affect every American are the marks of zealotry, not understanding.</P><P>     People who &quot;know&quot; the truth often seek coercive government action to enforce their visions. As America's founders so well understood, this approach is seldom the answer to our problems. Gore's unswerving, and uncritical, environmental ideology deserves the same skepticism as Dan Quayle's single-minded and shortsighted protection of business interests.</P><P>       Gore is right, however, when he sees a false dichotomy between jobs and the environment. We can have a clean environment and economic progress. In the long run they are mutually dependent. That is something which Vice President Quayle does not seem to acknowledge.</P><P>     But creating institutions that foster these real benefits is not easy. Converting rhetoric into reality is tough.</P><P>     Both Gore and Quayle could learn that the solutions to environmental problems lie with the cooperation of responsible decision-makers. Solutions must involve knowledge of actions affecting the environment, identification of those decision-makers who influence such actions, and creation of incentives for those decision-makers to act responsibly. The key step is the creation of new legal and economic arrangements that employ property rights and market incentives to achieve environmental ends. This is the environmental leadership America needs.</P><P>     Several environmental groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, understand and apply this logic. Neither vice presidential contender, talking in absolutes about the apocalypse, whether it be environmental or economic, has yet articulated this understanding. Each promotes his own brand of environmental demagoguery.</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

No amount of concern will be enough to avoid environmental harm if information is of poor quality and incentives are perverse. How can we best channel our interest in environmental quality into constructive action? &quot;Least-cost planning&quot; offers one approach.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has two basic components. First, planners must scrutinize their assumptions and consider the feasibility of alternatives when reality does not unfold as planned - and it seldom does. Second, planners must look fairly at all alternatives and select least-cost options, not favored technologies. Least-cost plans tend to select flexible, adaptable options that can be changed when conditions change.</P><P>     Thirty years ago, E.F. Schumacher noted that small is beautiful and that approaches or technologies that fit in one place may not do so in another. Least-cost planners generally agree. The Northwest's Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) fiasco is the catastrophe that launched least-cost planning into the electric and gas utility markets. Can we apply this lesson to inflexible, capital-intensive transportation options, such as light rail, to avoid future financial catastrophes and a resultant disenchantment with government actions at all levels?</P><P>       In 1968, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), which markets electricity for the Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers, and publicly owned utilities, began developing its Hydro-Thermal Power Program. In developing this program, BPA made two crucial mistakes.</P><P>     First, it embraced untenable assumptions about the future demand for electricity. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Northwest's consumption of electricity grew by an annual average of 7 percent. Regional power planners assumed these increases would continue indefinitely. They &quot;knew&quot; that neither technological change nor price increases would slake our thirst for electric power.</P><P>     Second, BPA looked at one option, nuclear power, and made an inflexible plan around that option. BPA envisioned utilities constructing and operating 20 undesigned, untested nuclear power plants between 1975 and 1990. The novel nature of the nuclear plants foreshadowed large unanticipated costs.</P><P>     The program carried a price tag of billions. BPA offered a carrot and a stick to the region's utilities to encourage them to commit to the program. The carrot was a financing mechanism that shifted much of the risk onto BPA's rate payers. It remains with us today.</P><P>     BPA Administrator Donald Hodel, Ronald Reagan's future Secretary of Energy, offered the stick in 1976: a warning that after 1983, BPA could no longer guarantee adequate power to the region. (He later replaced Jim Watt as Secretary of Interior.) Hodel proudly called himself &quot;a prophet of shortage.&quot; Utilities signed up. WPPSS started five of the seven nuclear plants it was to build. Puget Power tried siting two plants on the Skagit River. Utilities in Oregon tried siting two nuclear plants at Pebble Creek.</P><P>     However, BPA's program was static, and the economy, like a complex ecosystem, is dynamic.</P><P>     Economic change was as catastrophic to WPPSS as the end of the ice age was to the woolly mammoths. Rising interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s dramatically reduced the attractiveness of capital-intensive investments such as nuclear plants. Industrial demand fell as people responded to higher energy prices. We insulated water heaters and attics, lowered thermostats, and installed double-, triple- and quadruple-paned windows. The projected annual 7 percent increases in consumption dropped dramatically; today, most utilities expect 1-2 percent annual growth.</P><P>     By 1983, WPPSS defaulted on bonds valued at $2.25 billion. Like echoes in a canyon, repercussions of that default continue to echo across the Northwest. Poor planning and perverse incentives led public officials to approve projects that squandered millions of dollars every year.</P><P>     In the end, even fierce resistance by nuclear power enthusiasts, WPPSS insiders, and Wall Street financiers could not staunch the financial hemorrhaging, technical mismanagement, and public disgust with WPPSS. WPPSS collapsed. Like the mammoths, it left many skeletons while a few collected ivory. WPPSS also left behind a valuable lesson.</P><P>     Reformers thrust least-cost planning upon BPA's central planners. Least-cost planning found lower-cost means to meet consumer demands and made it much harder to justify investment in favored technologies such as nuclear power or perhaps light rail. &quot;Low-tech&quot; conservation enabled electrical power demand to grow without the addition of untested, costly nuclear plants. Better use is made of existing facilities, a matter of no small environmental consequence.</P><P>     In a dynamic system like the economy, flexible and adaptable resources are required to meet changing demands. Least-cost planning has saved billions for Northwest electricity users and has lessened the impact of regional growth on the environment.</P><P>       It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible not to apply the lessons from WPPSS to an inflexible, capital-intensive program in the Northwest today: light rail.</P><P> ________ <BR> John A.

<P>    Here's a benchmark to evaluate environmental policy: economic security and environmental protection go together. Conversely, when environmental policies thwart material wants, green goals languish.  Only when environmental policies foster economic security and productivity can we reasonably expect long term protection.  This understanding helps us protect environmental values.</P>

<P> Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Garrett Hardins' &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; are bench marks of environmental history.  Both works were in process for years, noted only by a few professionals and by a elite audience.  In October of 1993 a new benchmark of environmental thinking was established at Airlie House, a conference center near Washington D.C.  Under the auspices of the Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation, a group of 60 people from 20 countries met to reconsider environmentalism.  The group included anthropologists, field biologists, tribal leaders and donors.  </P>

<P> Their thinking is summarized in a brief, attractive booklet, The View from Airlie House.   They concluded that despite elaborate efforts, the conventional approach to conservation wasn't working.  One critical reason is strategic:  </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The chief strategy of conservationists for more than a century has been exclusionary and implicitly misanthropic....establish protected areas  ...and then safeguarding these areas by carefully limiting human use....The methods of this strategy have been proscription and enforcement--laws and penalties, wardens and guns, in some cases fences and gates....Biological diversity can't be preserved...by setting it aside within protected areas.
&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The participants identified five flaws in this approach.  First is the problem inherent to &quot;island ecology&quot;.  Small protected areas lose diversity over time.  Second, this protected area strategy is too costly and scattered to protect the world's biologically rich landscapes.  Third, governments lack the means to protect borders of sanctuaries.  Fourth, &quot;The protected-area approach, dependent on centralized power and top-down planning, has often robbed rural communities of their traditional user-rights over forests, waters, fisheries, and wildlife, without offering appropriate remuneration.&quot;  Hence, local people see conservation efforts as anti-development and anti-people.  </P>

<P> Finally, this strategy amplifies conflict.  &quot;Blockading rural people against the use of their own landscape without offering them viable alternatives will always, to the blockaded, seem perverse and intolerable.  And will always, consequently be futile.&quot;  Although the focus at Airlie House was upon the Third World, this is also a good but incomplete explanation of the origins of the Wise Use Movement in the American West.  The institutions that yield anti-protection sentiments throughout the Third World operate in the rural areas of the US and Canada.</P>

<P> The approach developed at Airlie is based on a series of case studies from around the world.  It features positive local participation, not proscription and enforcement alone.  It seeks ways to make local communities the beneficiaries and custodians of conservation efforts.  The phrase &quot;community-based conservation&quot; captures the essence of their approach.  </P>

<P> Earlier conservation efforts to protect public goods were based on exclusion and enforcement.  This approach isn't viable over the long term.  Communal use rights and systems of tenure are ignored.  Resources go to the politically favored.  This is the prevailing outcome when ever politicians can buy favor by granting access to natural resources.  </P>

<P> What's true in America is even stronger in third world nations.  Absence secure tenure, rural communities lack standing in decision making.  As a result, they lack incentives to manage for sustainability.  Their incentives are to consider short term interests and immediate gain.  Over the long term, environmental protection is impossible with out recognition of property rights and markets.  </P>

<P> It will be difficult for many greens, however sincere or intelligent,  to accept the View from Airlie, i.e., the positive linkage between use by local people and the  protection of biodiversity.  In today's environmental culture economy and ecology don't often mix.  The Foundation for Deep Ecology wants us to ignore the laws of economics.  Unfortunately for them, economic behavior seems &quot;hard wired&quot;  into our nature by the evolutionary process.  </P>

<P> But fortunately, well off, well educated people normally consider environmental quality an essential goal for a responsible culture.  According to Evert Ladd of the American Enterprise Institute, nearly three quarters of American voters consider themselves environmentalists. </P>

<P> Politicians who ignore this pervasive pro environmental feeling are in peril.  Voters did not reject environmental goals in the 1994 election.  Rather they found  repugnant the statist, bureaucratic, command-and-control means to green ends exemplified by the EPA's approach to wetlands and its management of Super Fund sites.  </P>

<P> Free market and free trade advocates are also challenged by the View from Airlie.  Strong local communities are often eroded by international trade.  Local markets involve personal relations and feelings.  Can they be protected from the relentless workings of the market process at the international level?  It's not clear that the answer is yes.  The drive toward bottom line efficiency usually erodes traditions--including the sense of place so critical to preservation.</P>

<P> The View from Airlie offers an innovative perspective on effective and viable protection of ecological values.  This is progress.  We've tried command and control and found it wanting.  It's time for community-based conservation and for rethinking environmentalism.  </P>

<H1>Entrepreneurs Harmonize Economies with Ecology</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> Let's celebrate our most creative laborers -- the entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs have been neglected by economists and ignored or derided by environmentalists.  Environmentalist Al Gore sees entrepreneurial innovation as &quot;alchemy of a very dangerous form&quot;.  Economist Mark Casson notes that economic modelling &quot;leaves no role for the entrepreneur.&quot;  The economics discipline has become ever more abstract and mathematical.  Economists are selected for their sophistication in math and statistics, not their understanding of how the world works.  They have no way of modelling the creative uncertainty of entrepreneurs.  Hence, economics neglects them.</P>

<P>This is too bad, because everyone works for love and money and no one gets enough of either.  It is indeed unfortunate that entrepreneurs aren't at least appreciated if not loved for they are the catalysts of progress and change.  They seek opportunities to create value--but the values sought need not be measured in dollars.</P>

<P>We find successful entrepreneurs in the environmental and human service contexts but more would be welcome.  They created Habitat for Humanity, the <A HREF="http://www.rmef.org">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A> and Eagle Mount (a Bozeman organization providing skiing, horseback riding and other outdoor activities to disabled children). </P>

<P>Here's one way entrepreneurs affected the wood products industry.  Just twenty years ago approximately 40% of the logs brought to mills ended as waste.  Processing and disposing of the unusable wood cost labor and money and resulted in pollution.  Teepee burners converted nearly half of each log into disposable wastes, toxic by-products, and sulphurous air pollution.</P>

<P>Radical environmentalists used such examples to advocate a &quot;return to nature&quot;.  They rejected capitalism, science, technology, and economic progress.  Mankind should break the shackles of urban decay and industrial blights like the paper mills, and become hunter-gatherers and organic farmers, living in peace with the land.  Their romantic solution ignores the power of the entrepreneur to bring economic progress and environmental improvement.  The next chapter in the timber mill story illustrates this.</P>

<P>Since the 1970s, entrepreneurial innovation has transformed forest products into a leaner, cleaner industry.  Entrepreneurs found value where waste and pollution once dominated.  They effectively processed the once unusable fiber into valuable goods like particle board.  Entrepreneurial energies created value while by reducing industrial impact on the environment.  The teepee burners were closed and industrial waste became useful products.  Today, less than 5% of wood rolling into timber mills is wasted and pollution has been cut 80 to 90 percent.</P>

<P>This entrepreneurial success story reveals a solution antithetical to radical environmentalism.  Bringing the masses closer to nature will make them more reliant on natural resources, like trees, soil, and rivers.  This primitive, decentralized dependency will lead to increasing, not decreasing, environmental pressures.  Professor Martin Lewis writes in his book, Green Delusions, &quot;If we were all to split wood, the United States would be a deforested, soot-choked wasteland within a few decades.&quot;</P>

<P>Alternatives to improving environmental quality require tapping entrepreneurial ingenuity and harmonizing our economies with our ecologies.  For example, copper mining once faced dual problems: massive pit mines scarred the countryside and a global copper shortage seemed imminent.  Now, pit mining is in decline and copper is abundant, because entrepreneurs found a better way.  They found sand.</P>

<P>To meet the demands of the the Information Age, entrepreneurs discovered and implemented a substitute for copper in the form of sand-based fiber optics.  A fiber optic cable made of 25 kilograms of sand can transmit the same information as a cable made from 1,000 tons of copper.</P>

<P>Such progress pinpoints the key entrepreneurial role.  Today, soft drink cans require only a fifth of the metal that they needed in 1975.  We adopt stronger metals, better energy efficiency, and smarter designs as entrepreneurs move up learning curves.</P>

<P>Entrepreneurs are also important in the policy arena.  Groundwater in the Los Angeles basin is valuable.  After World War II, the race to pump water from the West and Central Basins jeopardized the water supply.  In her study of groundwater management, Dr. Elinor Ostrom emphasizes &quot;how public entrepreneurship can be used as a strategy to transform the structure of incentives facing those jointly using a [natural resource]&quot; into effective, sustainable solutions.  Public entrepreneurs devised arrangements where water pumpers manage themselves to conserve the resource.</P>

<P>The growth of service industries in America, the Information Age, miniturization and the search for &quot;green technologies&quot; all point to a future where economic progress includes environmental protection.  Many perceptions of the old &quot;growth versus nature&quot; trade-off are false.  With institutions that provide regulatory stability and secure property rights, ecology, liberty, and prosperity become complements, not competitors.  We can hope that some year a political entrepreneur will understand these possibilities and mobilize reform. </P>

<TITLE>Regional Transit Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/10/95</P><H1><P>Regional transit: learning the hard lessons of WPPSS</P></H1><P>           COUNTY executives from King, Pierce and Snohomish counties recently sent a letter to the state Legislature asking for a &quot;transportation summit&quot; to address a broad range of issues related to transportation in the Puget Sound region. The proposed two-day summit, tentatively scheduled for June, represents an excellent opportunity to educate legislators and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) about least-cost analysis</P><P>       On March 14, voters in portions of these three counties rejected the Regional Transit Authority's proposed Regional Transit System. Without a doubt, they had many motivations for voting &quot;no.&quot; What is clear is that voters have moved much farther up the learning curve than the RTA's backers.</P><P>     Transportation bureaucracies across the U.S. show a consistent bias toward capital-intensive, inflexible systems that require continuing, expensive bureaucratic oversight. Voters, who after all are the ones who have to pay for this idea, have expressed their belief that we can reduce travel times, pollution and stress more cheaply and effectively by other means.</P><P>     One approach is to apply least-cost planning to transit. This is not easy, but few important things are. It took the WPPSS fiasco to thrust least-cost planning upon the electric-utility industry. And as King Cushman (Director of the Transportation Planning Department at the Puget Sound Regional Council) correctly cautions, transit is an inherently more complex area than electric power.</P><P>     Least-cost planning has been used for years in the electric industry and it may take years to make it similarly useful for transit. Nevertheless, least-cost planning has proven useful in addressing the complex and changing Northwest power market; it could also help us evaluate our transit options.</P><P>     The mission of least-cost planners is to satisfy various demands at the lowest total cost. This is important because there are many worthy tasks competing for our limited public resources. Adopting relatively cheap, highly effective solutions first allows us to adjust and meet demands more quickly.</P><P>     The first principle of least-cost planning is to find options consistent with our goals. In its own master plan, the RTA found Western Washington's proposed $6.7 billion transit system would not significantly reduce traffic congestion or automobile-related air pollution.</P><P>     Who would seriously consider a plan that fails to accomplish its primary goals? Is the RTA seriously trying to diminish congestion, or does it have another agenda? If so, what is it?</P><P>       The second principle is to study all options fairly. WPPSS failed in part because planners looked at nuclear power through rose-colored glasses. Many people, myself included, have a romantic view of trains. This may cloud our perception of light rail as it appears in the regional transit plan. But only a bureaucracy spending other peoples' money could indulge a romantic association with trains to the tune of $6.7 billion.</P><P>     Whenever anyone proposes additional taxes to raise money for public projects, we should look critically at our options. This seems especially difficult when it comes to trains. In &quot;A Desire Named Streetcar,&quot; U.S. Department of Transportation analyst Don Pickrell reviewed transit plans in eight cities. He found that officials refused to reconsider their support for rail, even when presented with figures showing that rail projects would not cover even the operating costs, ignoring capital costs.</P><P>     In our region, planners presented reasonable estimates of ridership and costs. Both estimates showed that the proposal was hugely expensive and would not reduce congestion or automobile-related pollution. Nevertheless, many officials, including Seattle Mayor Norm Rice and King County Executive Gary Locke, publicly supported the RTA proposal. The desire for streetcars left them and others as blind to the transit situation as Blanche DuBois was blind to her emotions in the Tennessee Williams play.</P><P>     There are many alternatives to the RTA's proposal. Present policies allowing parking on city streets and enabling firms to provide &quot;free&quot; parking for their employees make driving less burdensome. These policies could be changed. Drivers could also be charged congestion tolls, collected electronically without time-consuming toll booths, to induce them to acknowledge the social costs of driving.</P><P>     Air-quality programs could do more to reduce automobile pollution by using remote sensing to detect and require cleanup of the dirtiest cars. The dirtiest 10 percent of cars, those responsible for 60 percent of pollution, could be purchased with gas-tax money and removed from the roads.</P><P>     Walking and biking are clean and cheap transit options. Such options can be encouraged by constructing more pedestrian-friendly thoroughfares like the Burke Gilman Trail. Carpools, vanpools, smaller buses and more HOV lanes all make better use of existing roads.</P><P>     The RTA's plan is not a precise analog to WPPSS' poorly considered nuclear dream-cum-nightmare. However, the two projects do share a focus upon massive, capital-intensive, inflexible systems. Both evidence a gross inattention to effectiveness and cost. Both imply Olympic-class hubris.</P><P>     Least-cost planning could have saved Northwest electricity consumers millions of dollars and much embarrassment. Let us not have another fiasco with our roads.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.

<H1>A Green Campaign Speech for a Better Environment</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>
<P>
Some day, a politician will offer reforms harmonizing environmental quality with responsible liberty and modest prosperity. This niche in our political ecology is vacant. Incentives to fill it have been weak.
</P>
<P>
This, however, is rapidly changing. Republican representative Sherwood Boehlert of NY said, "There were some valuable lessons learned by some who ignored environmental policy at their own peril." Celinda Lake, a Democrat pollster, explained in the past election, "the environment played a very important role". The incumbents who were defeated came from suburban and upscale districts. She notes: "The environment played a very heavy role in those districts."
</P>
<P>
But the candidates haven't yet caught up to the electorate. Democrats prefer "Nanny State" solutions to community conservation. Al Gore's learning curve for effective, efficient, and equitable environmental policy seems as flat as a pre-Galileo Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, despite their 1994 "revolution", favor the exploiters and extractors. Dole was linked to ethanol-subsidy addict Archer Daniels Midland. Congress members including Helen Chenoweth and Tom DeLay bulldozed their favored corporate interests over environmental values. And Jack Kemp couldn't even pronounce the E.P.A.
</P>
<P>
Both parties are beholden to entrenched special interests. It seems elephants can't forget to plunder, and asses can't learn new ways.
</P>
<P>
Ross Perot's Reform Party doesn't even mention the environment. The upstart "Green Party" even with Ralph Nader, America's most famous professional agitator, won only 2.4% of California's vote. And <A HREF="http://www.lp.org/">Libertarian Party</A> candidate Harry Browne did great on Internet polls, with a landslide in Cyber-America. But, like Perot, Browne's platform ignored environmental topics.
</P>
<P>
Here is a green campaign speech, available to all candidates. It's provided to candidates from all parties. Longer versions are available in FREE's "Green Blueprint for America," and a shorter version is found in "The Candidate's Guide to Environmental Issues" by Joe Bast of the <A HREF="http://www.heartland.org/">Heartland Institute</A>.

<TR>
	<TD><P>
"I believe in protecting the environment. I believe in conservation and preservation, in parks and wilderness, in using, enjoying, and stewarding our natural environment. We all have a duty to make this world a safer and cleaner place.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our progress in improving the environment. Since the first Earth Day, air is cleaner, water is cleaner, and many animals are rebounding. Lead emissions have virtually disappeared and water quality, especially in the Great Lakes, has greatly improved. The bald eagle and peregrine falcon have made dramatic recoveries.
</P>

<P>
"We can do better still. Problems of disappearing habitat, ineffective regulations, and new pollution require innovative policy tools. The easy solutions have already been implemented. Next, we must address insensitive and inefficient public lands management, unnecessarily high regulatory costs, and unintended consequences of environemental mandates. We need a new environmentalism for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"My environmental vision sees a safer and cleaner world. Its foundation is sound science rather than hysteria. Citizens are demanding policies that deliver the biggest "bang for the buck." Policies that fail to respect people's liberty and property will fail. We must, however, recognize that, at times, rights conflict. Is my clean air worth your job? My cheap power, your salmon? We can't avoid such trade-offs. Here are seven principles that will help us wisely and fairly achieve a better environment.
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
"<B>1. Demand sound science:</B><DD> Too often, crisis entrepreneurs create hysteria in order to drive their policies and increase their own budgets. Peer-reviewed science is critical to reform.
<DT>
"<B>2. Prioritize risks:</B> <DD>Our resources are limited, so we must get the most for our money. Cost-benefits analysis can help prioritize risk and first address the greatest risk to our health and to our environment. We want the most environmental benefit for the least cost.
<DT>"<B>3. Decentralize decision-making:</B> <DD>Command-and-control, one-size-fits-all, centralized planning falsely assumes that all communities are identical. This approach stifles creativity and wastes scarce resources. Distant bureaucrats can't manage local environments with sensitivity or efficiency. Letting locals make decisions encourages innovation, learning, and responsibility. But locals must recognize regional and national interests.
<DT>"<B>4. Carefully privatize some public assets:</B> <DD>Commodities should be produced by private interests who anticipate and respond to market signals. Amenitites should be preserved and made available by public trusts. The federal government should monitor and conduct research, not manage and redistribute to the well-organized. Bureaucracies tend to foster waste, corruption, and short-term political calculus.
<DT>"<B>5. Respect property rights:</B> <DD>The Constitution requires due compensation when government takes or restricts private owners' property. When government is used as an engine of plunder, the plundered usually react. Unjust environmental policies build enemies of those whose cooperation is vital, like farmers, ranchers, and forest owners.
<DT>"<B>6. Hold polluters accountable:</B> <DD>Courts can and should hold polluters responsible for the damage they cause. Let them scramble to find appropriate technology.
<DT>"<B>7. Promote prosperity:</B> <DD>Demand for environmental quality is like that for BMWs, foreign travel, and gourmet food; it increases with education and income.
</DL></P>
<P>"The American public is committed to environmental quality. We've made much progress in that direction. To do more, we need to promote prosperity, secure property rights, and responsible freedom. These are values worthy of America's heritage and a bridge to a greener future. Thank you for your vote next Tuesday."

<H1>Conquest of the Columbia Carried Tremendous Costs</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P>Some books change our thinking about institutions long taken for granted. Marc Reisner's <CITE>Cadillac Desert</CITE> explained how Western water flows uphill toward political payoffs.  Alston Chase's <CITE>Playing God in Yellowstone</CITE> exposed the politics which trump both science and economics in our national parks.  They herald fundamental reform by publicizing the gaps between intentions and results.  They show how agencies created to promote the public interest become part of an iron triangle of special interests.  The beneficiaries become accustomed to the arrangements and view them as entitlements and a way of life.  </P>

<P>Blaine Harden's new book, <CITE>A River Lost: The Life and Death of the Columbia</CITE>, describes such a situation.  The series of dams throttling the Columbia River and its tributaries delivers approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of water each year to 4,000 farmers in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project.  The average Project Farm has received a taxpayer subsidy of at least $2.1 million in the irrigation infrastructure.  The government also guarantees electricity to Project farmers at one twenty-seventh the wholesale price.</P>

<P>Cheap power entices farmers to pump water to their crops, sell excess water to their neighbors, generate electricity from the water flowing through their irrigation canals, and then sell that electricity at market rates.  Ninety percent of the cost of a profitable farm in the Project is borne by taxpayers and electricity consumers elsewhere in the country.</P>

<P>Of course, Project farmers love this system; &quot;The more water they suck out of the river, the more profits they have.&quot;</P>

<P>In the Colmbia Basin, federal hydroelectric and irrigation programs from the New Deal have transformed once-arid farmland into a bountiful region producing alfalfa for Japanese cattle and 80% of America's fast-food french fries.  </P>

<P>In Harden's words, the Columbia &quot;was killed more than sixty years ago and was reborn as plumbing.&quot;  The river where Lewis and Clark encountered &quot;verry bad&quot; whitewater rapids is now operated to mimick a lake sufficiently placid and stagnant for hydroplane races.</P>

<P>Special interests tranformed the Columbia into plumbing.  According to historian Donald Worster, the Columbia was killed by dams and reborn as money.  Hydroelectric dams mean big money to farmers, utilities, electricity consumers, the federal Bureau of Reclamation, and barge operators between Portland and Lewiston, Ida.  New tourist and recreation industries, like windsurfing the Gorge, are inextricably tied to the river.</P>

<P>The federally subsidized conquest of the Columbia had its costs.  Indian tribes lost their culture, their land, and their river.  Today, 60,000 commercial fishing jobs are in jeopardy.  And taxpayers still foot the bill.  The last, and perhaps most pivotal, victim is the endangered salmon, for the conquest of the Columbia has decimated the region's wild populations.  Over a quarter of the Northwest's salmon stocks are extinct, and half are endangered.</P>

<P>We can learn from Harden's stories:  First, to restore the Columbia and its salmon, we must understand the diverse special interests surrounding the river.  And second, subsidies and powerful centralized government action create special interests and institutionalize and channel their support.  The result is overexploitation of both the environment and the federal budget.</P>

<P>Harden repeatedly demonstrates the effects of the &quot;iron triangles&quot; in the Columbia.  An agency embarks on a public works project, private groups organize to collect those benefits, and they in turn support politicians who continue funding the agency's projects.  </P>

<P>Harden tells how this political juggernaut brought pressure to bear on dissenters, like Professor Norman Whittlesey of <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">Washington State University</A>, who testified against the inefficiencies and wealth transfers of massive Project subsidies.  Bureaucrats routinely suppressed evidence or simply ignored their deleterious effects on indians, salmon, and the environment.  Farmers, barge operators, and utilities remain in denial.  Harden quotes a teacher at <A HREF="http://www.bbcc.ctc.edu">Big Bend Community College</A> in Moses Lake, Brenda Teals, who says, &quot;Farmers think those irrigation ditches fell out of the sky.&quot;</P>

<P>The vast majority of worthwhile irrigation projects were built privately and without federal subsidies.  Only after the best sites were developed were government subsidies required.</P>

<P>Can taxpayers still afford the iron triangles created by grandiose government schemes?  The nation's taxpayers pay for 80% of most major irrigation projects.  The farmers are encouraged to draw as much water as they can, the federal agencies are encouraged to &quot;operate&quot; the river like a machine, and the politicians are encouraged to appropriate more funds for their contributors.</P>

<P>This iron triangle polarizes Northwesterners.  Harden relates &quot;the most enduring consequence of federal control in my home country was not pollution, but intolerance.&quot;  In Hanford, it was technocrats and technicians against indians and hayseeds.  On the river, it was barge pilots against windsurfers and fish lovers.  Inland, it was subsidized farmers against enviros seeking to dismantle the artificial foundation of the Northwest economy.  Along the Cascade Mountains, it is becoming &quot;East-siders&quot; versus &quot;West-siders&quot;.</P>

<P>The polarization has forest industries blaming dams, fishermen, and farmers. Farmers blame deep-sea gillnets.  Fishermen blame dam builders.  Barge operators blame bureaucratic meddling.  Federal agencies deny responsibility and point to hatcheries.  Utilities claim transporting salmon in trucks is better than letting them swim.  Consensus seems more distant than Lewis and Clark's past.</P>

<P>Salmon and Northwesterners cannot live in harmony when politics generate benefits.  The iron triangles produce toxic byproducts.  As President Clinton has proclaimed, the era of Big Government is over.  Blaine Harden's book tells why we should be grateful. </P>

<H1>Marking the End of an Era of Crisis Entrepreneurship</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>, Vice President Al Gore writes in the book's Foreward, discusses &quot;compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  He calls it the sequel to the first enviromental benchmark, <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  He's wrong.  </P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> marks the end of an era of public susceptibility to ill-founded hysteria and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, serious and intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and posturing are pass&eacute; in the environmental policy arena.</P>

<P>The book's authors are Theo Colburn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a former reporter, respectively. This &quot;scientific detective story&quot; is provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot;  It charges synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, and Tide) with disrupting hormones.  They allege hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, ranging from illiteracy to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  Their solution?  Ban synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The book's timing is immaculate.  It comes as the National Academy of Sciences convenes to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrives on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day.  <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> has a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It is PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>Yet it's flopping.  Reputable responders trash the book.  The <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://update.wsj.com"><CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com"><CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE></A>, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>, and <CITE>Washington Times</CITE> have criticized the book for all manner of flaws, from hysteria mongering to junk science and from faulty logic to poor writing.  It's a sign we're making progess.  Here's why.</P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  That's good news for those of us who rank environmental quality among our highest priorities.  We learn more from failure than success, and this failure offers important lessons for environmental reformers.</P>

<P>People in the environmental movement are far more sophisticated today than in 1962.  They recognize that greens attract both &quot;crisis entrepreneurs&quot; and genuine advocates for the public interest.  These crisis hustlers generate new support by touting an emergency and then providing avenues down which people can parade their good intentions and express their sincerity by sending money.  Conservative, quiet groups such as the Isaak Walton League and American Forestry Association lose to those that emphasize drama, apocalypse, and urgency at the expense of intellectual integrity.  </P>

<P>But hysterical environmentalism ultimately backfires.  Greenpeace International's mission against chlorine is an excellent example.  Their anti-chlorine campaign led to Peru reducing the chlorine it added to its water supply.  The result?  A cholera epidemic swept through insufficiently chlorinated water supplies, taking far more lives than the chlorine ban could possibly have saved.</P>

<P>Colburn and friends deride the cancer scare of the early 1970s for turning cancer into &quot;the ultimate measure of our fears.&quot;  They see our preoccupation with high cancer rates as &quot;more myth than reality.&quot;  Scientists and regulators in the &quot;War on Cancer&quot; wasted precious time and resources.  Colburn recognizes the perils of overstating cancer threats.  Ironically, she tells us that, compared to cancer, hormone disruptors pose a far greater danger.  Disruptors may destroy humankind.</P>

<P>But, after a few scares, people become jaded and cynical.  Short-term opportunism thwarts constructive outcomes.</P>

<P>Such opportunism may work in the short-run, but it antagonizes scientists and policy analysts.  For example, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> greatly exaggerates the scientific consensus regarding declining sperm counts.  The book's misleading science invites criticism and undermines its alleged purpose.  It's immediate supporters are likely to feel as foolish by the autumn of the year 2000 as those who predicted global cooling should today.</P>

<P>Also, environmentalists can learn that benefits normally imply costs.  Only when they recognize both, and acknowledge inescapable trade-offs, can they recommend constructive and effective policies.  This is not a cost-free world.</P>

<P>But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> considers only the negative effects of synthetic chemicals.  It offers no appropriate responses.  If plastics, pesticides, and paints merely sabotaged our biochemistry, Colburn's recommended ban might make sense.  But synthetic chemicals are integral to modern civilization precisely because of their benefits.</P>

<P>Good public policy must incorporate the risks, benefits, and harms of each issue. Lorenz Rhomberg, Ph.D. of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis writes, &quot;a crash program of [hormone-disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.&quot;  Colburn ignores these trade-offs.</P>

<P>Sincere, sophisticated and sensible environmentalists shun chicanery and irresponsible reforms.  They see these proposals are more dangerous than the synthetic chemicals Colburn pillories.</P>

<P>Insisting that chemicals be presumed guilty of hormone disruption until proven innocent by chemical manufacturers is terribly foolish.  Even undergraduates should know one can't prove the negative.  Anyone can always claim we simply haven't looked hard enough.  By requiring chemical manufacturers to do the impossible, she dooms the beneficiaries a modern chemicals to the 1800s.  Failing to acknowledge the huge benefits of modern chemistry is naive or disingenuous.</P>

<P>Savvy Americans expect misguided policy proposals from even gifted scientists.  We understand that for PR firms image trumps truth.  We expect and understand when crisis entrepreneurs with Greenpeace incite panics to build budgets.  But why do smart scientists recommend pathologically unwise policies?</P>

<P>When scientists leave the lab and enter the policy arena, thier body temperatures and IQ scores often seem to converge.  A future scientific detective story may explain this tragic phenomenon.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> already has the answer:  hormone disruptors. </P>

It was inspired by our first Earth Day 25 years ago. Shortly thereafter, it became a rallying cry for the green revolution</P><P>      For more than 20 years, the idea was widely supported without question. But does a total ban on whaling make scientific sense? Equally important, do advocates of a ban hold the moral high ground?</P><P>       Life is much simpler when we think in black and white. With this binary model, there are good ideas, such as the promotion of liberty, and bad, such as the abuse of government's coercive power. But environmental truths are not so simple; they are often scientifically complex and highly emotional.</P><P>     Complexity and emotionalism can lead to problems, especially when cultural differences collide. Received &quot;truths,&quot; such as &quot;we must ban the harvest of whales,&quot; become cultural imperialism in green camouflage. The whaling issue illustrates these points and helps us clarify thinking on environmental matters more generally. It shows us the importance of probing the superficial appeal of environmental shibboleths.</P><P>     The notion &quot;save the whales&quot; is about as precise as &quot;save the birds.&quot; There are many species of whales, at widely varying risks of extinction. The largest is the great blue whale weighing up to 150 tons and equal in length to a Boeing 737-200.</P><P>     The deadliest is Orcinus orca, the killer whale, which often hunts in packs like an aquatic wolf. The smartest is the bottle-nosed dolphin, whose brain-to-body-weight ratio more closely approximates humans' than any other mammal. And then there's the minke, a small, plentiful whale found in many of the world's oceans.</P><P>     Before we set out to &quot;save&quot; these diverse creatures we should realize three things:</P><P>       --  Many whales species are far from endangered;</P><P>     --  There is no a priori reason to assume that hunting individual whales will extinguish an entire species; and</P><P>       --  We display an arrogant disregard for traditional cultures when we impose the values of our wealthy, highly modernized society upon them. This last point deserves further attention because Western environmentalists often assume their anti-whaling position is the correct one.</P><P>     In Western cultures, whales had substantial commercial value for several centuries. In the Middle Ages, Norwegians, Britons and Germans hunted whales, chiefly for food. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, whales, especially toothed whales such as the sperm, were hunted primarily for their oil, an important input for lighting and soap-making. (&quot;One candlepower,&quot; a unit of light, is defined as the amount of light given off by a pure spermaceti candle burning at a rate of 120 grams per hour.)</P><P>       The U.S. led the world in whaling during the early to mid-19th century, and many coastal New England towns owed their prosperity to the whaling industry.</P><P>     In a classic &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; many species dwindled in numbers and several were threatened with extinction. Since whales were owned only after harpooned and landed, whalers lacked incentives to preserve viable breeding populations. Any whales left could be taken by other whalers. And even if incentives for conservation had existed, scientific information about how to preserve genetically viable populations was sorely lacking. Today, we have better information and know how to create proper incentives.</P><P>     Current blue and humpback whale populations are indeed low, and some species are endangered. The former Soviet Union's recurrent violations of treaties restricting whale harvests took a heavy toll, but members of some other species are plentiful. An example is the minke whale, which has long played a significant role in the Norwegian whaling industry.</P><P>     There may be up to one million minkes. In 1994, 32 Norwegian boats killed a total of 279 minkes out of an estimated regional population of 87,000 whales. This rate of about one-third of 1 percent is biologically trivial and has no significant ecological impact. However, to the centuries-old maritime societies that evolved around whaling, minkes are culturally, economically and nutritionally significant. Minkes support these villages much as buffalo supported the late 19th century Great Plains Indians.</P><P>     Proscribing a total ban on whaling denies cultures time to adjust and ignores the relative abundance of many species. Whatever its environmental and emotional appeal, an absolute ban is cultural imperialism. Can members of &quot;Save the whales!&quot; organizations justify imposing their environmental morality on other cultures? When advocates for a ban ignore scientific evidence that the minke are no more threatened than mallard ducks, their arguments carry a tinge of ethical and intellectual arrogance.</P><P>     In the end, a total ban on all whaling oversimplifies a complex issue. First, not all whales are threatened. Second, we have the technology to create transferable property rights in whales. With such guaranteed rights, whales will not be hunted to extinction. Third, whales are central to traditions of coastal villages in Japan, Norway, and Iceland. Reasonable harvest poses little threat to the continued existence of these animals. In contrast, insensitive, imperialistic Western environmentalism surely threatens these villages when it imposes its tastes on traditional cultures.</P><P>     The lessons here are clear. It would be a mark of maturity for the environmental movement if it applied these lessons to the celebration of Earth Day's 25th anniversary.</P><P> _______<BR> John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/14/96</P><H1>Economic health of fisher key to health of the fishery</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> 	Public policy failures can take their toll on economic efficiency, ecological integrity, and even human lives.  These failures are endemic to fisheries commons the world over.  Recent issues of Field and Stream, Scientific American, and National Geographic all featured stories about the dire straits of our fisheries.</P>

<P>	Now the Bering Sea brings tragic news of a third outcome of poor policy: dead fishermen. The seven crewmembers of the Seattle-based Pacesetter were safety conscious.  They fell victim to callous policies which unnecessarily endanger lives of fishermen.  The Alaskan crab fishery's open-access nature encourages a mad scramble for catches in excess of sustainable yield.  The scramble is &quot;mad&quot; not only because it's exceedingly dangerous but because society is left worse off whether the risky fishermen succeed or fail.  The system rewards overfishing, and it biases how and when to fish - even if fishermen die in the attempt. </P>

<P>	Peaceful government policies kill people all the time (e.g. CAFE standards which trade blood for oil).  Seldom are they so obvious and direct as in the fishery.  When lost lives are compounded with squandered resources and fears of a global fishery crash, even politicians might place public interest above parochial advantage.</P>

<P>	The tragedy of the fisheries commons became apparent after the 1960s, when world fish stocks collapsed under increasing fishing pressure.  Reform proposals include banishing foreign fishing fleets, quotas, requiring primitive fishing techniques, and satellite surveillance.  By examining the successes and failures of various efforts, we see what makes institutions succeed or fail.</P>

<P>	They usually fail for one reason:  appropriate responsibility for conservation lies not with beneficiaries -- fishery communities.</P>

<P>	There are many examples of bureaucrats regulating from afar, legislators ruling from on high, and monitors watching from a distance.  Remote institutions neglect local conditions.  When central planners set rules, quotas, and limits, alien practices trump local traditions and customs.  </P>

<P>	Distant legislators, central planners, and bureaucrats rarely manage effectively.  Regulations have adverse consequences, quotas lead to waste, and limits are broken.  Policing and sanctioning of fishermen by outsiders is often misguided or absent.  Low-cost means of monitoring and resolving conflicts can't be provided by underfunded state policemen and international courts.  Local fishermen too easily subvert regulations, and foreigners make off with whatever fish they can while filling the coffers afar.  Alien systems generally fail.</P>

<P>	But some got it right.  In Alanya, Turkey, a fishing village evolved an ingenious solution to their fishery in jeopardy of overfishing.  By drawing lots for fishing locations at the beginning of each season, and then rotating to a new position each day, the number of fishermen in each spot is controlled.  If anyone crosses into another's site, the fisherman there will certainly notice and has incentive to report it.  No outside enforcer is required.  Every fisherman's vested interest in their 'spot of the day' provides incentives to monitor.  Limited entry and effective enforcement are low cost, stable, and local.</P>

<P>	In the Philippines, reef fishermen using explosives and cyanide to capture exotic fish have sewn the seeds of the ecosystem's destruction by both overfishing and killing the coral reef.  Establishing offshore marine sanctuaries, where explosives and cyanide are prohibited, has reversed the tide.  Fishermen are behaving responsibly, and empty nets are starting to fill.  Illegal night fishing by foreign fleets jeopardizes the rebounding fish sanctuaries.  Local communities' authority to protect their resources must carry force and respect. </P>

<P>	Managers of the South Pacific fisheries are widely credited with success.  Vast ocean stretches are dotted with tiny island nations whose national incomes are dwarfed by the foreign companies fishing their waters.  But those nations, against the odds, have formed an institution from the ground up.  They implemented an integrated and coordinated management approach and avoided overcapitalization, wasteful regulation, and international conflict.</P>

<P>	These cases provide valuable lessons.  The stories of communities in Turkey, the Philippines, and the South Pacific, teach us that those with long-term vested interests in fishery viability usually act responsibly.  People with a stake in the future, won't act like there's no tomorrow.  In contrast, open-access fisheries invite disruptive outsiders with little incentive for sustainable behavior.  That is why enduring institutions tend to flow from the community level.  Fishing villages recognize the importance of preserving this resource.  Their very livelihoods depend on it.</P>

<P>	Successful reform links the economic health of the fishermen and managers with the biological health of the fishery.  The fishermen and the fish both lose out if decisions about when, where, and how to fish are made by those not held accountable.  Fishermen know more about local conditions and have stronger incentives to improve them.  Bureaucrats and politicians don't benefit from a healthy fishery the way a fishing community does.  </P>

<P>	We can apply the important lessons of successful institutions to prevent future tragedies.  Reforms can't bring back the Pacesetter.  But their sacrifice might motivate responsible reform.  This would be a great tribute to good men lost.</P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/01/95</P><H1><P>Hunting plays a key role in habitat conservation</P></H1> <P>          MANY environmentalists oppose hunting. They find the idea of killing animals for sport repulsive and incomprehensible. For these people, sport hunting is an obsolete remnant of our barbaric past, one excised by civilized cultures</P><P>       This position is empathically understandable, but logically paradoxical because hunters are important supporters of wildlife habitat protection. Hunters save habitat as individuals and through organizations such as Ducks Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, the Ruffed Grouse Society, Quail Unlimited, and North America Wild Sheep Foundation. Sportsmen and women know that without habitat there is no game.</P><P>     Members of the environmental community have recurrently tried to stop hunting on national wildlife refuges, and hunting is forbidden in national parks. Tensions between hunting and the animal-rights wing of environmentalism are complex and emotional. They are wrapped up with New Age religion and with &quot;junk&quot; science that falsely claims animal populations naturally regulate themselves without degrading their habitat. (The latter is a fiction propagated for political reasons by &quot;scientists&quot; within the Park Service.)</P><P>       Tensions also stem from demographic changes that insulate urbanites from nature's unpleasant realities. Prosperity has fostered an appreciation for the intrinsic value of life. But few people understand that predators, harsh winters and extensive range are necessary to preserve healthy wildlife populations. Only if &quot;challenged&quot; individual animals die will healthy populations survive. By eliminating major predators and winter range, people have sharply increased the danger of destructive crashes of whole animal populations.</P><P>     It is simply wrong to argue, as some do, that hunting does not promote environmental protection. Though hunting is not a cure-all, it is an important tool for promoting habitat conservation. It also substitutes for the natural population checks eliminated by human activity.</P><P>     A failure to accept the importance of hunting underlies the actions of John Lilburn, a member of the group, Fund for Animals. In 1990, Lilburn interfered with a state-supervised bison hunt near Yellowstone Park by interposing himself between hunters and the bison. Though we may marvel at his affection for bison, such passion threatens the bison's well being. Without natural predators, bison populations grow beyond their food supply and wander out of the park. They carry brucellosis, a disease causing cattle to abort. In terms of sound wildlife and livestock management, removing the bison was necessary.</P><P>     But, certain environmentalists resent people's enjoyment of hunting. They don't understand or accept that love of the hunt has deep cultural and perhaps biological roots. It is intellectually irresponsible to wish the love of hunting away. By accepting that hunting is loved by millions, environmentalists could tap a powerful reservoir of support for conservation.</P><P>     Hunters already pay big money for sport hunting. The Turner Ranch near Bozeman charges $9000 for a four-and-a-half day trophy elk hunt and limits the number of hunters to 30. These fees compensate the ranch for nearly $250,000 worth of grazing provided to wildlife that is not hunted.</P><P>     In Arizona, a hunter paid $303,000 for a Desert Bighorn sheep permit. That money went for wildlife research and habitat protection. Payment for hunting preserves game habitat and thereby saves less charismatic, but ecologically important species.</P><P>     If landowners and local communities cannot profit from wildlife, they may favor environmentally destructive sources of income, such as poor logging practices, or mining. This lesson holds not only for big-ticket species, but for animals with lower hunting values: deer, elk and waterfowl. Fees from hunting far exceed those from primitive recreation, bird watching, or photography.</P><P>     Hunters are a major force behind Ducks Unlimited (DU), a conservation organization with more than 600,000 members and 3,700 chapters across the United States and Canada. DU manages more than four million acres of wetland in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. It has acquired rights to these wetlands through purchases, leases and easements.</P><P>     The Boone and Crockett Club, founded in 1887, is one of the United States' first conservation organizations. Early on, it helped protect Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. The Club's 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch in Montana is winter range for hundreds of elk and mule deer and harbors grizzly bear, white tailed deer, cougar, eagles, falcons, hawks, and cutthroat trout. It is also home to a research station conducting field work in conservation. Boone and Crockett recently endowed a professorship at the University of Montana through a $1 million gift.</P><P>     A desire to accommodate hunters has changed the forest-management practices of several important timber companies, including Champion, International Paper, and Temple Inland. The companies provide more &quot;edge&quot; along clear-cuts and more diverse ecosystems as they strive to offer habitat for prime game species. These efforts sensitize employees to the importance of wildlife habitat.</P><P>     People love nature in different ways. Not everyone empathizes with today's naive but politically correct preservationist ethic. Most people opposed to hunting are well intentioned. And some people's opposition to hunting is religious. To them, ecological science is irrelevant. But the facts are clear; hunters cannot be dismissed as enemies of animals, and their efforts help preserve healthy ecosystems.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

It was printed in Science magazine in 1968 and has been reprinted hundreds of times in dozens of fields ranging from anthropology to zoology. Its essential message is profound yet simple: If a valuable resource is open to all, if it is common property and unmanaged, it will be over-exploited. The standard examples are the open range of eastern Montana in the 1880s and unmanaged ocean fisheries. Because of its implications for social as well as natural systems, it is probably the only article written by a biologist that is known by all English-speaking economists</P><P>       The author is Garrett Hardin, professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara. As Garrett used the term, &quot;tragedy&quot; is not mere unhappiness or even extreme sorrow over an outcome. Rather, tragedy resides in the solemn and remorseless working of things. Given the incentive for exploitation and the absence of constraints on use, valuable common property resources are exhausted. Ecological and economic waste are the expected consequences. Tragedy is predictable, not a puzzling aberration.</P><P>     I was honored to work with professor Hardin. Our book, &quot;Managing the Commons,&quot; was in print for nearly 15 years. It was the first environmental-studies book that stressed the importance of property rights in promoting stewardship and environmental quality. Professor Hardin is primarily responsible for its success and for teaching me principles with lasting value.</P><P>     Most importantly, Garrett taught me that we are intellectually and ethically obligated to ask the question &quot;and then what?&quot; when we evaluate environmental policy. Good intentions will not suffice. It is irresponsible to ignore predictable problems.</P><P>     But many Beltway environmentalists have done so. The results, the relentless working of things, are coming due. People are resisting new environmental legislation.</P><P>     This resistance seems paradoxical at first glance because the vast majority of Americans value environmental quality. Pollution control, habitat preservation and other green ends are widely accepted. Resistance follows from the means promoted by major national environmental groups.</P><P>     For 25 years, environmental control has been a growth industry led by crisis entrepreneurs who too often ignored costs imposed. Now we see a movement to calculate those costs. It is natural for people to weigh their costs against the benefits they receive. While Washington should keep people from imposing unwarranted burdens on others, it must not impose arbitrary burdens of its own. Opposition to the latter drives efforts to limit unfunded federal mandates.</P><P>     Crises entrepreneurs create or exaggerate &quot;problems,&quot; such as asbestos and pesticide residue, through misrepresentation and junk science. They use the fear and concern aroused in the public to generate funds and use the funds to lobby Congress. Protecting their budgets, not birds and bunnies, seems to be their primary goal.</P><P>     And what is the long-term environmental impact of crisis entrepreneurs? As real science wins out and &quot;crises&quot; are exposed as not so critical, the attentive public becomes skeptical about the importance of all environmental problems. The public also learns that the remedy offered, more federal control, is always too expensive and usually ineffective.</P><P>     Superfund, the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act are all up for renewal. Policy analysts, resource economists and more-enlightened environmentalists question the operation of these acts. Though the goals are legitimate and praiseworthy, the means are at best inappropriate and, at worst, pernicious.</P><P>     In his book, &quot;Breaking the Vicious Circle,&quot; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer noted that many federal regulations require individuals and businesses to spend vast sums to obtain excessive cleanliness. For example, companies involved in a New Hampshire waste dump were forced to pay an additional $9.3 million to further clean a site where children playing on the site could already eat a small amount of dirt each day for 70 years without significant harm. But this was not a playground, it was a swamp. The $9.3 million surely had better uses. Sadly, such mandated waste is common.</P><P>     Environmental quality is not free. When Beltway environmentalists act as though it is, they foster waste and ultimately erode environmental concern. Americans are not rejecting environmental goals. Rather, they are challenging cures that often seem worse than the disease.</P><P>     To sustain public support we must harmonize environmental quality with economic security and liberty. To do so we must seriously consider three approaches castigated by professional greens as the &quot;unholy trinity&quot;:</P><P>       1) Require cost-benefit analysis of alternative regulations so we can direct our energies where they do the most good;</P><P>     2) Limit unfunded federal mandates that constrain state and local governments from addressing local problems;</P><P>     3) Require government to compensate property owners when environmental regulations reduce property's value but not when they control significant externalities or costs foisted on others.</P><P>     These principles have been dismissed with derision by the Beltway greens. But this dismissal is dangerous because it threatens support for worthwhile green goals. As people realize the opportunism and duplicity of crisis entrepreneurs, they may discount the importance of environmental concern and replace it with attention to problems of public health, community, and personal security. It is time for environmental leaders to ask professor Hardin's question - &quot;and then what?&quot; - and advocate innovative means to reach accepted environmental ends. </P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

<P>     	Ocean fisheries exemplify &quot;common-pool resources&quot;.  It's difficult, if not impossible, to fence in or brand marine fish.  Their freedom is bound by the forces of nature.</P>

<P>     	These fish are fugitive resources.  Their migration ignores political, social, and legal boundaries.  This often leads to great tragedy.  Fisheries demonstrate the classic &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot;.  They are increasingly imperiled by fishermen engaging in traditional and honorable activities: bringing high quality food from the sea to people.  </P>

<P>     	Two problems plague both society and fish.  The first problem is that increasing world demand and technological capabilities exceed the reproductive capacity of many ecosystems.  The pre-1970s illusion of infinite abundance is gone.  </P>

<P>     	Second, and most important, fisheries lack a sustainable system of rationing the valuable, but increasingly scarce, resources.  Today, the world's fisheries are predominantly open-access.  It's first come first serve, almost devoid of rules fostering responsible behavior.  </P>

<P>     	Open-access subjects fisheries to the profound pathologies of the commons.  Fisheries suffer from overexploitation and declining profitability because fishermen behave predictably when access to a valuable resource is open to all.  In such circumstances individually and socially rational behavior diverges. Self-restraint and conservation is trumped by incentives that encourage overfishing.  Individual fishermen reel in short-term profits from overfishing while society as a whole bears the costs of economic and environmental waste.  </P>

<P>     	Fisheries commons result in ecological and economic tragedy.  Fishermen aren't dumb; they want to stop fishing once they optimize the yield of the fishery -- but if they act responsibly, they watch others continue fishing.  More and more fishermen and boats will arrive until profits disappear altogether.  As fish become harder to find, profits vanish and the long-term health of the fishery deteriorates.</P>

<P>        	Overfishing is exacerbated by another pathology: overcapitalization.   The race to reel in more and more fish encourages fishing capacity far in excess of the fishery's reproductivecarrying capacity.  Economic distortions couple environmental degradation with overinvestment in fishing capacity.  Unbridled competition produces bigger vessels, better sonar, and larger nets.  Taxpayers subsidize newer boats and better nets.  This only aggravates the situation as national politics fights marine international ecosystems.</P>

<P>     	This process spawns other pathologies.  Bycatch, the incidental landings of unsellable species, wastes enormous quantities of fish every year (Discards in shrimp fisheries can outweigh shrimp landings eight to one.).  Many fishermen practice high-grading, throwing out less valuable fish.  Fishermen lack incentives to conserve the discarded fish, because they do not bear the costs of waste.  </P>

<P>     	Regulating restraint through quotas on catch levels, minimum mesh sizes, and shortened seasons, often worsens matters.  Fishermen lobby for overinflated quotas and more subisidies for boats capable of grabbing a bigger slice of the pie.  More overcapitalization brings satellites, surveillance planes, and the latest in technology to bear in a mad scramble for fish.  Cutthroat competition in derby-style seasons presses captains to employ dangerous tactics in already hazardous fishing conditions.  </P>

<P>    	When fish cross boundaries, pathologies multiply. There is no guarantee that fish leaving one nation's waters will ever return, so the impetus is to catch as much as possible before the fish migrate.  Fishermen play one area off against the other.  The jurisdiction with the weakest regulations becomes the most popular -- and the anarchic &quot;high seas&quot; beats them all.  Some fishermen fill their quota at home, then travel to foreign waters and fish again.</P>

<P>     	There is a fisheries crisis indeed.  The pathologies involve ecology, ethics, economics, and politics.  Dozens of fisheries are depleted, many have collapsed.  Subsidies, price supports, dislocated fishermen, and sportsfishing restictions all take their toll.  The fisheries crisis caused nearly thirty international conflicts in 1994 alone.  </P>

<P>     	Avoiding the problems and preventing the tragedy of the commons requires institutional reform.  Currently, institutions usually reward fishermen for lobbying to increase subsidies and quotas, for increasing fleet capacity, for entering a fishery, and for maximizing landings in the short term.  </P>

<P>     	But there is reason for cautious hope.  The astronomical costs of maintaining fisheries commons present political entrepreneurs opportunities to innovate.  Market forces and property rights have proven effective tools for sensitive and sensible resource management.  Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), as a sort of private-property fishing rights, are finding success in New Zealand and some Alaskan fisheries.  </P>

<P>     	Economists can explain how fishermen, under better conditions, could restrain their efforts to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of fishing over the long run.  A fisherman guaranteed sole and indefinite proprietorship of an ocean resource is unlikely to squander it by overfishing.  Like responsible farmers and foresters, profit-maximizers would conserve and optimize resources -- not harvest like there is no tomorrow.  Sustainability is key, because, for them, there is a tomorrow.</P>

<P>     	Individuals and society will benefit by overcoming the political costs of reform.  Fishermen have become addicted to government subsidies for survival in overcapitalized, overexploited fisheries.  Up to now, policy-makers have lacked the political will to restrain &quot;rugged individualist&quot; fishermen.  Increasing scarcity and environmental degradation are making privatization with monitored and enforceable rules ever more attractive. </P>
 
<P>    Leaders in the fishing industry understands that pathologies of the commons are leading to disaster.  Without secure rights granted to communities or individuals, the beleaguered fisheries will drown in a tragic tide. The task is to develop institutional arrangements that harmonize ecological realities with laws of human behavior.  </P>

Baden</P><P>     Each fall my thoughts return to a boyhood of hunting.  Opening day trumped Thanksgiving and even rivaled Christmas.  Our rituals and gear provided anthropological fodder.     </P><P>      In fifth grade I created the Concord Conservation Club.  Like most rural people of my generation (I'm in my mid-50s), the green path ran through Field and Stream, the leading outdoors magazine.  I still see sportsmen as great preservers of habitat.  But with few Americans with rural roots, the links between hunting and environmentalism grow tenuous.  </P><P>     There's a growing tension, indeed an antipathy, between younger environmentalists (often vegetarians) and their elders who came to ecology through the &quot;blood sports&quot;.  Today's mainstream environmental magazines commonly ignore or denigrate hunting and hunters.</P><P>     The millions of hunters in America, however, play a powerful, direct and active role in environmental protection.  Ducks Unlimited protects over 20 million acres of wetland.  On their 6,000-acre Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch, the venerable Boone &amp; Crockett Club conducts research to harmonize agriculture with wildlife while providing habitat for elk, mule deer, grizzly bears, cougars, eagles and cutthroat trout.  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Pheasants Forever and the Ruffed Grouse Society also protect wildlife habitat by purchasing land and development rights.  Hunters have a huge stake in preserving the wildlife they sometimes hunt. </P><P>     Yet America's hunters are maligned or ostracized.  Here's a story from my last trip East:</P><P>     5:00am Saturday was dark, rainy, cold and windy.  Volvo wagons were sleeping in their driveways when a man came out of his garage with two golf bags which he leaned against a GMC Suburban.  He walked back to the kitchen and emerged with a thermos and an excited yellow lab.  The dog jumped into the Suburban, and the man lifted a golf bag behind the driver's seat.  He turned toward the lights of a tow truck pulling into his drive.  The man from AAA got out.</P><P>     &quot;Have you heard a crash?  A car hit a deer near here.  We just got the call.  Driver's all shook up and didn't give good directions.  Totaled the front end and busted the windshield.  Lucky he didn't get a deer in the face.  I gotta drag the car in; third one this week.  It gits worse every fall...</P><P>     &quot;You didn't hear anything?  No wonder with the wind and rain.  You must be nuts to play golf in this stuff...</P><P>     &quot;You're what?  Hunting ducks with golf clubs?  You must be damn good with a driver or you really are crazy...</P><P>     &quot;You've got what?  A 12 gauge and decoys in your golf bags?  Are you sure you're OK?  Did YOU hit the deer and bump your head?</P><P>     &quot;Oh, you hide the gear in golf bags!  Your neighbors would get real upset if they knew you were a hunter...</P><P>     &quot;Or even if they knew you kept guns around?  Their kids couldn't play with yours?  You must be nuts to live here.&quot;</P><P>The deer in the story, like so many animals, has lost its natural predators.  In many areas cars, not carnivores, kill deer.</P><P>     Organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Fund For Animals (FFA) assert that wildlife populations lacking predators will achieve a &quot;natural balance&quot; without degrading their environment.  But sound science and commonplace observations reveal how truncated food chains degrade ecosystems.  To protect ecosystems, we must acknowledge missing links and respond responsibly.  This is a place for tough love.  </P><P>     Hunters can promote healthy game and non-game animals.  The Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge in north Virginia, for example, safeguards endangered bald eagles.  But during the 1980s the deer population exploded and exceeded the refuge's carrying capacity by tenfold.  Without predators checking deer population, the entire Mason Neck ecosystem was distorted to the eagle's peril.  Starving deer consumed entire generations of young trees -- essentially destroying future bald eagle roosts.  And the deer weren't faring so well either.  Only disease and starvation regulated their population.  </P><P>     Despite the fervent protests and litigation of the Humane Society of America, Mason Neck managers instituted a deer hunting season in 1989.  The results are in.  Contrary to predictions of human carnage, no hunting accidents have occurred.  The deer population, although still too high, is now a fifth of its 1989 size.  The deer are healthier, exhibiting increased body weight and antler mass.  Lastly, trees and eagles' imperiled ecosystems are recovering.</P><P>     The new generation of environmentalists often finds hunting distasteful.  Vegans rarely join Ducks Unlimited.  And some activists invest millions in litigation against hunters and now fishermen.  But most have the maturity to understand how this counters habitat protection and healthy wildlife populations.  </P><P>     Hunters affect the natural balance and generate the political will which helps conserve habitat.  Members of PETA and FFA have weaker incentives to protect habitat -- so they don't.  In contrast, Ducks Unlimited bought protection for over 17 million acres of nesting grounds in Canada, 2 million acres of winter grounds in Mexico, and nearly a million acres of wetlands in the U.S.  If anti-hunting groups bought &quot;hunting-free&quot; refuges, they could introduce predators or learn that sparing Bambi can spoil entire ecosystems.  </P><P>     When considering this positive possibility, I suggest we place our hopes and expectations in separate baskets.  Anthropologists and economists can explain why hunters are important friends of habitat.  While anti-hunting activists may resist the ecological benefits of hunting, they will eventually learn that nature bats last.  And the clean-up process is seldom pretty.</P><P>_________________________________________<BR> John A.

<P>	The feuding between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hooters chain of restaurants results from government overstepping its bounds.  Government has made &quot;Hooters&quot; a household name by stimulating confrontations between market forces and those who abhor sexism and their allies in the Nanny State.</P>

<P>	People become hot and bothered over Hooters simply because &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; leave so little to the imagination.  Thus, the EEOC has targeted them.  The very thought that a business could provide an opportunity for waitresses to serve Buffalo wings with a side order of sex appeal infuriates the P.C. crowd at the EEOC.  How can the politically incorrect restaurant that provides &quot;Bunnies for Bubbas&quot; be allowed to operate?  The EEOC's calling is to bring enlightened social engineering to the masses.  Hooters' success demands their special attention.</P>

<P>	And that's precisely what happened.  No disgruntled male job applicant filed a grievance prior to the controversy.  But Hooters' very existence irritates 'Nanny State' regulators at the EEOC.  So the EEOC initiated its own three-year investigation.</P>

<P>	At an Indianapolis Hooters, for example, waitresses routinely earn from $425 to $600 for their 20-hour work week.  And in the last three years, this Hooters has tossed out a total of five people for offensive language.  And once, only once, a man inappropriately touched a Hooters Girl and spent two weeks in jail for assault.  Look, enjoy, but behave yourself.  The system seems to work.</P>

<P>	The Reno Hooters provides another excellent example.  This restaurant is a bastion of conservatism in a city ruled by casinos, showgirls, and genuinely scantily-clad cocktail waitresses.  But the EEOC is scrutinizing Hooters, not Caesar's Palace.  This is because the law recognizes that some positions are intrinsically gender-biased.  Cowgirls and showgirls are girls, Lady Macbeth is a lady, and women's restroom attendants are women.</P>

<P>	But Hooters Girls can be boys, according to EEOC investigators.  They concluded that Hooters is just a restaurant.  In their estimation, men can fill a Hooters' tank top and serve appetizers just as well as women.  Hence, the EEOC fines Hooters $22 million, mandates that 40% of Hooters Girls be men, and demands that Hooters provide scholarships and sensitivity training to benefit men.  What country are we living in? </P>

<P>	Some people support the EEOC's ruling, some would leaveHooters alone, and others would simply wipe Hooters and its 13,000 employees off the map for its insult to politically correct sensitivities.  Ironically, regardless of one's feelings about Hooters, the EEOC is doing a great disservice to everyone.  Here's how.</P>

<P>	EEOC rulings penalize Hooters.  Hooters responds by rejecting the EEOC determination that they are merely a restaurant.  Hooters asserts, and is prepared to vigorously defend, that their primary mission is &quot;providing vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;  The EEOC transforms the food and drink into side dishes.  The Hooters Girls must be the main attraction.  Only then can Hooters justify its hiring practice.</P>

<P>	That's Hooters' escape route.  When the EEOC forbids Hooters Girls from using sex appeal to sell food, then Hooters must prove that they are using sex appeal to sell sex.  The EEOC transforms Hooters from a gimmicky restaurant into a flesh-peddling bar.  The law protects the hiring practice of strip clubs, and Hooters can find sanctuary in that status.</P>

<P>	Thus, as usual, the Nanny State's efforts backfire.  Shielding the prudes and politically correct who cannot tolerate establishments like Hooters pushes Hooters even farther down a scurrilous path that further debases America. </P>

<P>	It is a familiar and predictable result.  Prohibiting some behavior causes perverse and unintended outcomes.  Coercing Hooters to fall into line with the Nanny State's singular vision of how to serve beer will do two things: (1) rob a great many people of benefits as employees, managers, and customers of Hooters; and (2) force Hooters to make selling sex its first priority.  </P>

<P>	The EEOC and the Nanny State would do well to learn an important lesson from the queen of all nannies, Mary Poppins, who sang, &quot;Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot;  Incentives make the unpalatable palatable.  This is how Hooters uses Hooter Girls to make their burgers and wings appetizing.  In the restaurant business, as in the environmental business, market forces encourage entrepreneurs to innovate enterprises that meet the market test.  Whereas coercion is counterproductive, we should recognize that market incentives often provide the best means to coordinate social actions.  Even when we find the result distasteful, the result is usually preferable to coercion.</P>

<P>	The fundamental problem with prohibiting Hooters Girls is that people want them and other people want to become them.  The managers support them.  The clientele rewards them with their hard-earned money.  And the Girls clearly prefer this work to other work.  With such powerful advantages, Hooters won't swallow the EEOC's 'medicine' without a fight.  By defying these incentives, the EEOC's command-and-control approach yields harmful and perverse results.  This is evidenced by Hooters' newfound emphasis on &quot;vicarious sexual recreation.&quot;</P>

<P>	Hooters maintains 175 restaurants in 38 states and is growing.  It is no wonder that the EEOC, an artifact of the Nanny State, cannot stand to see success based on individual liberty and sexist behavior.</P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/29/96</P><H1>The predictable perversities of bureaucratic behavior</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>There is a strong tendancy for such organizations to be run for the benefit of those in charge.  This has profound implications for those in the agency and for those they are to serve.  </P>

<P>A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial portion of its budget from transfers.  When the bureaucracy is a government agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent.  I do not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest.  It impairs my viewshed, silts my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities, and lowers the value of my property.  Unfortunately, we have no choice but to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of what is right.  </P>

<P>What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt.  Its programs pay off too many politicians and special intersts to prevent this economically rational and environmentally preferrable outcome.  Unlike Apple Computer, the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist.  So long as their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can mix good deeds with genuine plunder.</P>

<P>Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization.   Most corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers  within the company, e.g. public affairs departments.  These units, however, are rarely if ever dominant.  Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that generate income by selling products to willing buyers.  While research and public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's mission than that of government agencies.  Deviations are constrained by those who watch the bottom line.</P>

<P>This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.  There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.  Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced sense of purpose.  Few organizations have it.</P>

<P>When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies' self-serving tendancies to become more pronounced.  For instance, although both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be more corrupt than the BIA.  Fortunately for their leaders, we will never know.  </P>

<P>Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university parking with that of shopping malls.  In malls, employees, including managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way, inconvenient location.  The decision-makers who determine parking rules find it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.</P>

<P>In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots marked with titles if not names.  Even a former university president, driven from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his preferential parking privileges.  The perfidious president preserved his privileges.</P>

<P>In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and control over resources.  This logic trumps the purpose justifying their creation.  What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the dark and slog through through seven months of Montana slush if those who make the rules are spared these costs?  A mall based on such privilege would soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such pressures.</P>

<P>None of this is surprising.  And it would be as naive to rail against as to protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by politicians.  That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate.  By then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.</P>

<P>In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix.  Ration the parking spaces by price.  People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in a cheap or free area.  Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries.  Truly handicapped individuals can have reserved parking.  I've yet to hear a reasonable objection to this. </P>

<P>Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land?  Such a reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little cost to pay for their privilege.  It was indeed an aberration when Congress made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live.  This too will erode.  For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.  To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.  </P>

<P>This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of <A HREF="http://www.montana.edu">Montana State University</A> in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus parking. </P>

<H1>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P>
<P>
A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P>
Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P>
Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P>

<H1>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>

<P>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>

<P>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P>

<P>
Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>

<P>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>

<P>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle.  
</P>

<P>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P>

<P>
A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>

<P>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>

<P>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.
</P>

When they reach 41st Avenue Northeast, the sidewalk ends. These people then wheel themselves into Sand Point's rush-hour traffic and travel down the street until the sidewalk resumes a block later</P><P>       Officials should know that disabled people live in the nearby Burke Gilman Place's &quot;affordable&quot; housing, which was built on city land. And officials should know that the sidewalk ends. But, not yet competent with sidewalks, they are on to light rail, a megaproject.</P><P>     Public &quot;megaprojects&quot; fail with amazing consistency. The RAND Corporation, a major research institute, studied 52 such projects costing an average of $2.4 billion each. These projects were plagued by cost overruns and delays and about half performed less successfully than intended. Rand's study, the WPPSS fiasco, and Denver International Airport strongly imply that massive public works are prone to overly optimistic planning and duplicity.</P><P>     The Regional Transit Plan's (RTP) proposed light-rail project exemplifies how wishful thinking leads to ineffective and unnecessarily expensive public projects. Even though we want everyone else to take the train, the RTP won't alleviate congestion. It will lure us from more-effective traffic-management strategies. Traffic congestion is an important challenge and we probably will spend large sums to deal with it. But we will sorely regret devoting resources to a light-rail system</P><P>       Although more than $20 billion was spent to build and expand rail systems in 14 cities during the 1980s, the number of people using rail to get to work fell in all but one. Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., have expensive rail systems but have not appreciably diminished congestion. More broadly, trips on public transit (of which light rail is only a fraction) actually declined from 9 percent of overall trips in 1970 to just 5.3 percent in 1990.</P><P>     Light rail is unpopular because, for most people, it is slower and less-convenient than driving. On average, a trip that includes a ride on light rail is half as fast as a trip by car because getting to the station, waiting for a train, transferring to and from buses, and making station stops take lots of time. Rail lacks flexibility, rarely going where people want to go. Rush-hour travel between the suburbs and downtown, the type of commute rail handles best, is declining in importance. Moreover, people often make side trips to shop, exercise, or take children to school. These trips are far less convenient because tracks are rarely laid where people want to go.</P><P>     According to the Regional Transit Authority's own figures, the $6.7 billion RTP will add a mere 37,000 daily rides to public transit. This is far less than 1 percent of all commutes. And most of these rail riders are people who now use buses. Instead of paying the estimated $360,000 per new transit rider, we could pay 220,000 people $2000 per year for 15 years to bike to work. Biking, like transit, is a healthy, nonpolluting method of travel.</P><P>     Mass transit fails because, under current arrangements, drivers can ignore the congestion they impose on others. Even with traffic delays, automobiles offer quick, comfortable, convenient transportation for most people. Many women view their car as &quot;a personal security device.&quot; The time we waste sitting in traffic is outweighed by these advantages. Public transit fails by comparison.</P><P>     Congestion toll pricing, charging drivers a fee that rises and falls depending on how heavily the road is used, is a more-effective traffic-management strategy. Tolls make better use of existing roadways by spreading traffic more evenly over the day, encouraging carpooling and biking, and making mass transit more attractive. Tolls reduce the need for costly road expansions or rail systems. They also save time and gas while reducing pollution.</P><P>     Start by placing tolls at major congestion points such as the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and the Ship Canal Bridge. Automated Vehicle Identification and Electronic Toll Collection systems, already used in Oklahoma, Norway and Texas, eliminate backups at toll booths. Tolls would be higher during rush hour and low or nonexistent when few cars are on the road.</P><P>     Ideally, our taxes will fall as tolls are used to finance road repairs and improvements. But even if taxes don't fall, new, congestion tolls are preferable to paying twice for the RTP: once, building light rail and buying buses, and again building roads to handle the vast increase in traffic that the RTP will do nothing about.</P><P>     Ordinary citizens rarely analyze complex policy proposals. Work, family and friends trump people's interest in policy analysis. But public officials have a duty to choose wisely. Even if well-intentioned, their myopic fixation on light rail will lead to a project that is expensive and seldom alleviates congestion.</P><P>     Our region is blessed with a highly educated and civic-minded populace, hi-tech businesses, and past public-works successes. But these blessings do not change human nature or repeal economic principles. Even with large subsidies and good intentions, light rail won't work as promised. Until we try congestion tolls it is irresponsible to commit to light rail.</P><P>_____________<BR> John A.

Predictions of a timber famine were common among forestry &quot;experts&quot; of the time, especially from Gifford Pinchot, first chief of the Forest Service</P><P>       Pinchot and others correctly noted that timber harvests were far exceeding reforestation, but incorrectly concluded that this was an inherent flaw of private management. The timber famine did not come to pass for two reasons. First, private-sector entrepreneurs anticipated increased timber scarcity and responded with a wide range of innovations. Second, as prices went up, people began to economize on the use of wood.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship is a continual search to preserve or create value in innovative ways. It is what we can expect when property rights are sufficiently secure to justify the risks always involved when trying something new. Experimenting with more productive and ecologically sensitive timber management is an especially risky venture for the time frame is long.</P><P>     Without relatively secure property rights, people think for the near term. Timber famines and short-term management are likely. But, perversely, the Environmental Protection Agency is penalizing entrepreneurs by harassing innovative timber owners. This has the effect of abridging their rights.</P><P>     EPA harassment has recently focused on Simpson Investment Company, a leader in high-yield forestry. I have known people at Simpson for nearly 20 years and have followed their forestry innovations with interest and admiration. In 1988, Simpson began a risky experiment in growing eucalyptus trees on a &quot;fiber farm&quot; near Corning, Calif. Buying 10,000 acres of land in orchard and pasture, Simpson experimented with eucalyptus trees at the edge of that tree's possible range. The chance of failure was high but the potential rewards seemed to merit the risk. Since eucalyptus grows nearly five times faster than native trees, about 500 cubic feet per acre per year, a given plot of land can yield much more fiber for wood pulp than a comparable section of natural forest.</P><P>     There are many benefits to Simpson's experiment. For example, water is conserved by using 7,000 miles of drip irrigation, an approach developed in the deserts of Israel. By planting on land that had been in agriculture for decades, Simpson preserved natural forests.</P><P>     A third benefit is noted by Resources for the Future (RFF), an organization widely respected as the largest and oldest of the natural resource-environmental think tanks. Roger Sedjo, a University of Washington Ph.D., is director of their Forest Economy and Policy Program. His recent paper, &quot;The Global Environmental Effects of Local Logging Cutbacks,&quot; places the environmental consequences of entrepreneurial efforts such as Simpson's Tehama Tree Farm into its larger context.</P><P>     Sedjo notes that international trade in forest products is well-developed. Logging restrictions in one place produce increased logging elsewhere. This is important because logging's environmental impact varies greatly from place to place. Logging old growth or forests with biodiversity or habitat values has more serious environmental effects than logging plantation forests. Sedjo says, &quot;. . . logging in plantation forests is likely to be the most environmentally benign (alternative), especially when these forests are established on former agricultural lands,&quot; exactly the case with Simpson's eucalyptus farms. By increasing the production of plantation forests, Simpson relieves pressures on the natural forests elsewhere.</P><P>     But the EPA chose to ignore Simpson's solid environmental record and the obvious benefits of its California facility. On Jan. 25 and again on Feb. 3, EPA bureaucrats invaded Simpson's premises. Without explanation, they seized privileged documents and threatened to halt the farm's activities. They claimed possible threats to fairy shrimp, a species listed as endangered last November.</P><P>     Though Simpson officials tried to arrange a meeting to determine the cause of EPA's concerns, their efforts were rebuffed. On Feb. 28, Simpson received an administrative order from EPA that may require the company to cease operations at Tehama. Without a single meeting, EPA snuffed a pioneering effort in innovative forestry.</P><P>     This is a tragic, but unsurprising example of the corruption of purpose associated with government bureaucracies. It demonstrates the pathology identified by Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;; bureaucrats single-mindedly carrying the mission of their organization to the point where it does more harm than good.</P><P>     EPA's treatment of Simpson discourages ambitious environmental experiments. Their behavior makes a mockery of EPA's very reason for existence, environmental protection. When we examine this case from a long-term environmental perspective, we understand why the term &quot;bureaucracy&quot; carries such heavy negative baggage.</P><P>     EPA's response to Simpson's experiment gives huge negative incentives to exactly the type of entrepreneurs upon whom our future depends. EPA's actions demonstrate the huge environmental, ethical and economic consequences of giving vast power to government bureaucracies. It would be ironic indeed if the timber famine predicted by the progressives a century ago would finally come to pass due to the arrogance and aggrandizement of their bureaucratic descendants. </P><P>__________<BR>John A.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>5/15/96</P><H1>Fostering a new west that respects old values</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P> New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.  Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives. They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and bring with them an utterly different value system for the land.  A value system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities. </P>

<P>To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation.  They demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values.  Many locals are resentful.   </P>

<P>     Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation and cooperation.  Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard labor that traditional Western jobs require.  And long-time residents need to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers.  Both must recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.   </P>

<P>     Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and values that have long defined the West.  Here's a story from a recent trip to <A HREF="http://www.orst.edu">Oregon State University</A>, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames the debate for me.  I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.</P>

<P>         I used to work in the woods.  Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and Idaho.  I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific Northwest, and  in 1977, I finally got the chance.  On sabbatical leave from my regular university post,  I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State University.  This left plenty of time to work in the woods.   </P>

<P>    Nearly 20 years later  I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a few days of meetings.  Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks and other signs of fundamental change.  While Ramona worked with her fellow academics, I rode my bike.  One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber.  I wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and maintained.  In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner.   Also, I needed a new saw.</P>

<P>     The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.  I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop.  It spent its declining years on our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood.  That's an easy life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.  </P>

<P>Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy.  It's hard-core, a good place to find recipes for spotted owl.  My Lycra was on trespass in corked-boot territory.  Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust was the same.  The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter.  He looked up from his work as I entered.  </P>

<P>     &quot;Hi, Ken,&quot; I said.  &quot;Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around 1977?  Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days a week?  You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd known he was professor.&quot;  I took off my Bolles.</P>

<P>     &quot;Damn! Hi, John.&quot; He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand.  We exchanged news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong reasons.  &quot;With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees,&quot; he said. &quot;Less wood more saws.  Not many pros in the woods anymore.&quot;  He is looking towards  the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years.  The changing values of the new West aren't for Ken.</P>

<P>     &quot;Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out.  Will you send me a new one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me,&quot; I said, &quot;but I have a Visa card.&quot;</P>

<P>     &quot;Hell, don't bother.  Just send me a check when you get home.&quot;</P>

<P>     The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:</P>

<P><CENTER>
LEBANON<BR>
Saw Shop Lebanon,<BR>
Oregon</CENTER></P>

<P>I put it on to finish writing this essay.  And I thought about trust-about how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust.  Twenty years and a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work honorably done. </P>

<P>     I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old.  Trust that comes from working together is high on my list.  Its presence in my own life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.  </P>

<P>	I just returned from the other Washington, the one on the Potomac.  I met with people in think tanks, universities, the federal judiciary, and intellectuals from the Reagan Administration.  A common question was, &quot;are the Republicans in the 104th Congress brain damaged or just cowards?&quot;</P>

<P>	We all wondered what could possess Republicans to blatantly attack three decades of increased environmental sensitivity. Everett Carll Ladd's American Enterprise Institute study demonstrates America's overwhelming sympathy for environmentalism.  How did the Republicans think the public would receive their anti-environmental rhetoric?</P>

<P>	According to Newt Gingrich, Republicans simply miscalculated on the language they used.  And language is very important here.  Republicans were portrayed as &quot;dismantling 25 years of environmental protection&quot; and &quot;rolling back 25 years of environmental laws&quot;.  These are serious accusations.  Fortunately, they contain only a bit of truth.  </P>

<P>	By and large, Republicans, like other normal people, favor environmental protection.  They just don't believe that federal micro-management and intrusive regulations are the best approach.  Their attempts roll back the &quot;laws&quot; were largely misunderstood as attempts to eliminate environmental &quot;protection&quot;.</P>

<P>	Here is a great lesson for voters and elected officials alike:  It is the bureaucratic regulatory approach that voters rejected in 1994, not the environmental goals.  Americans are tired of intrusive, insensitive, and inefficient bureaucratic means to environmental ends.  Almost everybody favors environmental protection; the big difference is in how we achieve it.  </P>

<P>	Most of the new Republicans arrived in Washington not hoping to destroy our environment, but rather to transform the process and preserve it from the corruption, waste, and politicking inherent to Washington D.C.  Their deregulatory, limited-government approach contrasted sharply with the traditional environmentalist agenda of greater bureaucratic powers, increased federal control, and heightened paranoia over environmental problems.  </P>

<P>	This reform required fewer stringent environmental regulations and far more freedom to find new ways to achieve environmental goals.  &quot;Green&quot; groups took this as an attack.  Since the first Earth Day most environmental groups have relied on the heavy hand of federal management, detailed regulations, and larger subsidies.</P>

<P>	Reform demanded that Republicans confront orthodox command-and-control environmentalism.  However, extreme spokespeople like Don Young of Alaska and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho undermine the credibility of their reform.  They and their &quot;Wise Use&quot; constituents paraded under the banner of free enterprise while demanding a continuation of subsidies for outmoded, environmentally destructive exploitation of resources on public lands.  The other Republicans were either ignorant of the damages and distortions of subsidies or too cowardly to stand up against the outspoken, but misguided, representatives of Wise Use.</P>

<P>	While the Republican agenda presented several innovative ways to better the environment (like property rights protections and Superfund reform), they failed to provide a cohesive and mature vision for environmental protection.  According to Lynn Scarlett, Vice President of Research at the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, &quot;Would-be reformers adopted a mirror image of their opponents' technocratic, top-down approach without thinking seriously about how to ensure environmental protection.&quot;  For example, mandatory cost-benefit analyses can make regulations more efficient, but they do not address the fundamental shortcomings of the regulatory approach. </P>

<P>	Conventional environmentalism overstepped its bounds through excessive regulations, uncompensated &quot;takings&quot;, and centralized control.  It has imposed unnecessary costs on everyone and pitted the environment against prosperity, rather than harmonizing these two complementary values.</P>

<P>	Some environmental gains were well worth the costs.  But their means neglected what economists call &quot;diminishing marginal returns&quot;.  Ever increasing environmental regulation ultimately costs society more than it benefits.  In <CITE>Breaking the Vicious Circle</CITE>, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer identifies the rising costs of regulations like CAFE fuel economy requirements, EPA restrictions on benzene, and Superfund.</P>

<P>	Inflexible and exorbitantly expensive regulations are predictable consequences of separating power from responsibility.  When pollution is free to polluters, we get too much pollution.  Likewise, when regulations are free to the regulators, we get too much regulation.  But it's irresponsible to ignore trade-offs inherent in every policy.  Pursuing environmental goals with what Justice Breyer calls &quot;tunnel vision&quot; will squander billions of dollars.  This process will also trample individuals, communities, and even endangered species.  </P>

<P>	The high costs and ineffectiveness precipitated the voters' demand for fundamental changes.  The Republicans of the 104th Congress are indeed cowards if they ultimately accept a milder, more gentle orthodox environmentalism or continue the old, pork-barrel subsidies.  They also seem dim-witted when they fail to articulate an alternative environmental vision based on sound science, positive incentives, regulatory stability, responsibility, and secure property rights.</P>

<P>	Some political entrepreneur, Democrat, Libertarian, or Republican, will catalyze a new era of environmentalism -- a new shade of green.  Taking control away from bureaucracies and their advocates (be they industry or environmentalist) means allowing flexible adaptation to govern environmental stewardship.  The Nature Conservancy demonstrates flexible, innovative responses to Americans' demands for stewardship.  TNC has successfully tripled the acres it protects in the last 10 years by stressing its decentralized, local approach.  </P>

<P>	Features which characterize ecological systems, such as evolution, decentralization, and adaptability, can guide policy reform.  Ecological systems are much like economic systems.  Shared principles provide the key for a new environmental vision. The Republicans just haven't found it.  They must find courage to begin looking and exercise wisdom to use this key.</P>

<P>	Economic analysis can promote environmental quality.  By identifying subsidies, inefficiencies, and new opportunities, economists apply their powerful analytical tools to environmental ends. </P>

<P>	Yet despite its great potential, economic analysis has failed to improve environmental policy in many areas.  Environmental regulators often ignore the importance of secure property rights and advocate regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of property with predictable and oft perverse consequences.  The Progressives of the early 20th Century, who established the federal land management bureaucracies, completely failed to understand why America's founders were so skeptical of activist, intrusive government.  The persistent failures of bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management illustrate the founders' wisdom.  And too often American ideals of limited government are ignored by agencies and special interests, both of whom gain through wasteful central planning that corrupts good intentions.</P>

<P>	Economists have failed to deliver their message because they are neither naturally inclined nor trained to communicate with intelligent non-specialists.  The language of economists, calculus and econometrics, are alien to most people.  Even when economists share environmental goals and interests with conventional greens, their message is unheard or misinterpretted.</P>

<P>	This communication gap between economists, environmental activists, and decision-makers inspired a new organization, the Gallatin Institute.  This non-profit, educational and research foundation links essayists, poets, and novelists with economists and policy analysts interested in environmental quality and sensitive to an emerging environmentalist culture.  Gallatin works with these purveyors of culture to forge innovative cultural and intellectual foundations for an emerging West.  </P>

<P>	Shared goals of sustainable economies, ecologies, and cultures would be at the heart of such a New West.  To get there, Gallatin first fosters exchange between writers and policy experts. Gallatin Fellows next take these messages to communities.  </P>

<P>	Environmental concerns increasingly affect the West.  Technically complex and highly emotional, they often pit ecological against other human values.  These ingredients for error and acrimony provide opportunities for demagogues to work their mischief.  Lies go undetected, truths untold, opportuism fostered.</P>

<P>	In pursuit of ecological integrity and viable economies, Gallatin Fellows respect the ideals of free and responsible individuals, the importance of community, and the value of voluntary cooperative actions. They agree productive and just economic and social coordination is rarely achieved through force, and never by fraud.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute develops thoughtful foundations for constructive policy reform.  With support from the Ford Foundation and others, Gallatin hosts working conferences and seminars and provides modest support for writers to produce popular and scholarly articles and books.  Its varied ideas and proposals respectfully recognize differing cultures and traditions of the old while articulating a vision for a new West. </P>

<P>	When a group of writers met some years back, they envisioned a West moving away from federal dependency, factious division, and unsustainable land use.  The Gallatin Institute emerged as one vehicle for ushering in a new West.  Its aim is not to provide &quot;the answer&quot; for the New West.  Rather, Gallatin promotes an ecumenical, constructive dialogue among leaders of rural communities, Western writers, and policy analysts.  Gallatin recognizes that the West must determine its own identity, its own future.</P>

<P>	The Institute's emphasis on fostering harmony and responsibility reflects its namesake, Albert Gallatin, the secretary of the treasury under Thomas Jefferson.  Albert Gallatin had coherent and yet diverse interests.  A fiscal conservative, he stressed simple government and ending public debt.  In spite of the Louisiana Purchase and preparations for the War of 1812, Gallatin cut the federal debt by 38% in eight years.  He strongly opposed war and was instrumental in negotiating peace with Britain.  Gallatin funded the Lewis and Clark expedition and founded New York University and the American Ethnological Society.  Like its namesake, Gallatin Institute fosters constructive and peaceful exchange to find a new identity in the West, based on responsibility, cultural and ecological harmony, and self-governance.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute brings eclectic writings to the media and general public through several avenues.  A new<CITE> Gallatin Journal</CITE>, based on writings brought to seminars and community gatherings, will be launched in mid-1996.  Two forthcoming Gallatin books, <CITE>The Next West</CITE> and <CITE>Writers on the Range</CITE>, were generated by the seminars.</P>

<P>	A series of op-ed pieces are published in local, regional, and national print and electronic media are produced by the Institute.  Under the banners of &quot;Range Writers&quot; and &quot;Writers on the Range&quot;, Gallatin's writers produce columns and articles to promote this dialogue in the West.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute is one of many examples of environmental entrepreneurship in action, this one in the intellectual arena.  The Institute recognizes the important morality, ethics, and the analytic power of economics to explore an emerging West.  When writers begin using the potent tools of economic analysis, and if even a few economists return to their ethical/moral roots in Moral Philosophy, then the 21st century will yield a West whose public policies equal the quality of its scenery.  For once, I am not keeping my hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P>

<H1>Finding Defenses Against Parasitic Bureaucracies</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>More young Americans believe in UFOs than believe they'll receive Social Security.  Only 25% of Americans trust the federal government.  30 years ago it was 75%.  No wonder -- the federal government now runs trillion-dollar deficits, dedicates 15% of its budget to pay interest on the national debt, and spends two-thirds of what remains on entitlements programs.  One entitlement to <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa241es.html">Archer Daniels Midland Co.</A>, the nation's leading ethanol producer, costs taxpayers $30 for every $1 of ADM profits.  </P>

<P>Behavioral ecology helps explain these findings.  Governments become parasitic; they get their hooks into and drain productive individuals and groups.  </P>

<P>The authors of the U.S. Constitution well understood the problems of political parasitism.  They knew that the default position is for government to become a parasitic agent that feeds off involuntary hosts without providing commensurate benefits.  Constant vigilance is required to forestall this outcome.</P>

<P>Our government is a social arrangement legitimized by the consent of the governed.  The constitution sets the rules for making laws and regulations.  Citizens sacrifice certain rights to guarantee predictable, social order.</P>

<P>In principle, nearly all sane people find these sacrifices preferable to anarchy.  It makes little difference whether we drive on the right or left side of the road, as long as we all drive on the same side.  Having government select and enforce one side benefits society immensely at little cost.  In many ways, great and subtle, government is a social lubricant.  </P>

<P>But there is a profound tension inherent to political management.  The key social lubricant, government, is also the ultimate source of coercion.  Government can make life easier by establishing courts and minting currency, but can it stop there?  </P>

<P>When government becomes the Welfare and Nanny State its major functions are to redistribute wealth and opportunities.  Government bureaucracies generate no wealth on their own.  Unlike private, independent actors who must rely on mutually beneficial, voluntary agreements, federal bureaucracies depend on taxation and forced transfers.  Their lifeblood is siphoned from successful individuals and organizations.  There are huge temptations for government to expand its activities and become an economic parasite.</P>

<P>Michael Rothschild, in his book <A HREF="http://www.bionomics.org/text/resource/biobook.html"><CITE>Bionomics</CITE></A>, describes economic parasites as organisms that &quot;use secrecy, deception, brute force, and legal authority as their 'hooks'.&quot;  No doubt active government agencies use all of the above tactics, some more than others.  The <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us">U.S. Forest Service</A>, quietly loses a billion dollars a year managing lands it got for free.  It relies on an oblivious public who loves Smokey but is largely ignorant of how Forest Service operations deplete our forests, divide our communities, and depreciate our economies.</P>

<P>Federal subsidies to ethanol producers, championed by Bob Dole (&quot;Senator Ethanol&quot;, according to his own press release), are predicated on the deception that they save energy and improve air quality.  They epitomize corporate welfare and gross economic inefficiencies.  The <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov">Fish and Wildlife Service</A>, in forcing landowners to provide habitat for endangered species, is one of many agencies who implement brute force as its hook.  These parasitic agencies drain their host (taxpayers, landowners) usually without their consent.</P>

<P>Society needs defenses against parasites, just as our bodies do.  When economic parasitism comes from criminals, government is expected (and funded by taxes) to intervene.  What happens when government IS the economic parasite?  The Founders' question, &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; (who will monitor the monitors themselves) has no satisfactory answer.</P>

<P>Behavioral ecology can offer great insight here.  Humans, their pets, fruits, and other organisms have been plagued by parasites throughout history.  Society has devised many treatments to mitigate harm, especially when cures are not available.</P>

<P>Traditional treatments often include some form of quarantine.  Parasites need a host.  By isolating parasites from potential new hosts, the parasite will eventually die.  Quarantining fruits, pets, and the infirmed is an example of this.  Similarly, the Bubonic Plague was tackled by implementing waste management practices which separated rat habitat from human habitat.</P>

<P>Successes against biological parasites can be translated to political economy.  Imprisoning criminals effectively quarantines them.  Likewise, by quarantining an activist, parasitic government, its many bureaucratic tentacles will wither.  </P>

<P>This is what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind:  a limited government, based on a system of checks and balances and a Bill of Rights which protects individuals and states from incursions of a parasitic Big Government.  The limited, quarantined government could still do its essentials (like protect from invasions and select which side of the road to drive on), but couldn't engage in the parasitic behavior that is epidemic today.</P>

<P>Free speech and press are essential to stopping parasitism by secrecy and deception.  &quot;Just compensation&quot; and the Fifth Amendment prohibition on forcing citizens to house soldiers during wartime are examples of efforts to prevent parasitism of a police state.  And the Tenth Amendment's oft-neglected mandate that &quot; powers not delegated to the United States... are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people&quot; was meant to curtail parasitism of a totalitarian government.</P>

<P>The Constitution was designed to be our first line of defense against economic parasitism.  Yet today we see generalized disenchantment with both major parties.  This is a predictable consequence of parasitic government.  And the costs of lost efficiency are small when compared to those of lost civic virtue among national politicians.  We will not see faith restored in federal government while it's used as an engine of plunder. </P>

BADEN</P><P>            THE debate over old-growth forests pits preservationists against those depending on this timber for their livelihood. With each side committed to different uses of nature, conflict seems inevitable, for not all good things go together.</P><P>       This conflict is heightened by public ownership and political control. Special-interest groups are special precisely because they focus on their narrow interests, ignoring other costs and foregone opportunities to use or appreciate the land. If we are to resolve the old-growth conflict, we need to give people incentives to consider the preferences and tastes of others.</P><P>     Instead of continuing the failed, special-interest-dominated political management of old growth in national forests, consider what would happen if we gave the old growth to various environmental groups, e.g., the Sierra Club and Wilderness Society. This radical proposal would remove the forests from governmental politics and present the new land managers with strong incentives to preserve the values of old growth at the lowest possible cost.</P><P>     Let's consider such a transfer to be a real possibility.</P><P> Transferring ownership of old-growth areas to nonprofit corporations safeguards natural beauty and species diversity while offering opportunities for appropriate economic or recreational use. Unlike rangers and supervisors in the National Forests, private managers can balance these competing goods uninhibited by federal bureaucracies. Nonprofit managers will reap more of the benefits of good policies and bear more of the consequences of bad choices than do federal bureaucrats.</P><P>     If private owners damage a beautiful area by allowing destructive economic activities they will lose the aesthetic appeal of their land and the potential revenues from donors or recreational users. But if they choose to leave valuable natural resources untouched they must accept the loss of revenue that entails. Smoky's helpers are insulated from both losses.</P><P>     Many economic and recreational activities have little or no long-term environmental impact. Environmentally sensitive owners can choose these activities and generate revenue even as they regard nature. The Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary illustrates how private management follows these principles to harmonize conflicts among economic and ecological values.</P><P>     Rainey, a 26,800-acre marsh found near Intracoastal City, La., is owned by the Audubon Society and run for the benefit of the species it protects. What distinguishes Rainey from federal sanctuaries is the harmonious coexistence among wildlife, oil- and gas-drilling operations, and cattle grazing. Why does this work? Private management and sound science insulate managers from political processes that cause mischief on federal lands.</P><P>     Although oil wells and cattle are not usually associated with wildlife sanctuaries, at Rainey their presence makes sense. Royalties from oil and grazing fees from cattle provide Audubon revenue for operations, land acquisitions or improvements in existing land holdings.</P><P>     Drilling and grazing complement wildlife habitat on the preserve for two reasons. First, Rainey's managers seek to minimize environmental damage through restrictions on drilling during nesting seasons. Using careful timing, grazing, a notorious threat to wildlife on public lands, is an ecological tool. Second, those who wish to graze or drill have incentives to offer environmental sensitivity as well as high bids. In Rainey we see ecological entrepreneurship in action. Let's foster such innovations in the old growth of the national forests.</P><P>     Private, nonprofit land ownership avoids widespread subsidies to unprofitable logging, mining, and grazing. It is these subsidies that have created the West's most painful ecological disasters. Private ownership readily adapts to different times and places with innovative management techniques. For example, Rainey uses controlled burning to encourage growth of three-cornered grass that (snow) geese relish - a technique long disfavored on government lands. Finally, private ownership reduces the influence of perverse incentives leading to bureaucratic budgets, political vote buying, and time and money wasted on inconclusive political and legal battles.</P><P>     A lasting solution to the old-growth dilemma will require more than good intentions, lofty rhetoric, and admonitions for mutual respect. It will require shifting the management of environmental resources from public bureaucrats to private, often nonprofit, decision-makers. Political management inevitably makes policy the captive of special interests and science subject to politics. It gives bureaucracies license to mismanage, waste, and serve their perverse institutional goals.</P><P>     As a modest experiment, let's transfer 20 percent of the federal old growth to the environmental groups. They are far more likely than bureaucrats and politicians to find ways to make good things like prosperity and environmental quality go together.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           THERE is much talk today about &quot;reinventing government.&quot; The goal is to both improve outcomes and save dollars. The Forest Service is an excellent candidate for such reforms.  </P><P>      The Forest Service's creators are credited with high ideals, but America's sylvan socialism has suffered the liabilities of socialism elsewhere. The Forest Service was created because of an expectation of timber famine. Since then, the Forest Service has predicted five timber famines (which have yet to materialize) and used these threats to expand its prominence, power and funding.</P><P>     And while it is true that there is a scarcity of undisturbed ecosystems, there is no scarcity of wood fiber. There are three reasons why. First, the U.S. began with a huge inventory of mature timber for harvest at low cost. Second, the private sector manages productive timber sites well. Third, we've had great technical innovation. When dealing with commodities in a market economy, scarcity has yet to win a race against creativity.</P><P>     In sum, the Forest Service is not, and has never been, essential to a secure timber supply. It was a well-intended but misguided response to both real and imagined problems.</P><P>     Forest Service reform can serve two purposes: to increase the ecological sensitivity with which the land is treated and to increase the efficiency with which the forests are managed. Forest Service atrocities have been documented in detail: streams silted up, giant sequoias leveled, habitat destroyed, billions of dollars wasted. Years of reform attempts have had no great effect. The Forest Service's size and the bureaucratic imperative of budgetary growth have thwarted attempts to induce fiscal or environmental responsibility.</P><P>     We want our most productive national forests to be as efficient as private commercial forests while respecting environmental values. To achieve these ends we suggest nothing radical. Rather, to reinvent those national forests best suited to commercial timber, we should carefully and with environmental sensitivity sell them to the highest bidders over a 20-year period. Here's how.</P><P>     Our national forests fall into three categories: productive commercial forests, inherently unproductive forests on high, dry, and cold sites, and those forests which, depending upon technology and timber prices, fall somewhere in between.</P><P>     Trees like to grow where it is warm, wet and low. These are the most productive forests, suitable for commercial timber. Few of our 122 national forests, perhaps one-third at most, have these features. The Forest Service runs them essentially as commercial forests. They are roaded. They have been logged and are on harvest rotations. They are distinguished from private forests largely by inefficiency and the political influence on management. These lands are candidates for sale.</P><P>     Incentives to produce timber efficiently and cheaply are far stronger in the private sector than in the government sector. And deed restrictions can ensure that the environmental values of these lands are better protected than on either traditional private forests or the national forests.</P><P>     For example, riparian areas can be protected by buffer zones. Conservation easements can provide recreation areas. Restrictive covenants can protect against commercial development. Ecologically critical areas, such as elk calving grounds, can also be protected through deed restrictions.</P><P>     Companies like Champion International might manage such lands. Such firms know how to grow trees efficiently and effectively. Firms like Champion also have experience managing land for both recreation and timber. In Western Washington, they manage lands to increase deer habitat. This has resulted in both healthy deer herds and profitable timber. The lands are also managed for recreationalists who pay modest fees for access.</P><P>     Private ownership is no panacea. There is no one perfect system and no costless solution. We seek arrangements in which individuals have incentives to act in the public interest. The system we propose fosters recreation and aesthetic uses of the land and efficient timber production.</P><P>     And importantly, the taxpayer will no longer be forced to pay for poor Forest Service management practices. The financial responsibility would be with taxpaying timber companies while opportunities for political meddling and pork-barrel politics are reduced. Such conjunctions of sound economics and ecological stewardship can be a basis for &quot;reinventing government.&quot;</P><P>____________</P><P> John A.

<P>	Beneath Greater Yellowstone, powerful thermal energies relentlessly shift tectonic plates.  The subsurface motion creates rifts and faults, occasionally volcanoes and earthquakes.  The fundamental tensions are always there.</P>

<P>	The tectonic plates of culture and political economy are also shifting and generating profound tensions in the new American West.  In Oregon and Idaho, hi-tech industries now provide more jobs than wood products industries.  In Washington, 4,900 lost timber jobs were replaced by three times as many software jobs.  As standing trees become more valuable than logs, it is apparent that values are evolving. Different cultures, polities, and economies collide, occasionally with catastrophic results.  The Yellowstone wolf reintroduction illustrates these changes.</P>

<P>	The wolf is mediagenic, an icon of the changing West.  But icons have varying interpretations.  Those insulated from rural traditions see the wolves as displaced natives who must be returned to the ecosystem. The wolf icon combines their romantic vision of an untamed past with a feel-good mission to set things right.  Conversely, many native Westerners view wolf reintroduction as the imposition of an alien culture that threatens ranching and the traditional economy.</P>

<P>	These traditional interests prompted the National Park Service to exterminate the wolf from Yellowstone in the 1920s.  Now, another federal agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is charged with undoing that misguided &quot;progress&quot;.  However, the imported wolves don't easily coexist with local ranchers and hunters.</P>

<P>	Montanan Chad McKittrick, an unemployed carpenter, just received a six-month sentence in the slammer for killing &quot;Alpha One&quot;, a reintroduced wolf.  The U.S. Magistrate called the shooting, &quot;an intentional, thrill-seeking act in direct violation of the law.&quot;  McKittrick boasted a T-shirt saying &quot;Northern Rockies Wolf Reduction Project&quot;.  In the battle over the wolf icon, some locals in Montana made McKittrick a hero.</P>

<P>	When Park Rangers exterminated wolves Yellowstone lost a key component of its ecosystem.  Since then our ecological knowledge and sensitivity have increased while ranchers' economic and social influence have waned.  New people and interests are colonizing the West.   Nike, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard are moving in.</P>

<P>	Loggers, farmers, fishermen, and miners feel their industries wither.  8,000 logging jobs are expected to disappear from the region in the next two years.  Despite this, the Pacific Northwest has led the nation in new job creation based on a diversifying economy and high quality of life.  In many National Forests, standing trees have greater value than decked logs.  Progressive-era bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Park Service, however, are caught on the fault line between amenity and commodity interests.  Federal agencies cannot manage to the mounting tensions.</P>

<P>	In Oregon, environmentalists chain themselves to trees to stop logging.  But loggers, whose wages have fallen 22% since 1978, miss that income.  In Nevada, a state comprised of 87% federal lands, counties are suing feds for control.  In Idaho, militia concoct conspiracy theories linking federal agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife Service with the U.N. and a New World Order.  </P>

<P>	Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho describes the friction between the traditional West and &quot;a government-sponsored religion&quot; based upon &quot;New Age mysticism, Native American folklore, and primitive Earth worship.&quot;  She sees an invaded West, where &quot;Easterners dream of preserving it, but in the process they're driving our people off the land.&quot;  The Yellowstone wolf symbolizes this conflict.</P>

<P>	Elsewhere, wolves are quietly and naturally recolonizing their former ranges in the Glacier National Park region of Montana.  The Glacier wolf has rapidly proliferated.  Why don't Glacier's wolves attract the same attention, debate, and tension as Yellowstone's?</P>

<P>	The difference between Yellowstone and Glacier is one of means.  The wolves naturally recolonized Glacier, following their food source.  Cut-over forests with booming deer populations are excellent wolf habitat.  These wolves have learned to survive near man.  The wolves that kill livestock are shot.  Vigilant ranchers with rifles provide an evolutionary filter which selects out wolves that won't adapt to man, the supreme predator.</P>

<P>	In contrast, the Yellowstone wolves were caught in the wild, caged, drugged, and then airlifted into the Park.  Federal &quot;caretakers&quot; short circuited the adaptive process.  The transplanted wolves lacked the &quot;training&quot; to coexist with ranchers.  They're not passed through the filters of accommodation with people.  Predictably, Yellowstone wolves are more troublesome than those in Glacier.  The Yellowstone reintroduction may still succeed, but it will be costly in terms of dead wolves, dead livestock, taxpayer money, and cultural conflict between new and old interests.</P>

<P>	The cultural tectonic plates have shifted from 70 years ago when Westerners demanded wolf extermination and the government complied.  Old, native values are undergoing a process geologists call &quot;subduction&quot;.  As one tectonic plate submerges below another, it quietly heats up and eventually returns to the surface through volcanic eruption.  If we are not careful, the &quot;subducted&quot; traditional political economy might one day erupt as it did with Chad McKittrick.  The consequences preclude a harmonious West.</P>

<P>	Long ago, Progressives believed that federal government would foster community harmony.  Instead, it has fueled passions and amplified conflicts near Yellowstone.  And if we're not careful, rare bumper-stickers like &quot;Wolves: Gut Shoot 'Em At The Border!&quot;  and &quot;Hungry And Out Of Work?  Eat An Environmentalist&quot; will become as common as gun racks. </P>

Her work launched America's modern environmental movement and set the stage for the Earth Day celebration of 1970</P><P>       On April 10, 1995, just a few days short of the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, Greg Easterbrook published an article in the same New Yorker. Distilled from his recent book, &quot;A Moment upon the Earth,&quot; the article focuses on &quot;eco-realism.&quot; Easterbrook convincingly argues that we have greatly improved our environment since Earth Day, though few are ready to admit it.</P><P>     Many fiscal conservatives, free-market aficionados and libertarians are unwilling to recognize our successes. They resist evidence that government programs are sometimes effective (though rarely efficient). Many modern liberals are reluctant to admit even partial victory. Some fear a relaxation of effort while others seek to profit by perpetuating the perception of crisis. Nevertheless, the gains are real.</P><P>     Lake Washington, Puget Sound, Lake Erie, and many other bodies of water have made ecological comebacks. Airborne lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and automobile hydrocarbon emissions have declined from 24 percent to 96 percent, significantly improving air quality in America's cities. Some wildlife populations have rebounded. For example, the wild turkey, an important indicator species, was nearly extinct but is now more widely distributed than in colonial times.</P><P>     Other environmental improvements have occurred without federal encouragement. The Atlantic Monthly's April feature story discussed the impressive and ongoing reforestation of the eastern United States. The much-maligned profit motive has spurred private enterprise to reduce consumption of natural resources and lower the generation of solid and toxic waste. And in the 1980s, private land trusts exploded as an important, local method for preserving millions of acres of land.</P><P>     In spite of its successes, the post-Earth Day legacy of environmental protection has serious flaws. It emphasized rigid federal laws and regulations that are often monstrously inefficient and massively inequitable. The inefficiency, by wasting resources, means environmental protection is more likely to conflict with other important goals, especially when government budgets are tightening. Inequity, by imposing costs on a small number of people, encourages heated resistance to programs that are supposed to pursue worthwhile goals. For example, opposition to the Endangered Species Act continues to grow because the costs of species protection are concentrated on relatively few land owners.</P><P>     Until recently, inefficiency and inequity were of little concern to single-minded seekers of environmental quality.</P><P>     This is partly because we could achieve large gains in environmental quality for relatively little time, money, and inconvenience. But, as America grows cleaner, easy gains become more elusive. In economists' parlance, we encounter the problem of diminishing marginal returns. The next 5 percent of a specific environmental gain may cost more than the first 90 percent, the next 2 percent more than the previous 95 percent. Opportunity costs grow as we seek ever deepening shades of green.</P><P>     In addition, environmental regulations often hide regulatory costs by placing them on businesses, and letting the businesses pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. With the public largely unaware of the monetary and social costs of environmental regulations, lawmakers and bureaucrats have little reason to worry about efficiency or equity.</P><P>     Public indifference is complemented by political self-seeking and opportunism. Bureaucrats at EPA, OSHA and FDA, whose jobs depend on regulating even trivial or nonexistent risks, have powerful incentives to cast an ever wider net of ever tighter regulations, just to keep their people working and their budgets growing.</P><P>     Legislators impede our movement toward environmental quality by carving out protections for powerful constituencies. For example, the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments required smokestack scrubbers be installed at many coal-burning power plants rather than promoting low-sulfur coal. Scrubbers were chosen even though they did little for air quality because the use of low sulfur coal would have harmed eastern coal miners and the political careers of their congressmen.</P><P>     Finally, many private environmentalists must share the blame for our misguided approach to environmental protection. They seek regulations that promote their narrow interests, frequently by foisting costs on less-organized or less-politically powerful groups. Public monies and state coercion are used to promote private or organizational interests at the expense of the public good.</P><P>     Greenpeace, for example, has made efforts to restrict the industrial use of chlorine compounds, a class of substances very useful in a broad array of manufactures (which in turn contribute to America's health and welfare). Other organizations have supported legislation, such as log-export bans, that dramatically reduce property values and alienate the people who can best promote conservation.</P><P>     As additional increments of environmental quality become more expensive and the costs of these increments become more visible, public resistance will stiffen. For example, the rise of the Wise Use movement partially reflects legitimate concerns with the concentration of environmental costs on rural landowners.</P><P>     Much progress has been made since Earth Day 1970. But the easy solutions are behind us. To continue to improve our environment we must consider how we can minimize the burdens we impose on ordinary citizens as we pursue necessary environmental goals. This is the challenge for our next 25 years.</P><P>_______<BR> John A.

I end my career with the course I began 25 years ago at Indiana University, The Political Economy of Environmental Policy. Throughout my career, I have advocated environmental policies based on incentives, not commands  </P><P>      I helped create an environmental paradigm that views economies as ecosystems. Both adapt to changing conditions and widely dispersed information. Both involve complex webs of individuals linked into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. My approach is an alternative to the traditional green model, which assumes that if we only love nature enough, select good managers, and give them enough authority, we can protect our environment. The traditional model is fatally flawed. When people set out to govern by love, they end by ruling through force and fear.</P><P>     While environmental values are important guides for behavior, I stress the importance of information, incentives and institutional design. These are the pillars of a new field of political economy, the New Resource Economics (NRE).</P><P>     The NRE approach emphasizes property rights, market incentives and the constructive potential of voluntary cooperation. These concepts help us understand how economic progress can be harmonized with liberty and environmental quality. The NRE's strong ethical and philosophical foundations build on the classical liberal ideals of America's founders, especially Jefferson and Madison.</P><P>     The NRE draws heavily on the analytic leverage of microeconomic theory leavened with Austrian economics, public-choice economics, and property-rights theory. Taken together, these schools of thought yield several general principles for environmental management:</P><P>       1. Liberty and individual responsibility are fundamental to a constructive and harmonious social order. Social order fosters prosperity, and since demand for environmental quality increases with wealth, environmentalists have a stake in promoting prosperity.</P><P>     2. There is no one perfect system for economic and social coordination. Markets, governments and private nonprofit organizations each have predictable benefits and flaws. When advocating specific environmental reforms, we should consider each of these systems, focusing upon the information and incentives each produces.</P><P>     3. Economies are like ecosystems. The most basic law of each states that everything is interrelated: It is impossible to do just one thing. In economies as in ecosystems, human actions have effects beyond those intended.</P><P>     4. Individuals are self-interested. When evaluating a decision, they first ask: &quot;How will this decision affect me and the things I value?&quot; The welfare of others, especially relatives and friends, is normally considered, but self-interest influences perceptions of problems, alternatives, and solutions.</P><P>     5. Incentives influence decisions. Individuals weigh the relative costs and benefits of competing alternatives. As the costs to the decision-maker of choosing a particular option increase, that option becomes less attractive.</P><P>     6. Decision-makers generally conserve only the resources over which they have control and for which they face responsibility. When the decision-maker is insulated from the costs of his/her actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems usually follow. For example, when pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced, and when regulations are free to the regulator, they too are overproduced.</P><P>     7. Information is costly in terms of time, effort and money. Individuals stop acquiring additional information when its expected value is less than the burden of acquisition. Hence, voters are relatively ill-informed about most policy issues. To the individual, both the costs of ignorance and benefits of knowledge are lower in public than in private decisions.</P><P>     8. Legal and economic institutions differ greatly in the quality of information and type of incentives they generate. When institutions hold individuals accountable for their actions, economic progress and environmental quality are complements, not competitors.</P><P>     9. Increases in efficiency give us greater value from equal or fewer resources. Otherwise, nothing of value is free. For example, to have wilderness areas we give up the opportunity for development. Although I often find this &quot;trade-off&quot; worthwhile, it is intellectually irresponsible to deny that opportunities are forgone when we declare a parcel of land to be wilderness.</P><P>     10. Scarce goods must be rationed and the rationing system we select affects the amount there is to ration. This is why institutional design is so important. Political allocation exacerbates scarcity while eroding ethics. Markets economize on love and goodwill while fostering efficiency.</P><P>      As Aldo Leopold explained in &quot;The Land Ethic,&quot; environmental values are important. But values and good intentions will not suffice. When considering reform, focus on the information and incentives generated by the proposed institutions. In the policy arena, an understanding of political economy is indispensable in achieving our environmental goals.</P><P>_______________<BR>  John A.

Baden</P><P>    	Markets economize on love, that most precious of values.  They encourage cooperation and civility among disparate people.  This was one of the great lessons of Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who was founding editor of <CITE>The Journal of Conflict Resolution</CITE>.  Boulding developed the concept of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; with the understanding that we're all in this together. </P><P>   	We should cherish social arrangements which foster harmony and inhibit conflict without requiring that people love one another.  The ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, terrorism in the Mid-East, and discord in Canada are powerful reminders of perennial conflict among groups with differing values and goals.</P><P>    	While markets favor efficiency and profits, they also encourage diverse people to interact harmoniously.  They promote civil, coordinated, and constructive social order.  Here's a homey example.</P><P>    	Bozeman, Montana, a town with 30,000 people, has several supermarkets.  Each offers valuable lessons.  Although I shop them all, I know best the Albertson's by my office.  It has tens of thousands of different items.  There is evolutionary competition among stores, among brands within each store, and among products within individual brands.  And between Albertson's and Safeway is the Community Food Co-op which offers an alternative blend of exotics and local, organic products.</P><P>    	These stores compete with differing mixes of service, economy, and products.  Even the check-out lines vary in lengths and degree of service.  Each grocer behaves as though he cares while seeking consumers with varying income, interests, and values.  </P><P>    	Consumer preferences are continuously monitored at the check-out line.  As clerks scan the products, consumer preferences are entered into the store's computer which adjusts inventory and orders.  With their purchases consumers elect the stores and product lines they find most attractive. </P><P>    	Among stores and within stores, winners are determined by voluntary transactions.  The losers gradually lose shelf space.  Ultimately they either improve their products' appeal or disappear.  The consumer really is sovereign.  The market registers consumer preference and automatically adjusts to harmoniously reconcile changing demands with new supplies.</P><P>    	This process is quite remarkable.  It demonstrates that, at root, the market is a social arrangement which efficiently generates information about people's wants and reservations while providing incentives to heed disparate, oft conflicting preferences.</P><P>    	Free and open markets offer a setting where each can satisfy his or her wants without imposing their preferences on others.  The market process promotes diversity, freedom of choice, and innovations -- blessings in this imperfect world.  Yet, there is another huge advantage we normally take for granted. </P><P>    	Though market efficiency is marvelous, the harmony fostered by voluntary exchange seems an even greater value, especially as inter-group conflict becomes so significant. </P><P>    	Market exchange by competent individuals, permits people with radically differing views to peacefully coexist.  Like most college towns, Bozeman has many committed vegetarians.  They shop peacefully and amicably with rancher and logger carnitarians, people who eat vegetables only as occasional concessions to health. </P><P>    	Ranchers mingle with Dallas blondes with big hair and Big Sky condos.  Counterculture refugees of the 1960s mix with fun hogs who bounce among Montana's ski slopes, white-water rivers, and mountain trails. Vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists, teetotaling Mormons, and New Age vegans freely intermingle at Albertson's, Safeway, and the Community Co-op.  These markets accomodate the teetotalers', and those for whom dinner implies good wine.  When transactions are voluntary, interactions are peaceful.</P><P>    	Clear private property rights and free exchange foster civility and cooperation.  Coercion doesn't occur with these institutions.  Committed vegetarians and prohibitionists cooperated with those holding antithetical views. </P><P>    	What if grocery store management was political?  Fighting would erupt between vegetarians and carnitarians; teetotalers and Epicureans; organic fanatics who protest pesticides and farmers who use chemicals; populists opposed to corporate agriculture and shareholders in those firms; working parents who want the stores open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and fundamentalists who believe they should be closed on Saturday or Sunday.  Vegans might demonstrate in front while ranchers lobby managers in back.  Supervisors would set prices according to interest group power.  We then might see bread quotas, veal purchasing regulations, subsidies for union-labeled wine, and shortages common.  Political power would trump consumer preferences, just like it does with public forest management today.</P><P>    	Since wealth and political power go together, the poor are usually advantaged when we move decisions from the political arena to the marketplace.  They are usually disadvantaged when we decide politically.  </P><P>    	Montana State University Professor Ramona Marotz-Baden summarizes, &quot;Fortunately, we have pretty much kept these decisions out of the political arena.  People make decisions and exercise their consciences instead of imposing their preferences by using the force of the state.  Peace, progress, and efficiency are the result we have learned to expect.&quot; </P><P>    	No single set of institutions is perfect.  There's an appropriate role for government, for public non-profit organizations (huge ones like The Boy Scouts and Nature Conservancy, or small ones like FREE and the Gallatin Institute), and for the marketplace.  In general, there are strong ethical and material reasons to shift decisions away from government.  Harmonious diversity is one of the best. </P><P>_______________ <BR>John A.

<H1>Helping to Build a Sustainable Next West</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>The Gallatin Institute links writers of the West with environmental economists.  Last weekend poets, novelists, historians and essayists spent three days exploring ideas and ideals with policy analysts at the Gallatin Gateway Inn, a beautifully restored railroad hotel between Bozeman and West Yellowstone, Montana.    </P>

<P>Such communication is something new because the participants come from disparate tribes.  Their brains seem programed to see and process different kinds of information.  Artists and analysts seldom mingle easily.  A shared commitment to help build a sustainable next West, based upon local communities and respect for the lessons of our history and bio-geography, brought them together.  </P>

<P>Why intermingle artists and economists?  Mixing cultures is difficult and dangerous.  It's a risky venture but one worth undertaking.  Writers sensitize us to values and to new ways of seeing them.  Analysts help us understand how we might better cooperate to realize those values.</P>

<P>I've known sensitive people who define economists as those who &quot;know the price of everything but the value of nothing&quot;.  At best, they are only half right; as Thomas Sowell observed, the variables which economists can measure are not those that matter most.  </P>

<P>This is inherent to the nature of the world.  No matter how smart, how well funded, or how powerful their computer, analysts will never put a good metric on friendship, beauty, trust or peace.  Good economists know the limitations of their discipline.  </P>

<P>Yet microeconomics, the study of choice in public and private arenas, has important explanatory power.  This discipline has great potential for improving environmental policy.  Any proposal for reform that violates economic principles or the laws of nature is doomed.</P>

<P>When we apply these economic principles to problems, we can make predictions.  Specifically, if some behavior's cost, in terms of reputation, comfort or money, increases, and the benefits of that behavior remain constant, then we'll see less of that behavior.  For example, if litterers were subjected to the lash and branded on their foreheads with a L, then we'd see less littering.   Conversely, if landowners were rewarded for attracting and harboring endangered species, rather than penalized as they are now, more species would be safe.  The principles are quite simple but have profound implications.</P>

<P>It is likely that the evolutionary process has hard-wired these responses into our nature; they are strong survival characteristics.  People who act in accordance with these principles are more likely to do well and enjoy a good life than those who do not.  I have long argued that economics so understood is merely a division of the more general field of evolutionary biology.  </P>

<P>Understanding of economic principles helps us separate hopes for the future from expectations about that future.  As smart people experience life, they are ever better at making these distinctions.  </P>

<P>This ability to distinguish hopes from expectations is an important measure of practical intelligence.  Those who lack it are most charitably described as naive.  But some old-line paleo-enviros still reject economic analysis.  As one said, &quot;the word economics makes me hiss like The Hobbit's Gollum: I hates it, I hates it, I hates it forever.&quot;</P>

<P>Is it ethically or intellectually responsible to remain willfully ignorant?  Thanks to the work of researchers such as Lynn Scarlett, Randal O'Toole and Tom Power, sincere environmentalists increasingly see the value of political economy and policy analysis. </P>

<P>This helps explain why environmentalists have become skeptical about utopian schemes.  As smart people experience life's successes and failures, they develop an intuitive sense of these economic principles.  They recognize that there are no perfect solutions, only many competing tradeoffs.   </P>

<P>Learning by trial and error is grossly inefficient.  Explanation of principles by sensitive and empathetic teachers works much better.  However, economists are selected for analytical skills and abstract logic, not empathy and sensitivity.  Economists are among the few who find Calculus a compelling form of communication.  Few economists communicate easily with artists.</P>

<P>Economists' powerful analytic leverage can help us deal with problems, but only if they connect and communicate with those who care deeply about environmental quality.  Most people need to know how much you care before they care how much you know.  If economists are perceived as calculating not compassionate, their contributions will be resisted.  </P>

<P>Rejection of analysis and economic reasoning retards environmental reform.  The success of dialogues, such as the one hosted by the Gallatin Institute, gives us prudent optimism as we contemplate the next West. </P>

<P>Americans are increasingly concerned about our wildlands.  Historically we looked toward federal custodians.  But, if you believe that Congress will respond with large appropriations, read no further.</P>

<P>The federal government has made promises it cannot afford to keep.  The implications preclude an expanded federal wildlands system.  What will happen when actual spending cuts become unavoidable?  As the 104th Congress demonstrates, environmental expenditures are prime targets.</P>

<P>Yet, as our ecological understanding increases, we realize that large, intact systems are important.  David Quammen, author of <CITE>Song of the Dodo</CITE>, notes that wildlands cannot exist merely as &quot;island ecologies&quot;.  Without linking large, diverse areas and populations, island ecologies are doomed to stagnate and fail.  But will wildlands be worth their political cost to politicians?</P>

<P>Already, half the federal budget goes to Medicare and Social Security.  This drain is projected to double in the next 40 years.  What will be left for wildlands?  And where would federal wildlands be if revenue-hungry Congressmen, pressured by retired baby boomers, propose selling off bits and pieces of federal lands to fund the boomers' retirement?  </P>

<P>According to a Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation report, <CITE>The View from Airlie</CITE>, such mischief is endemic to top-down control where local sites &quot;offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Allowing the political process to determine the priority of wildlands designations invites michief.  With the Presidio, an old naval base, becoming a national park, might the <A HREF="http://www.pmrma-www.army.mil/rma.html">Rocky Mountain Arsenal</A> be designated a Wilderness Area? (This would eliminate the required cleanup.)</P>

<P>We expect politicians' attention spans to reach only to the next election, but wildlands require long-term stewardship.  These two time frames are incompatible.  Politicians aren't held accountable for events after they leave office.</P>

<P>Yet, the stubborn reliance on command-and-control by orthodox environmentalists ignores these structural impediments to a federal wildlands program.  We need new institutional arrangements to protect massive tracts of wildlands.  Responsible and constructive proposals are required.  Here are a few ideas.</P>

<P>Across America, untold multitudes of environmentally sensitive landowners are eager to manage their land for environmental ends but are afraid of political entanglements and potential takings.  The Safe Harbor program in North Carolina is successful because it responds to landowner concerns.  It is expected to double the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker population through voluntary agreements with landowners. Previously, the arrival of these woodpeckers meant losing control of their property.  Landowners enrolled in Safe Harbor have their rights protected.  If they attract woodpeckers they may continue active forestry and agriculture.  Similar programs can link large tracts of wilderness without removing land from all productive uses.</P>

<P>Creativity, flexibility, and adaptability are essential in coordinating habitat and wildlands.  These are not attributes of governmental bureaucracies.  Environmental entrepreneurs, however, like leaders of the <A HREF="http://www2.rmef.org/rmef/">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A>, specialize in identifying conservation opportunities and building a constituency for wildlands.  Likewise, other conservationists could invest in wildlands based on voluntary agreements and mutual exchange.</P>

<P>When governments restrict use of private wildlands, landowners have strong incentives to develop their property before a bureaucrat comes locking.  In the voluntary sector, on the other hand, landowners are rewarded if their parcels qualify as wildlands and become attractive to a regional &quot;Wildlands Easement Trust&quot;.  </P>

<P>A regional Wildlands Easement Trust would have a board of trustees, similar in operation to those of museums and hospitals.  This decentralized approach allows caretaking priorities to adapt to increases in scientific understanding.</P>

<P>Such an approach wouldn't rely on massive federal land acquisition or regulatory intervention.  This different path to the same goal promises better results with less confrontation.  Dave Foreman founded <A HREF="http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/campaigns/ef/earthfirst.html">Earth First!</A> because of his frustration with the pro-environment but entirely statist Carter Administration.  He observes &quot;conservationists have relied too much on federal government law and regulation&quot;.  He reminds us that it &quot;has also been easier to pass federal laws than to work out good conservation through the free market or through voluntary agreements.&quot;</P>

<P>Preserving vast tracts of land, as Wildlands Easement Trusts promise to do, is a daunting task not amenable to quick fixes.  The dangerous temptation is to rely upon governments alone to constrain those who would gladly plunder our natural heritage.   America's heritage is not about coercing dissenters into obedient silence.  As Alexis de Tocqueville explained early in our history, Americans excel at building voluntary institutions that foster cooperative pursuit of shared interests.  </P>

<P>Saving wildlands by dipping deeper into the U.S. Treasury is doomed to frustration and failure.  Federal management predictably fails to deliver environmental goods--be they commodities like timber or amenities like habitat.  There is an important federal role to monitor against abuse and adjudicate conflict.  Mischief follows when it tries to manage.</P>

<P>A decentralized and flexible approach, and positive incentives can make Wildlands Easement Trusts happen.  Private and public, nongovernmental wildlands provide our best and most realistic opportunities to further protect nature's precious gifts.</P>

<P>We have many successful models all across America:  the R Ranch in California, the Iram Wild Horse Preserve in South Dakota, Pennsylvania's <A HREF="http://jasper.stanford.edu/OBFS/stations/PA_Hawk_Mountain_Sanct..html">Hawk Mountain</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.biddeford.com/~mcht/trusts/mcht.htm">Maine Coast Heritage Trust</A>.  These nature preserves offer important lessons in the new environmentalism. </P>

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>3/29/95</P><H1><P>Earth Day reconsidered: liberty, ecology, prosperity</P></H1> <P>          On April 22 we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day. This is also the last time I will teach the environmental policy course I began teaching in 1970 at Indiana University.</P><P>       When I began teaching environmental courses, many of my colleagues looked toward two reforms for ecological salvation: an environmental ethic to regulate behavior and a wise and powerful government to manage for the greatest good, for the greatest number, for the long run. While ethics are indeed important and limited government has value, we have learned since Earth Day not to depend on either.</P><P>     Students in environmental courses still bring some burdensome baggage: well-intended but fundamentally naive ideas regarding the potential of altruism and government action. Unless trained in economics, they come mentally wired with an anti-market, anti-property-rights orientation. They often can't separate their hopes from reasonable expectations for political solutions. They believe that government power is easily harnessed for good ends.</P><P>     Fortunately, as students grow wiser they often reject government command-and-control. They follow the examples of leading academics and environmental writers. These people have learned the perverse, unintended consequences of bureaucratic governance, e.g., ecological damage caused by predator- and fire-control programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P><P>     Skepticism of the notion that government has a nearly boundless power to do ecological good is spreading. For example, John Crutcher, the editor and publisher of Common Ground, a New Age, environmentally sensitive monthly magazine, wrote a March cover story on property rights. In discussing the federal resource agencies, Crutcher notes:</P><P>       &quot;Rather than the public trust being protected, society's preserves have been sacrificed upon the altar of the almighty federal pie - and without even making a profit upon selling out its employer - the taxpayer.&quot;</P><P>       He explains that agencies maximize budgets rather than profits. They compete for market share, scrambling for hunks of the federal budget. Such articles are becoming common in the elite media and even in green magazines, including Northern Lights, High Country News and Sierra. In the popular media as in academia, we're moving up the environmental policy learning curve.</P><P>     One hundred years ago, Progressive era reformers told America that professional management motivated by the public interest and guided by science would work well. Today, economics and history have exposed this dictum as a self-serving myth. Rather than being boundless, the federal government's constructive role is limited to:</P><P>       (1) Providing legal means that enable people to protect themselves from pollution;</P><P>     (2) Supporting basic research;</P><P>     (3) Protecting migratory resources such as waterfowl;</P><P>     (4) Protecting our heritage.</P><P>     When going beyond these assignments, bureaucratic pathologies ultimately prevail.</P><P>     For 25 years, I've explored ways to harmonize liberty, ecology and prosperity. In my judgment, the most important principles are quite clear:</P><P>       First, unless consciously randomized, decisions are made on the basis of information and incentives. This is true whether we are trying to save our souls, soils or seals.</P><P>     But institutions differ dramatically in the quality of information and strength of incentive they generate. And each kind of institution biases the results in some way. Elective politics, for example, rewards the ambitious, rich and duplicitous while placing sincere, honest reformers at a huge disadvantage.</P><P>     The second principle is equally important but carries less analytic power: Character and personal integrity matter a great deal. There are good people who, at least in the short run, can withstand the force of institutions that generate poor information and perverse incentives. For example, I respect and admire individuals who do good work in the bowels of the Forest Service.</P><P>     The above principles tell us that stated mission gives little clue as to actual performance. Here are two examples.</P><P>     The Park Service is to employ science and sound management to protect the integrity of our most valuable natural treasure. Universities are to foster the search for truth. Yet, the Park Service tried to suppress the University Press of Colorado's publication of the book &quot;Rocky Times in Rocky Mountain National Park&quot; by Karl Hess, an ecological scientist who had done years of field work in Rocky Mountain Park. To his credit, Luther Wilson, head of the University Press, stood firm, resisted Park Service pressures, and published the book.</P><P>     In contrast, when Alston Chase published his book, &quot;Playing God In Yellowstone: The Destruction of America's First National Park,&quot; Bill Tietz, then president of a university beholden to Park Service favor, fought to keep that book out of Yellowstones' visitors' centers. This is despite the fact that Chase's book has been adopted and recommended by such universities as Harvard, Stanford, Washington and Yale.</P><P>     There is no substitute for character. But character alone cannot consistently produce good policy. Over time, the incentives generated by institutions usually trump ethics by attracting certain types of people. The Forest Service is a friendly environment for those who think science should be subservient to budgetary imperatives. Forest Service employees whose ethics lead them to think otherwise find that promotions are elusive. The Forest Service is not unique; good character will not prevail without good institutions.</P><P>     Thus, successful environmental reform must focus upon institutional design. An important task of stewardship is to create institutions that harmonize private and public interests. Private property rights, markets and voluntary cooperation can foster these ends. After 25 years of trying, I believe I can now tell how this all works.</P><P>__________<BR>John A.

Baden</P><P>At each summer's end, I leave our Montana ranch and return to Washington.  I love to drive the West.  </P><P>This is a good time to reconsider our culture, ecology, economy and politics.  Increasingly, I'm having second thoughts about these subjects.  Many friends, academics, business people and environmentalists, are also re-evaluating their approach to environmental goals.  </P><P>Our culture, economy, and politics were based upon the exploitation of natural resources.  This gave the West coherence.   The default position was to dam rivers, graze grass, cut timber, butcher buffalo.  Even our great National Parks were promoted by railroads for their potential tourist revenue.  </P><P>Some people were rapacious and opportunistic; a blessed few were prudent stewards.  But the dominant politics and economics were insensitive to noncommercial or spiritual aspects of our environment.  In the past generation, a majority of people have became environmentalists.  The West changed.  </P><P>It's time for another.  A new environmental paradigm is emerging and perhaps with it, a new coherence for the West.  </P><P>This approach accepts the significance of noncommercial and spiritual values.  It also recognizes the critical importance of information and incentives.  Good intentions and education will not suffice.  Big bureaucracies will stray from their mission.  Political force will lead to plunder.  And takings, even for good ecological cause, are perverse.  It is irresponsible to pretend these problems away.</P><P> Economic logic has powerful analytic tools but they alone are not enough.  Even though I came to economics from anthropology, and should have known better, I slighted community while focused on efficiency.  (Sometimes it takes years to de-program the lessons of graduate school.)  </P><P>Driving down the Blackfoot Drainage toward the Columbia, I realized that no one has ever gone to the wall for efficiency.  And only the naive would even think of mobilizing citizens under its banner.  The variables that economists can best measure are not those which matter most.  But this is not to recommend some New Age eco-romanticism.  We must consider ecological science, political economy and culture if we are to design successful reform.  In isolation, none will do the job.</P><P>Modern societies can be destructive and corrupting but they provide the means for sensitive and constructive action.  Our task is to foster their humane potential and make them ecologically sustainable.  Science and prosperity are our best allies in this effort.  A return to the folkways and mores of the Native Americans, even were it possible, gives no answer.  Here's a second thought for romantics to consider.</P><P>Early man was not the far-sighted ecological steward of myth.  The ideal of sustainable harvests were as foreign as IRAs.  </P><P>Charles Kay is a wildlife research ecologist at Utah State University.  For 20 years he has examined the archeological record of Greater Yellowstone.  He and other researchers have noted that with the arrival of Homo sapiens on on the North American continent, many species of large herbivores went extinct.  </P><P>There is an emerging theory of &quot;aboriginal overkill.&quot;  Humans were effective predators.  Can any other animal run a mile, swim a river, climb a tree and organize a pack to hunt?  Add fire as a tool and a real killer emerges.  Kay writes:</P><I><P>[Aboriginal peoples] . . . acted in ways that maximized their individual fitness regardless of the impact on the environment.  By limiting ungulate numbers and purposefully modifying the vegetation with fire, Native Americans structured entire plant and animal communities of western North America.</P</I>><P>The Plains Indians were smart, tough and remarkably skillful.  When they received the horse, steel knife and finally the gun, it became much easier and safer to kill bison.  These new tools gave the Indians a huge discount on buffalo.   At the lower price, they rationally bought more.     This behavior is an efficient adjustment by individual tribes to changing &quot;prices&quot; of bison.  The buffalo were fugitive resources, they really did roam. This movement, coupled with tribal competition for them, made it impossible for the Indians to manage the buffalo as a renewable resource. Slaughter by whites greatly compounded the problem.  </P><P>Early white explorers noted that large ungulates were extremely rare when Whites came to the Rocky Mountain region.  Kay writes, &quot;Between 1835 and 1876, twenty different parties spent a total of 765 days traveling through the Yellowstone ecosystem . . .[T]heir first-person journals contain 45 references to a lack of game or a shortage of food.&quot;  Lewis and Clark nearly starved and were reduced to eating dogs when traversing this region.  Today, the area is over run, over grazed and over browsed - by game.  </P><P>Several Native Americans tribes managed beaver streams and salmon fishing sites with clear and transferable property rights.  However, the Plains Indians' could not control access.  They had no property rights to constrain other hunters.   </P><P>Today many environmentalists are reconsidering means to their ecological ends.  Sustainability does not arrive through ideology.  They can't count on government management for bureaucracies generate pathologies.  And unless constrained, firms will neglect or abuse environmental values.  </P><P>There is no single answer to our goals.  It is time for second thoughts.  I will share some in this series of columns. </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

BADEN </P><P>           CLINTON'S appointments of two strong environmentalists to the posts of secretary of the interior and administrator of EPA have alarmed many business leaders. But the choices of Bruce Babbitt and Carol Browner for these key environmental positions accurately reflect the &quot;greening of America.&quot; They reconfirm the practical necessity for business to act in environmentally sensitive ways.</P><P>       Clinton and Gore's environmental moves signify a definitive break with the tradition of resource development. While there may be a more kind and gentle future for America's bears and bunnies, the businesses upon which our prosperity depends can expect more stringent environmental standards.</P><P>       An important new mission for business is to demonstrate how this greening of America can coexist with increasing efficiency and productivity.</P><P>     This challenge is especially critical to the Northwest. Here in America's  &quot;ecotopia&quot; the conflicts between economy and ecology are pronounced. The economies of the Northwest developed when culture and institutions were oriented toward resource exploitation. Our history is largely a story of damming, logging, mining and ranching. Yet more than any other region, the Northwest is home of the environmentally conscious.</P><P>     With our mix of resource-based industries, changing the environmental behavior of business is neither costless nor smooth. Environmentalists have a vital stake in a successful transition, for if our businesses are not able to adapt to the new standards, we will lose the standard of living upon which our willingness and ability to pay for environmental quality depends.</P><P>     Economist Don Coursey has pointed out that in the United States and other  developed nations, when the income of a state or community rises by 10 percent, its willingness to pay for environmental quality rises by 25 percent. And if a state's income falls 10 percent, this willingness to pay drops by 25 percent. On the basis of this comparative data, we can expect relatively prosperous regions to place greater emphasis on the health of the environment.</P><P>     How can we preserve the environment while continuing the economic progress that fosters environmental quality? One important key lies in preparing tomorrow's business leaders to be environmental managers. Harry E. Teasley, president and CEO of Coca-Cola/Nestle International has noted &quot;After 20 years of interviewing MBAs, I have concluded that most are well trained in the functional areas of finance, accounting and  marketing. These same students, however, have only a superficial or topical understanding of the relationship of business with the environment, the market economy, and public policy.&quot;</P><P>       The University of Washington addresses this problem with a new program to train future decision-makers attending the School of Business. The Environmental Management (EM) Program for MBA students, was established by people who anticipated that the environment would be a high priority on the national agenda and who understand the link between prosperity, environmental concern, and the ability to effectively address this concern.</P><P>     Major universities scattered throughout the United States are developing environmental MBA programs. What makes the University of Washington's effort unique is its emphasis upon market incentives and entrepreneurial innovations.</P><P>        As Dean Leventhal of the Business School notes, &quot;The environmental courses in most business schools are often taught by people who identify with the corporate guilt/social responsibility/command-and-control schools of thought. While we fully consider regulatory approaches to environmental management, our EM Program stresses property rights and market incentives as keys to harmonizing business and the environment.&quot;</P><P>       According to Professor Jonathan Karpoff, Director of the EM Program, the curriculum is built on three intellectual perspectives:</P><P>       --  The &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; made famous by ecologist Garrett Hardin, applies to many of today's environmental problems, such as atmospheric pollution;</P><P>     --  The prosperity that comes from successful, productive businesses fosters the achievement of environmental goals;</P><P>     --  Successful environmental policy must include not only regulation, but also market-oriented incentive-based approaches, such as the use of tradeable permits to curb pollution.</P><P>     Sue Mecklenburg, associate director of the EM Program, explains that it &quot;is designed to teach students how to use the current knowledge of environmental concerns to make better business decisions for both their company and the world. And this July, a week-long seminar at the University of Washington will give today's business executives an overview of environmental management principles.</P><P>     Vice president-elect Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, previews the new political climate under which businesses must operate. Fortunately, some politicians are beginning to understand environmental economics; specifically that environmental concern and the ability to effectively address that concern are dependent upon prosperity.</P><P> ____________</P><P> John A.

<P>If you aren't a good boy, you'll find a lump of coal in your stocking Christmas morning.   This is an unhappy prospect for most American children.  However, we can imagine situations in which a large lump of coal would be a blessing, for example in a city under siege.  Coal would be a wonderful gift for people in Sarajevo lacking fuel for cooking and heating.  The value of a gift depends upon the circumstances of the recipient.  </P>

<P> In the spirit of giving coal to those whose lives it would improve, I propose reform of liabilities and standards on urban Superfund sites called brownfields.  Yes, we can help poor people by relaxing some environmental regulations,  those with perverse consequences.  Superfund is a liability time bomb that strikes fear into the hearts of entrepreneurial developers.  It triggers a slew of environmental and social woes.</P>

<P>	 Like the best solutions to many environmental problems, this gift seems counter-intuitive.  Relaxing the environmental protection standards on brownfields would help clean up our inner cities and improve opportunities.  Brownfields are lands abandoned because of alleged contamination.  They do more than just blemish urban landscapes.  They create multiple problems for inner cities, suburbs, and rural areas.</P>

<P>	 Many brownfields persist due to Superfund's poorly considered regulations and exorbitant litigation costs.  Further, they suffer from laws which make illegal today actions which were legal, proper and productive when undertaken.  These retroactive joint and several liability arrangements are windfalls for lawyers and bureaucrats but they too often harm our most disadvantaged citizens.  </P>

<P> People once believed that such strict regulation and liability were advantageous.  They didn't understand how market incentives encourage cleanup of hazardous sites.   Thanks to scholars such as Don Coursey at the University of Chicago, we now have better understanding of how bureaucracies and markets operate to deal with these problems.  </P>

<P> The derelict lands have been condemned by the EPA due to a mix of real and imagined health risks and bureaucratic errors of classification.  As a result, these lands are taboo for would-be developers.  Urban areas are stuck with empty brownfields. These lands could be used for parks, factories, and housing.  Seattle's Gasworks Park is a stellar example of a blighted site becoming an amenity.  </P>

<P> Superfund shunts industrial development from the urban brownfields to  the &quot;greenfields&quot; of the suburbs and rural periphery.  Farmland and forests are invaded by industry which could move into brownfield sites.  Were it not for the extreme and oft silly operation of Superfund, many of these new developments would be in urban areas.</P>

<P> The invasion of greenfields causes a host of other problems.  Duplicating the necessary infrastructure is expensive.  Economic growth in the suburbs increases urban sprawl and exacerbates traffic problems.  Unemployment in inner cities remains high.  </P>

<P> Worst of all, the brownfield sites remain contaminated.  No one has incentives to clean up the mess.  And nobody converts it into valuable real estate.  It's a lose-lose situation.</P>

<P>	 But there is hope for reform.  Michigan began an effort to turn brownfields and other Superfund sites into attractive real estate for developers.  With covenants-not-to-sue and other legal protections, firms may develop sites without fearing liability for earlier pollution by others. </P>

<P> States have incentives to reform Superfund.  Practical politicians and regulators, and even the EPA itself, realize that we don't need industrial plants with dirt clean enough for kids to eat.  Justice Steve Breyer's Harvard University Press book, Breaking the Vicious Circle,  adds force to this argument.</P>

<P>	 Businesses see potentially profitable ventures in once-idle brownfields.  Local residents benefit as the neighborhood rebounds.  With EPA's co-operation, over 450 properties have begun redevelopment under Michigan's initiative.</P>

<P>	 Business leaders and local authorities band together to remove disincentives to develop brownfields.  Few environmental groups object for they are aware of Cleveland's 167 brownfields, Chicago's 2,000, and 450,000 more across America.  They see how they hurt our inner cities.  Rural environmentalists support reform for they see urban sprawl encroaching on the greenfield buffer zones surrounding metropolitan pollution.</P>

<P>	 Thus far, 27 states have introduced legislation empowering developers to take advantage of brownfields.  By granting assurances that developers wouldn't be held liable for existing contamination, developers are converting the brownfields into productive sites.  Entrepreneurship joins environmentalism.</P>

<P>	 The possibilities for cleaning up brownfields are immense.  Relaxing some standards and removing retroactive liability rules will free entrepreneurs to clean and develop contaminated sites in inner cities.  While they improve blighted inner-city landscapes, the peripheral greenfields will also benefit. </P>

<P>	 All of this can be attained with a simple gift: change the regulations and liabilities for brownfields.  It would cost little.  Inner-city and countryside environments could benefit greatly.  And reform would be a gift that keeps on giving.</P>

<H1>Using a Green Thumb to Hitch an Internet Ride</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>
Deep ecologists urge us to "return to nature".  If we reconnect with nature in a primitive, spiritual way, we may spare mother earth.  Reject science, technology, and the market for small-scale, Edenic lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
I like their goals of environmental protection and sustainability, but their means are dangerously misguided.  A "return to nature" will increase our dependence and consumption of natural resources and our ecological footprint.  
</P>
<P>
In the real world, environmental quality must harmonize with economic progress and sustainable growth.  Entrepreneurs catalyze this harmony by innovating new and better technologies, business practices, and institutions and arrangements.  They distance mankind's activities from nature, leaving more room for both.  
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs often convert industrial waste into useful products.  In the last century, logs were "boomed" into rafts and floated to mills.  Some of the best, most dense old-growth sunk to the bottom of waterways.  Superior Logging Co. is planning to "harvest" 30,000 of these logs from the bottom of Lake Superior.  Company founder Scott Mitchen says, "We're not endangering any spotted owls.... This wood is totally PC.  Any environmentalist has got to love it."  
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Patagonia makes plastic trash into fabric for clothing.  Profitable recycling industries across the nation reduce our dependence on virgin natural resources.  A Vancouver, BC firm has invented a process to dispose of organic garbage (which accounts for 80% of an average American's rubbish) by superheating it into a fuel that, when burned with coal, produces low-pollution power.  Their eco-friendly enterprise relieves pressures on landfills, sanitizes coal power plants, and scores profits.
<P>
The Pacific Northwest is a prime example of how distancing ourselves from the environment can protect nature.  Now, more Northwesterners write software than log trees.  And, some privately owned forests are effectively modelled and managed with computers -- increasing productivity and reducing acres cut.
</P>
<P>
"Cyberfarms" exemplify entrepreneurial innovation fostering environmental quality and economic progress.  One pioneer in this field, <A HREF="http://www.ashtech.com">Ashtech Inc.</A>, operates from Belgrade, Mont.  They help precision farmers use satellite-based Global Position Systems (GPS) to receive essential agricultural data as they drive combines, fertilizer trucks, and spray rigs over their fields.  GPS information tracks variations in elevation, soil composition, weather, and productivity -- down to the square foot.  Cyberfarmers can then make minute adjustments in seeding, fertilizing, and irrigating their fields.
</P>
<P>
Precision farming helps improve crop yields, producing more food on less land.  In addition to being more productive, cyberfarmers have a "green" thumb. With GPS technology farmers no longer need to uniformly blanket their fields with pesticides, water, fertilizer, and other potentially environmentally damaging inputs.  Rather, they can target specific amounts to the areas where they'll be most beneficial.  They save money by reducing chemicals, fertilizers insecticides, herbicides, and water.  High-technology farming can help meet the growing demands of a hungry planet by reducing our use of the land itself.
</P>
<P>
"Cybercommuting" enables us to tread more lightly on the earth as workers ply their trade from home.  Improvements in telecommunication technology enable people to transmit projects and ideas instantaneously across long distances and develop "virtual offices".  Why drive into the office?  Shoppers can buy their fall wardrobe by phone from the <A HREF="http://www.landsend.com">Lands' End</A> catalog, have their <A HREF="http://www.wsj.com"><I>Wall Street Journal</I></A> delivered via email, or buy their next book from <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">"Amazon.com"</A> on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Cybercommuting and the telecommunications revolution have enormous potential for reducing pollution, resource consumption, and environmental impact.  Technological progress makes possible new, environmentally friendly ways to work by decreasing costs and increasing productivity.  Concurrently, environmentally sensitive commuting and communicating leads to economic progress.
</P>
<P>
These entrepreneurial success stories imply an environmnetalism nearly opposite that of conventional environmentalists.  Rather than "return to nature", we must "decouple" ourselves from nature.  Divorcing economic growth from natural resources gives nature room to adjust and repair.  The decoupling also promotes the prosperity so strongly linked to environmental sensitivity.  Richer is not only healthier and safer (more nutritious foods and fewer occupational hazards), richer is also ecologically more sound.
</P>
<P>
Economic development increasingly comes from innovating technologies and business practices -- not exploiting more natural resources.  Entrepreneurs catalyze these developments.  By encouraging "green" entrepreneurs, we foster low environmental impact.  When green thumbs grow better crops with satellites or hitch a ride to work on the Internet, creative resources help nature.
</P>
<P>
We can learn from cyberfarms and cybercommuters.  Both harmonize economic progress with environmental protection.  They ignore or reject the "return to nature" dictum.  They generate economic progress through innovations with benign environmental implications.  Environmental policy will improve when environmentalists recognize that environmental protection increases with such economic prosperity.  
</P>
<P>
The first rule of policy analysis is simple: not all good things go together.  Fortunately, some do.  The task for the policy entrepreneur is to find responsible and sensible alternatives to regulations which stifle entrepreneurial success.

<TITLE>Entitlements and the Everglades Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/28/96</P><H1>More subsidies in the age of corruption entitlements</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>&quot;<EM>Don't Gore us with new taxes</EM>&quot;, picketters in Miami shouted last week.  They opposed Vice President Gore's plan to &quot;tax&quot; the sugar industry in Florida.  A sugar &quot;tax&quot; would be used by the federal government to purchase Everglades land for ecosystem restoration.  In addition to the penny-per-pound &quot;tax&quot;, Gore announced a $1.5 billion environmental cleanup initiative for the Everglades.</P>

<P>	The Everglades ecosystem is clearly degrading.  Environmentalists accuse the sugar industry of despoiling the Everglades.  Economists such as Jonathan Tolman of the libertarian <A HREF="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> counter that government subsidies have encouraged the destruction.</P>

<P>   	Predictably, environmentalists demand a higher tax, and sugar growers want lower taxes.  The debate misses the mark entirely, because the &quot;penny-per-pound tax&quot; is no &quot;tax&quot;.  It is a subsidy reduction.  Gore's plan reduces federal price supports by a penny per pound.  Over $250 million in sugar industry subsidies and an import quota on sugar cost consumers over $1.4 billion a year and harm the Everglades.  </P>

<P>	Subsidies foster destructive agriculture in the Everglades.  Such subsidized destruction of environmental quality is the norm, not an isolated exception.  But politicians of both parties remain blind to opportunities to link fiscal responsibility with ecological integrity.  They and their constituencies have a parasitic relation to taxpayers.  Recipients of wealth transferred from others think they have a right to handouts.  This exemplifies a disturbing trend in American political culture: the conversion of subsidies into entitlements.</P>

<P>	Robert Samuelson of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> describes this in his new book, <CITE>The Good Life and Its Discontents:  The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement</CITE>.  He describes the conflicting and paradoxical nature of entitlements--the notion that we are all entitled to progress and prosperity which government can provide.  The mirage of entitlements, he rightly concludes, shakes the very foundation of American culture.  The problem with entitlements, aside from their conflict with the American ideal of individual responsibility, is the logical consequences of assuming that government can and should provide.</P>

<P>	Should government guarantee us income security and high-quality health care?  If it does, and then what?  What are the predictable consequences of such entitlements?  Entitlements require that government take citizens' scarce resources and distribute them to various interests.  Once government allocates any valuable resource, corruption of purpose must follow.  Here's why: 	</P>

<P>We can never precisely specify what the bureaucrat must do. Some discretion must remain.  And that discretion will normally reflect a political calculus.  The decision maker has incentives to make those determinations that advantage himself, those he favors, and his cause.  <A HREF="gopher://gopher.npr.org:70/11/NPR_Online">National Public Radio</A> programming provides an excellent example.</P>

<P>	When spending the money of others, discretionary power corrupts.  We then see resources going to corporate welfare projects like Senator Bob Dole's ethanol subsidies for Archer Daniels Midland and to the Clintons' friends who wanted to handle travel arrangements for the White House press corps.  With a constituency in place, &quot;subsidies&quot; harden into &quot;entitlements&quot;.</P>

<P>	In the booming postwar years, Samuelson reports, Americans began &quot;to take propserity for granted.&quot;  Times have changed, but our expectations haven't.  We still demand our Social Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing.  These goals necessarily imply trade-offs among competing demands.  The 'right' to farm subsidized sugar comes at the expense of taxpayers and intact ecosystems.  Potential entitlements are endless, but resources are finite.  It's morally and intellectually irresponsible to ignore this reality.</P>

<P>	A century ago, the Progressives did just that.  They claimed that government can and should not only monitor, but also manage resources and provide material benefits.  They and their modern liberal followers believe that social problems can be fixed if only the &quot;right&quot; people were making the decisions.  They thought more discretion by the right bureaucrats will ensure good policy that advances the public interest.  This counsel of perfection was grossly naive.</P>

<P>	America's Founders knew better.  They believed mankind is not perfectible, but rather self-interested.  Therefore they designed institutions to prevent people from harnessing government as an engine of plunder.  They chose a constitutional, limited government with strong checks and balances.  The rights they &quot;entitled&quot; Americans to are found in the Bill of Rights -- mainly freedom from abuse of government power.</P>

<P>	Federal budget deficits, national debt, and actuarial deficits symbolize our Age of Entitlement.  This simply cannot continue indefinitely.  Samuelson suggests we return to the Founders' vision of a limited government that only makes promises it can keep.  Otherwise we'll crash on a runaway system that favors the election of opportunistic, short-sighted politicians with extraordinary abilities to lie in a convincing manner.  All competitive systems favor certain talents.  Political systems that run on claims to welfare favor the best liars.  </P>

<P>	When we consider reform in this Age of Entitlement, remember a constant of political economy: in all systems at all times, wealth and political power go together.  Expanding government entitlements ultimately hurts the poor and debases the moral quality of politicians.  In an Age of Entitlement, civic virtue is an endangered attribute. </P>

BADEN</P><P>           EACH June, at the end of the academic year, I head back to FREE's office in Bozeman, Mont., and spend the summer on a nearby ranch. I cannot imagine a better &quot;commute&quot; than between Seattle and the northern reaches of the Yellowstone ecosystem. On these drives I always recall John Steinbeck's suggestion that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. And I wonder how we can preserve these values.</P><P>       A hint comes from the recent Forbes magazine featuring Bill Gates. I respect Gates, not for his billions, but for his innovation and entrepreneurship. He has created value through a mix of intelligence, inspiration and force of will.</P><P>     Our environment needs such an entrepreneur, a person who can discover a new paradigm for recognizing those values, like biodiversity, which are outside today's market. But all too often there is no good link between our environmental values and large, bureaucratic institutions. Multimillion-dollar environmental groups lobby Congress for more laws while corporations lobby to resist.</P><P>     The losers in this environmental policy arena often end up in court in an effort to win what was lost in Congress. Environmental laws and backup bureaucracies slog along with unsatisfactory results. The options are discouraging.</P><P>     We need more innovation from small and quick organizations with site-specific information, and local as well as global concern. We need creative institutions whose leaders find ways to reach environmental values economically and economic values environmentally. Responsible liberty is a requisite to such success.</P><P>     Government can only do so much. It can change the rules of the game to the benefit of this group or that, but as the timber industry has learned, tides can quickly change. Since we can only rent - never buy - politicians, no battle is won, only prolonged. And government seldom creates. It seldom finds ways to make the pie larger, only different ways to cut it - often with a huge kerf in the form of overhead and inefficiency.</P><P>     From society's perspective, successful entrepreneurs are the</P><P> chefs who create new and better dishes from ingredients and combinations not previously seen or realized. They provide the closest thing we have to a free lunch, and they respond quickly to changing tastes and preferences.</P><P>     A small number of environmental entrepreneurs have long been with us. The Boone and Crockett Club, led by Teddy Roosevelt, was founded in 1887 by America's first conservationists.</P><P>     On my way to Montana I will pass near the club's recently established Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. The ranch's mission is to find ways in which wildlife and ranching can peacefully and productively coexist. It is to be a profitable ranch and a wildlife research center.</P><P>     If it is successful, and so far it seems to be, the ranch will be a model for others. By encouraging species to which many ranchers are hostile, and by succeeding, it can aid ecological balance throughout the West. Wolf reintroduction, for example, is unlikely to succeed if ranchers cannot manage their impact. My wife and I know from experience on our ranch how difficult predators can be. The Roosevelt Ranch may show ranchers how predators may be accommodated with minimal loss of livestock. If so, their presence surely would enhance the West.</P><P>     Closer to Seattle, The Village Conservancy is seeking new ways to insert environmentally sensitive housing into natural environments without diminishing those environments.</P><P>     A nonprofit group, the Conservancy seeks to bring landowners together to create low-impact communities in which individuals will have only minimal land for their homes while jointly owning surrounding acreage, which would be managed for aesthetic and conservation values. Such a trial project by The Village Conservancy for the North Fork Valley of Issaquah Creek was authorized recently by the King County Council.</P><P>     Governmental authorization of innovative land use is unusual and commendable. Such action implies intelligence and political courage.</P><P>     Environmental entrepreneurs produce social value by identifying new opportunities and motivating action. In this way, voluntary grass-roots cooperation fosters our environmental goals. The small associations envisioned by The Village Conservancy must, if they are to function effectively, be created by mutual consent and mutual interest. They are unlikely to be the solution for everyone.</P><P>     But with new options, like those envisioned by The Village Conservancy, the more likely we are to harmonize liberty, prosperity, and ecology.</P><P>     Whether it be integrating an old way of life with more recent environmental concerns, as on the Roosevelt Ranch, or creating new communities and associations centered around environment conservation with The Village Conservancy, environmental entrepreneurship shows its value.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A.

1.  COMMITTEES AND TASK FORCES.  The Board of Directors may
delegate to an Executive Committee, comprised of the Officers of
the Association, such specific duties and responsibilities as the
Board of Directors may from time to time determine, provided that
the Executive Committee shall report matters as appropriate to
the full Board, and the full Board shall at all times retain
general and overall responsibility for conducting the affairs of
the Association.  The President, with the approval of the Board
of Directors, may appoint other committees and task forces, to
which particular duties and responsibilities may be delegated.
No person may serve on a Committee unless he/she is a Member in
good standing.  No person may continue as a Committee Member if
he/she misses two consecutive Meetings of such Committee unless,

shall have five permanent committees -- the Government Relations
Committee, the Technology Committee, the Membership Committee,
the Standards Committee, and the Industry Promotion and
Communications Committee.

          (a)  The Government Relations Committee will monitor
          developments in state and federal courts, local, state
          and federal litigation and administrative rule makings
          or other proceedings that affect the operations of the
          Industry, and advise the Association with respect to
          the opportunities to educate public policymakers.  The
          Government Relations Committee will have the
          responsibility for developing liaisons with other trade
          associations and industry groups on issues of interest
          to the Association's members.

          (b)  The Technology Committee shall monitor technology
          developments in the real estate information industry,
          including related developments in the communications
          and computer industry, and advise the Association with
          respect to the technical issues confronting the
          Industry.

          (c)  The Membership Committee shall assist the
          President with creating and maintaining a strong
          membership base of the Association and conduct
          educational outreach efforts to develop awareness about
          the Association among real estate information firms,
          professionals, associations, vendors, customers, and
          related technology companies.

          (d)  The Standards Committee shall monitor
          developments in the industry and consider various data
          standards that could further the fair and efficient
          dissemination of real estate information.

          (e)  The Industry Promotion and Communications
          Committee shall assist the Association in developing
          and implementing Association strategy to promote the
          responsible use and dissemination of real estate
          information products and services.  The Committee will
          have the responsibility to communicate the
          Association's activities among its Members and to the
          public at large.

Ad hoc committees may be formed from time to time by the Board of
Directors to carry out special projects and assignments.

2.  RULES.  The Board of Directors may establish rules that are
consistent with these Bylaws for the policies, procedures and
programs of the Association.

Article IX - Indemnification

1.  Directors & Officers

          (a)  The Association shall, to the fullest extent now
          or hereafter permitted by law, indemnify any person who
          was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party
          to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
          proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
          investigative (other than an action by or in the right
          of the Association) by reason of the fact that such
          person is or was a Director or Officer of the
          Association, a Chair, Vice-Chair or member of any
          Committee or Task Force of the Association, or an
          employee or other agent of the Association or of any
          other organization served by him in any capacity at the
          request of the Association against expenses (including
          attorneys' fees) judgments, fines, amounts paid in
          settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such
          person in connection with such action, suit or
          proceeding, if he/she acted in good faith and in a
          manner he/she reasonably believed to be in, or not
          opposed to, the best interest of the Association, and,
          with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
          he/she had no reasonable cause to believe that his/her
          conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action,
          suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
          conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
          equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption
          that the person did not act in good faith and in a
          manner which he/she reasonably believed to be in, or
          not opposed to, the best interests of the Association,
          and, with respect to the criminal action or proceeding,
          had no reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct
          was unlawful.

          (b)  The Association shall indemnify any person who was
          or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to
          any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
          proceeding by or in the right of the Association to
          procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact
          that he/she is or was a Director or Officer of the
          Association, or a Chair, Vice-Chair, or member of any
          Committee or Task Force of the Association, or an
          employee or other agent of the Association or of any
          other organization served by him in any capacity at the
          request of the Association against expenses (including
          attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
          him/her in connection with the defense or settlement of
          such action or suit, if he/she acted in good faith and
          in a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in, or not
          opposed to, the best interest of the Association.  No
          indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim,
          issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
          adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in
          the performance of his/her duty to the Association,
          unless, and only to the extent that, a court in which
          action or suit was brought shall determine upon
          application that, despite the adjudication of
          liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the
          case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
          indemnity for such expenses.

          (c)  To the extent that any person referred to in
          subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph 1 has been
          successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
          action, suit or proceeding referred to therein or in
          defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he/she
          shall be indemnified against expenses (including
          attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by
          him/her in connection therewith.

          (d)  Any indemnification under subparagraphs (a) and
          (b) of this paragraph 1 (unless ordered by a court)
          shall be made by the Association only as authorized in
          the specific case upon a determination that
          indemnification of the person is proper in the
          circumstances because he/she has met the applicable
          standard of conduct set forth in subparagraphs (a) and
          (b) of this paragraph 1.  Such determination shall be
          made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote
          of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not
          parties to such action, suit or proceedings, or (ii) if
          such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
          obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so
          directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
          opinion, or (iii) if neither of the preceding actions
          occurs, by a majority vote of the Representatives of
          Regular Members.

          (e)  Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal
          action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the
          Association in advance of the final disposition of such
          action, suit or proceeding if the Board so authorizes
          in light of all the circumstances, and upon receipt of
          an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director or
          Officer by or on behalf of whom such expenses are
          incurred to repay such amount unless it shall
          ultimately be determined that he/she is entitled to be
          indemnified by the Association as provided in this
          paragraph 1.

          (f)  The indemnification provided by this paragraph 1
          shall not be deemed to preclude any other rights to
          which a person seeking indemnification may be entitled
          under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of members of
          disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action
          in his/her official capacity and as to action in
          another capacity while holding such office, and shall
          continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director
          or Officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
          heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

          (g)  The Association shall have power to purchase and
          maintain insurance covering the Association and any
          person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee,
          agent or Chair, Vice-Chair, or member of a Committee,
          Task Force or similar group of the Association, against
          liability asserted against such persons and incurred in
          any such capacity, or arising out of his/her status as
          such, whether or not the Association would have the
          power to indemnify him/her against such liability under
          the provisions of this paragraph 1.

2.  EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.  The Board of Directors may, by
resolution, extend prospectively or retrospectively the
indemnification provisions of the foregoing paragraph 1 to any
person, business, entity, or organization who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that
he/she is or was an employee, agent, or other officially
designated representative of the Association.

Article X - Antitrust Compliance

It is the policy of the Association to comply fully with all
applicable laws, including the antitrust laws, and accordingly,
all activities of the Association shall be conducted in
accordance with its Antitrust Compliance Guidelines, as they from
time to time may be adopted or modified by the Board of
Directors.

Article XI - Member Representations

No member of the Association is authorized to speak or take
action on behalf of the Association without the prior specific
authorization of the Board of Directors.  In addition, no member
is authorized to use the name or logo of the Association for
conducting its non-Association business in any manner that
suggests or reasonably may be interpreted to imply the approval
by the Association, rather than or in addition to mere members in
the Association.

Article XII - Books and Records

The Association shall keep correct and complete books and records
of account and shall also keep minutes of the proceedings of its
members, Board of Directors, and committees having any of the
authority of the Board of Directors, and shall keep at the
registered or principal office a record giving the names and
addresses of the members entitled to vote.  All books and records
of the Association, except for records reflecting internal
personnel matters, executive session matters, litigation and
claim-related matters, or other matters properly kept
confidential, may be inspected by any member, or his agent or
attorney, for any proper purpose, at any reasonable time.

Article XIII - Arbitration

Grievances of a Regular Member, Associate Member, or Honorary
Member against the Association first shall be presented to the
Board of Directors and Executive Director.  If the grievance is
unresolved by the Board of Directors and Executive Director, then
Regular Members, Associate Members and Honorary Members agree to
waive trial by jury in favor of arbitration of any grievance
against the Association or against a Member of the Association in
the course of Association work or against an employee or agent of
the Association at a site selected by the Board of Directors in
the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, or at such alternative
site as is agreeable to the Board of Directors of the
Association.  Such arbitration shall be conducted under the rules
of the American Arbitration Association.

Article XIV - Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the Association shall be the calendar year.

Article XV - Amendments

The Bylaws may be amended by vote of two-thirds of the entire
Board of Directors of the Association at a Meeting held after at
least two weeks written notice shall have been sent to the Board
of Directors stating the substance of the proposed amendment.

Article XVI - Dissolution

The Association may be dissolved upon the affirmative vote of
three-quarters of the entire Board of Directors.  In the event of
such dissolution, the remaining assets of the Association shall
be applied and distributed pursuant to Virginia law.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>
<p>
<font size=+1>
<b><i>MLS Roundtable merges with REI Providers Association</i></b>
</font>
<p>
Board Elects First Officers
<p><b><i>
Memphis, TN, June 17</i> </b>
-- The MLS Vendor Roundtable, an association of the
major multiple listing services, has voted to merge its operations with the
newly formed REI Providers Association (REIPA).

<p>
The MLS Vendor Roundtable is composed of more than two dozen providers of
residential multiple listing services across the country including industry
giants Interealty Corp., Moore Data Management Services, and Boris
Information Systems.  The Roundtable's members will now pursue their agenda
within the REI Providers Association.  "The decision to merge reflects a
belief on the part of the MLS industry that there should be an integrated
approach to real estate information," said Rick Roof, vice president of
Interealty Corp. and the Chairman of the MLS Roundtable.  "We can accomplish
a great deal more within the context of the larger industry Association."

<p>
At their meeting in Memphis, TN, on June 7, the REIPA Board of Directors
welcomed the members of the MLS Roundtable and agreed to form an MLS Task
Force which will be composed of mls vendors of all sizes  to begin to shape
the agenda for the future. 

<p>
The Board also appointed Tom Gay, Vista Information Solutions, San Diego,
CA, to head a second Task Force composed of Commercial Real Estate
Information Providers for the purpose of determining the ways in which the
Association can serve this segment of the industry.  It is expected that
both of these Task Forces will meet within the next 90 days to begin their work.

<p>
In other areas, the REIPA Board elected W.B. Freeman, Clareity Consulting,
LLC, Des Moines, IA, to serve as the Association's first President.  Rufus
Lusk III, TRW REDI Property Data, Washington, DC will serve as
President-Elect and will succeed to the Presidency of the Association
following Mr. Freeman's term on January 1, 1998.  Tony Stewart, Moore Data
Management Services, Minneapolis, MN, will serve as the Association's Vice
President for Membership.

<p>
The Board also confirmed the selection of two other officers.  Gilbert
Barnes, Data Track Systems, Carlsbad, CA will serve as the  REIPA Treasurer,
and Fred Baca, Baca Landata, Houston, TX, will  serve as Secretary. 

<p>
Finally, the Board announced a cooperative venture with GIS World,
publishers of Business Geographics, to offer a complimentary subscription to
the magazine to all members of the REI Providers Association.

<p>
The Real Estate Information Providers Association is a national Association
established to provide a forum for purveyors of information related to both
commercial and residential property as well as the application, support
services,  and other organizations associated with these efforts.

<p>
For further information regarding the REI Providers Association and its
activities, contact the National Office in Washington, DC at 202-328-7460 or

<P>I. The Public Record Has a Long and Important History in Promoting American
Democracy and Commerce	
</b></u>
<P>Since the colonization of the New World in the 17th century, open public
records have been a basic cornerstone of American commerce and society.  In
going from the Old World of privilege for some to the New World of opportunity
for all, there was a paradigm shift in the way that government data was viewed. 
The public record evolved from being the property of a certain class to the
possession of all.  This  important and fundamental American tradition, rooted
in the writings of great democratic political philosophers such as John Locke, 
was first practiced in Colonial New England, and later  affirmed by the
country's Founders.  They believed that information, appropriately and
responsibly used,  should promote democracy, by increasing the nature and extent
of citizen knowledge and participation in governmental decisions, the economy,
and politics, both at the national and local levels.  This viewpoint flowed from
a profound, revolutionary idea:  government belongs to the public, not to a
sovereign.</P>
<P>Government agencies collect information while recording property ownership
and transfers, assessing taxes, setting zoning, and approving permits.  This
information has always been collected, not only to allow the government to do
its specific work, but also with the goal of public dissemination.  Open
ownership laws and public review examination of the ownership, sale and transfer
of real estate have been an established part of public policy since the earliest
days of our democracy.  Moreover it was always felt that if the records were
kept restricted and secret that there would be many more opportunities for
corruption, secret dealings, and dishonest and unfair property accumulation. 
All one has to do is open the newspaper to see the value of public real estate
data being  open to the public.  Virtually every day a reporter writes a story
about the prosecutor who attacks questionable associations involving public
officials, a political campaign's review of the opponent's dealings, or the
newspaper's own investigation of a public official's financial dealings.</P>
<p>
<a name="ii"></a>
<b><u>II. Better Information Means Fairer Markets</H1>
</b></u>
<P>The fact that reliable information was available, from  reputable objective
sources, meant that commercial markets could develop where all parties had an
equal and  fair advantage in transactions.  The openness of the early public
record, along with its purpose of serving the greater good for the entire
society, is the genesis of the information resources that have fueled the growth
of our consumer based economy today.  The fact that information is readily
available, accurate, comprehensive and timely creates confidence in markets,
whether it be the stock market, the crop futures market or the real estate
market.  Good information translates into vibrant, fair markets; incomplete or
misleading or limited information gives unfair advantage to one particular group
to the disadvantage of others. In short bad information promotes inefficient,
unfair markets.  Our democratic American tradition has always sided with widely
disseminated information, to the benefit of all.</P>
<P>Unrestricted information flow protects markets.  The experience in other
industries is instructive. The world's largest equities markets are located in
the United States.  After the October, 1987 stock market crash, many observers
believed that the average individual stock market investor would be scared off. 
Instead the last ten years have seen an enormous flow of individual investor
dollars back to Wall Street equities.  The number of stock and bond mutual funds
has grown from 1,000 to over 7,000.  Consumers have undoubtedly been well served
by the growth of Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar publications and
various other stock market newsletters and business journals.  Publicly
available data -- objective, timely, and comprehensive -- on mutual funds and
fund mangers performance has protected and greatly benefited consumers.  With
this knowledge and confidence the flow of investment dollars has created a much
larger equities market.(and paid for a lot of retirements and college
tuitions!). Investors have been able to make intelligent decisions based on good
data.</P>

<b><u>
III. Better Real Estate Information is Critical to the Real Estate Financing, Sales and Leasing Markets of Tomorrow</b></u>
<p>
   The availability of reliable information  from  reputable, objective sou
rces, allowed the development of  commercial markets where all parties had an eq
ual and  fair advantage in transactions.  The openness of the early public recor
ds, in accordance with the established goal of serving the greater good of the e
ntire society, was an essential cornerstone in supporting the foundation of the
information resources that have fueled the growth of our consumer-based economy.
<p>
  The fact that information is readily available, accurate, comprehensive and timely creates confidence in markets, whether it be the stock market, the crop futures market, or the real estate market.  Quality information translates into  fair market vibrancy; substandard or limited information gives unfair advantage toone particular group to the disadvantage of others. In substandard  information tends to promote substandard market performance.  Our democratic American tradition has historically supported policies and programs which foster the broad-based dissemination of information, for  the benefit of all who properly apply it.  
The availability of reliable information  from  reputable, objective sources, allowed the development of  commercial markets where all parties had an equal and  fair advantage in transactions.  The openness of the early public records, in accordance with the established goal of serving the greater good of the entire society, was an essential cornerstone in supporting the foundation of the information resources that have fueled the growth of our consumer-based economy.
<p>
        Unrestricted information flow protects markets.  The experience in other industries is instructive. The world's largest equities markets are located in the United States.  After the October, 1987 stock market crash, many observers believed that the average individual stock market investor would be scared off.  Instead the last ten years have seen an enormous flow of individual investor dollars back to Wall Street equities.  The number of stock and bond mutual funds has grown from 1,000 to over 7,000.  Consumers have undoubtedly been well served by the growth of Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar publications and various
 other stock market newsletters and business journals.  Publicly available data
-- objective, timely, and comprehensive -- on mutual funds and fund mangers performance has protected and greatly benefited consumers.  With this knowledge and
confidence the flow of investment dollars has created a much larger equities market (and paid for a lot of retirements and college tuitions!). Investors have been able to make intelligent decisions based on good data.

<a name="iv"></a>
<b><u>IV. The Role of Private Firms</H1>
</b></u><P>As private real estate information database companies developed in the 20th
century they have increasingly taken the burden off of the shoulders of local
government officials by publishing public record data from many government
agencies in hard-copy, on-line, microfiche and cd-rom media.   This has not only
reduced the costs of government by transferring the dissemination task to the
private sector but it has also provided more choice in the marketplace as a
number of firms competed to add value to the raw government data.  Today by and
large, the real estate marketplace looks to private sector information companies
to provide the tools and services that allow market value to be determined,
title condition to be analyzed, financing risks computed,  in short to
facilitate real property commerce.</P>
<p>
<a name="v"></a>
<b><u>V. Public Records and the Marketplace of Ideas</H1>
</b></u><P>After the Constitution was ratified by the thirteen original states, the
Founding Fathers drafted and the original American states adopted a Bill of
Rights to ensure the protection of fundamental freedoms.  The First of Ten
Amendments to the US Constitution guaranteed the right to free speech and
expression.  Having escaped persecution and oppression of a tyrannical monarch,
the Founding Fathers saw the value of a printing press to check government
tyranny.</P>
<P>Public records are not an exception to this fundamental core American
respect for and protection of free speech.  Access to public records serves the
same function.  Access to public records can directly protect consumers against
improper tax assessments and tax practices.  Access to public records can also
help protect buyers and sellers of property from unscrupulous operators.</P>
<p>
<a name="vi"></a>
<b><u>VI. Publicly Disseminated Real Estate Information Helps Safeguard the Public by
Deterring Fraud
</u></b>
<p>
        While Willie Sutton may have specialized in robbing banks because that was where the money was a half century ago, many unscrupulous individuals specialize in varieties of real estate fraud today.  Because of the large amounts of cash involved, the large number of people involved in the transaction and its complicated nature, and the widely dispersed ownership of real estate, there are abundant opportunites for fraud.  Fraud may be of the everyday garden variety where an elderly or unsophisticated seller is not provided full disclosure of relevant market trends and statistics or it may be of the more  nuanced type where fraudelent deeds of trust and sale are recorded on a property without the owner's consent.  In any case local, state, and federal law enforcement officials depend to a great degree on information from REIPA members for accurating reporting on real estate market events with the goal of bringing criminal fraud to light and protecting the consumer. Further restrcting access to the public records would just abet those perpetrators of fraud who already prey to easily on the unsuspecting.
<p>

<a name="vii"></a>
<p><b><u>VII. The Transition to an Information Age Refocuses the Issues</H1>
</b></u><P>The transition from an industrial to an information based economy has
refocused attention on the nature and purpose of public records and government
sourced information.  Information collected by the government when used wisely
creates real value for individuals and generates additional wealth for our
society.  At the same time we recognize that information used maliciously has
the potential to harm individuals.  We therefore need to seek appropriate
balances between the open use of information that has fueled the growth of our
economy along with the awareness that information may be used in a harmful way,
and devise and monitor appropriate safeguards.</P>
<P>Unfortunately  the unfolding democratic promises and practices of the
information age are under unremitting attacks in some quarters by government
bodies that seek to control and even severely limit access to the public's real
estate data in a number of ways.  These controlling efforts involve some of the
following: limiting access to  publicly sourced data, only releasing certain
pieces of it, charging exorbitantly for it,  giving exclusives to one party, and
claiming copyrights and demanding royalties.  All of these government efforts
result in the dissemination of real estate public record being limited and the
public's right to know impeded.  The real loser here is the public who will have
less data, and at a lower quality, when making decisions on buying, selling, and
financing real estate.  This means the public will be getting less and paying
more.  It is a profound threat to the health of real estate markets.</P>
<a name="viii"></a>
<p><b><u>VIII. Not All Government Collected Information is Public Record</H1>
</b></u><P>Governments, at the state, county,  and federal levels, collect lots of
information in fulfilling their myriad essential public purposes.  Information
is collected for school  records, professional licensing, taxing and recording
real property, to mention only a few purposes.  In some cases, the public
purpose for collecting information has historically included dissemination to
the public.  Real estate data fall into this class.  We would not have safe and
liquid real estate markets without a public real estate record built with public
dissemination in mind.  Moreover, those states and counties that are more open
in their release of real estate data  have stronger markets, more efficient
markets, more consumer oriented markets (all other things being equal) than
those areas which are data restrictive.  Quite simply, bad or non-existent
information leads to higher costs and bad decisions.</P>
<P>Other government data sets are collected without general public
dissemination being part of the public purpose for collection.  Medicaid or IRS
records are an example.  Still other records create real societal value when
disclosed, such as motor vehicle records, but were originally not collected with
dissemination in mind.</P>
<a name="ix"></a>
<P><b><u>IX. Government Sourced Data  Creates  Societal Wealth and Increased Tax
Revenues</b></u></P>
<P>The information base built by government dissemination of public records and
other private data sets is a basic infrastructure of our modern consumer
economy, just as canals were in the 19th century and roads have been in the 20th
century.  Moreover, they are an increasingly important part of the information
age infrastructure of the 21st century.  Every dollar invested by the government
in data sets that are shared with the public multiplies in employment in the
private sector, economic growth and tax revenue.  It is in the society's
interest for government to encourage and facilitate a vibrant and healthy
information industry, where the private sector is investing in new information
applications, and where no government agency or single private enterprise is
given a monopolistic advantage. </P>
<P>We advocate dissemination of government sourced data by commercial firms
committed to  Fair Information Values (FIV) and Practices (FIP).  REIPA believes
that information collected by government should be open and available unless
there is evidence that providing information to the public will harm individuals
 Furthermore, and just as important, REIPA believes that information disclosure
practices should be disclosed to the public when information is collected by the
government.  Government should also allow consumers to opt-out of the marketing
use of information, and should give other options where appropriate.</P>
<P>In a free and open society our opportunity to utilize the public record for
commercial purposes is balanced by our obligation to do this in a highly
responsible manner.  Our consumer society, marked by a high degree of personal
initiative, freedom and choice is based on consumer information. To this end we
not only assert the freedom of private firms to disseminate data, but also hold
up codes of responsible behavior for the information age. We recognize and
affirm that freedom implies responsibility.</P>
<a name="x"></a>
<b><u>X. The REI Providers Association</u></b>
<p>
        The REI Providers Association advocates dissemination of government sourced data by an information servicing industry which is committed to  Fair Information Values (FIV) and Practices (FIP).  REIPA believes that information collected by government should be open and available unless there is evidence that providing certain information sets to the public will harm, endanger or disadvantage individuals  Furthermore, and just as importantly, REIPA believes that information dissemination policies, practices and procedures should be disclosed to the public when information is collected by the government.  Agencies  should also allow consumers to opt-out of the marketing use of information, as is currently being introduced in the states in response to the Federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) of 1994.
<p>
        In a free and open society, our opportunity to utilize the public record for commercial purposes must be  balanced by our obligation to do this in a highly responsible manner.  Our service-oriented  society, marked by a high degree of personal initiative and  freedom to achieve limited only by one's abilities, is fueled by consumer information. To sustain long-lasting business success we must not only assert our unalienable rights to access and use of public data but also  be ever-mindful of our social obligations for responsible information handling. We recognize and affirm that freedom implies responsibility.  Moreover, the efforts required to maintain this ethical commitment should not be underestimated, because as the technological ability to create, commingle, and broadcast ever-enhanced strains of information continually expands, so do our moral obligations.
<p>



<a name="xi"></a>
<P><b><u>XI. Responsible Information  Handling </b></u></H1>
<P>REIPA members commit to and practice the highest level of responsible data
handling.  At REIPA we build services based on information that pertains to
millions of real estate parcels and their owners.  Accordingly, our members'
services are informed by REIPA's Fair Information Values (FIV) and Fair
Information Practices (FIP), which constitute rigorous self-regulation.</P>
<a name="xii"></a>
<p><b><u>XII. REIPA's Fair Information Values (FIV):</b></u>
<P>1)Partnership:We partner with customers to meet legitimate business needs.</P>
<P>2)Fairness:   We strive to meet consumer expectations about accuracy and
appropriate use of publicly sourced real estate information, and to be open and
honest in disclosing how that information is used.</P>
<P>3)Balance:   We only offer products and services that assure a favorable
balance of consumer benefits when weighed against privacy expectations.</P>
<P>4)Security:   We protect information from unauthorized access or alteration.</P>
<a name="xiii"></a>
<p><b><u>XIII. REIPA's Fair Information Practices (FIP):</b></u>
<P>1)Legal and ethical conduct: We commit to and practice the highest level of
legal and ethical conduct in dealing with customers, consumers and data
suppliers.</P>
<P>2)Reputable sources:  We acquire data from reputable sources -- within and
without the government -- and take reasonable precautions to ensure and maintain
the accuracy of that data.</P>
<P>3)Openness to consumers: Recognizing that consumers have an interest in the
information we maintain,  we will be open about the type of information stored,
where it was acquired, and how it is used.</P>
<P>4)Use of our data:   We will know how the information we provide our
customers is going to be used, and we will assure that it is not used to
disadvantage consumers.</P>
<a name="xiv"></a>
<P><b><u>XIV. Access to Publicly Sourced Real Estate Data Should be Unrestricted and
at the Cost of Reproduction</b></u>
<P>Accordingly, based on  society's need for information and our responsible
use, we affirm the traditional American practices and values of open records:
</P>
<P>1) Access to publicly sourced real estate data should be  unrestricted.
Information companies are challenged to add value to it and rigorously practice
responsible use.   </P>
<P>2)The cost should be that of efficient reproduction in paper and/or computer
time, staff and materials.  The government does not exist to subsidize the
private sector, neither should it make the public record into a &quot;profit
center&quot;, nor initiate new programs based on the speculative prospect of
selling government data, nor should it seek to radically limit the release of
data fields in the publicly sourced data; nor should it demand royalties from
dubious copyright claims, nor enter into exclusive licensing arrangements; all
of which practices have the effect of restricting access to the public record
and producing a less efficient and innovative real estate marketplace.</P>
<a name="xv"></a>
<b><u>XV. Government Information Dissemination Principles
</u></b>
<p>
        Governments at all levels should adopt information dissemination positions governed by a set of principles including:
<ol>
<li> The government does not exist to subsidize the private sector, nor should it
attempt to compete against it;
<li> the public record should not be turned into an agency's  "profit center",
<li> agencies should not initiate new programs based on the speculative prospect of selling government data;
<li> agencies should not limit the release of data fields in the publicly sourced
data, unless there is a compelling threat of individual harm or disadvantage;
<li> agencies should not demand royalties nor claim copyright on public record data;
<li> agencies should not enter into exclusive licensing arrangements;
All of these practices have the effect of restricting access to the public record and producing a less efficient and innovative real estate marketplace. Moreover because they harm the free market and damage commercial businesses they retard
 tax collections and the creation of jobs.
</ol><p>


<a name="xvi"></a>
<p><b><u>XVI. Ongoing Study</b></u>
<P>Moving forward, REIPA is committed to responsible use of public data. 
REIPA's members know that information can be abused.  Thus, REIPA is studying
the impact of free flowing information so that the highest professional and
ethical standards for the use of information are disseminated to its members.

<P><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<p>
<em><center>ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION UNDER ATTACK</center></em><p></strong>
<em>REI Industry Forum to be held in San Francisco</em>
<P><em><strong>Washington, D.C., September 25 </strong></em>~ The emerging information age has found
government agencies seeking to limit access to public information, according to
Professor Earl Epstein of Ohio State University.  Open access to information is
an integral element in the nature and extent of citizen participation in the
economy and politics, Epstein claims.  It is a tradition that dates back to the
time of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson.  Efforts by state and local governments
to control the terms and conditions of access to public information is a serious
encroachment on this fundamental principle of our democracy.</P>
<P>Professor Epstein will be one of the featured speakers at the Annual
Business Meeting and 1996 Fall Conference of the REI Providers Association
(REIPA) scheduled to take place October 26 - 27, 1996 at the Westin St. Francis
Hotel in San Francisco, California.  He will join Roger Hurlbert of Sage
Information Services and Rufus Lusk, III of Experion Property Data on the
keynote session entitled &quot;Access to Public Information.&quot;</P>
<P>The two day program also features a session on the use of geographic and
spatial information titled, &quot;GIS is More than Maps.&quot;  Panelists
include Lynn Sites, DataQuick Information Systems;  Dan Cotter, Transamerica
Information Services;  and Steve Trammel, ESRI.  &quot;The Changing Face and
Pace of the Appraisal Industry&quot; will be addressed by Barry Bates, Vice
President and Chief Appraiser for The Money Store; and Mark Keegan, Senior Vice
President of  Lender's Services, Inc. Moderating the panel will be Howard Sears,
MAI, SRA, President, Market Data Research, Inc.  Other sessions include a
program on personal data as it relates to real property transactions entitled, &quot;Demographics:
 Putting the 'Who' into 'Where' &quot;; a session on information sourcing
through the World Wide Web entitled, &quot;Internet/Intranet Tools &amp;
Technology Trends&quot;; and a program aimed at real estate information
providers entitled &quot;Creating Proprietary Commercial Property Databases.&quot;
 As a special feature of the Conference, Cameron King, Executive Vice President,
Electronic Commerce, Countrywide Home Loans, will present an overview of the
role of real estate information in the mortgage industry.   </P>
<P>On Sunday, October 27, REIPA will present its Venture Fair, including a
Company and Product Showcase.  This marketplace of real estate information
products and services will feature companies with innovative and emerging
products as well as a chance for industry members to review partnership and
investment opportunities.  More than eighty investment, banking and venture
capital firms have been invited to attend.</P>
<P>Registration for the Conference is open to REIPA members and non-members
alike.  Those interested in attending should contact the REI Providers
Association at (202) 328-7460, by fax at (202) 332-2301, or via e-mail at

Ideas</strong></font></font></p>
<hr>
<p align=center><img src="eagle1.jpg" align=bottom></p>
<hr>
<p>Auburn Drive High School is located in a new subdivision in Cole 
Harbour and draws its students from both the rural heritage of historic 
Halifax County and the modern suburban growth of Dartmouth. The 
mix in many ways parallels the hopes for the school, to combine the 
past and the future into a unique educational facility for the present.</p>
<p>Feeder schools for Auburn Drive are Graham Creighton, Astral Drive, 
and Gaetz Brook Junior Highs. Graham Creighton, the region's first high 
school before the construction of Cole Harbour District High, serves 
the suburban areas of Westphal as well as the tradition-rich 
Afro-Canadian communities of East Preston and Cherry Brook. 
Contrasting with historic Graham Creighton, the youthful exuberance of 
Astral Drive reflects its role as one of the youngest and fastest growing 
schools in Nova Scotia. Its students are mainly drawn from the Colby 
Village development and adjacent subdivisions and in a few short years 
the school has grown to challenge Graham Creighton's traditional lead 
in academic excellence, music and sports. Gaetz Brook, located amid 
the beauty of the Eastern Shore, will send some of its graduates to 
Auburn Drive. These will come mainly form the Lake Echo region, an 
area known internationally for its aquatic sports and the producer of 
several national and world champions.</p>
<p>The nature of these schools reflects the diversity of the human resources 
at Auburn Drive High. To fully meet the needs of its students at the 
close of the 20th century and into the 21st, the school will minimize the 
concept of education within the confines of walled classrooms. The 
needs of the students will be combined with those of teachers, 
community, and the world beyond, each contributing to the education of 
the other on a cross referenced network of learning. As a part of this 
commitment, educational partnerships have been formed with Pratt and 
Whitney, Maritime Tel and Tel, Royal Bank Of Canada, and technical 
courses will combine the community and the school in unique learning 
activities. The compulsory Exploring Technology course at the Grade 
Ten level will introduce students to many of the learning activities. The 
award-winning Applied Broadcast Journalism and Applied 
Broadcasting Technology courses link their services as well as other 
programs to the school, to the community, province, nation and 
beyond.</p>
<p>As a communications and educational hub, Auburn Drive High School 
will be reaching out and at the same time drawing in to create a new, 
flexible type of school and a new way of learning needed to face 
present and future educational challenges.</p>

<p align=center><b><u>BISHOP'S UNIVERSITY</u></b></p>
<p>Bishop's University is a place you go to have a good time and to get an education. Bishop's has a 
reputation as a party school. Yes, they provide adequate academics, but so do a lot of other 
schools. People come to Bishop's to get away from their parents, enjoy the football and to party.</p>
<p>One of the most liked things about Bishop's University is its small size. Total enrollment is only a 
meager 2500. This, combined with the small quiet town of Lennoxville, Quebec, provides a real 
sense of community. Class sizes are small with most first year classes not bigger than 35 students. 
Fourth year are generally under 20. With this small a University, the professors know your name, 
not your number. This small size does have its downfalls however, privacy is limited and the dating 
pool is small (very active however).</p>
<p>Academically, Bishop's will provide you with an education that you will need in the future. Bishops 
specialty is Business Administration, Psychology and Political Sciences. The school allows you to 
pick a wide variety of courses and you are not required to pick a major in your first year. 
Information on the courses available can be found on Bishop's homepage on the internet. The 
most popular bird courses are Canadian Economic development and Acting 101.</p>
<p>Back to the parties. There are two main places on campus to party and drink - The Pub (huge 
building, loud music, lots of people) and The Quiet Bar ( pool table, televisions, rock videos and 
regular party music). When there is a party, everyone knows about it. Residence parties are big 
events which usually have themes such as Octoberfest, or the famous naked parties and the 
belly-button shooter party. (the names tell all). The parties got so rowdy in the all male residences, 
they were made Co-Ed in an attempt to calm them down. The University has been working on 
ways of calming down the parties in order to lift its reputation. ( fight the power)</p>
<p>Sports are a big part of Bishop life. The Plex is the big athletics facility where everyone comes to 
workout and exercise. The football team &quot;Gaiters? is the pride and joy of the school and fans 
follow them where ever they play. For those not into sports and such, there are many extra 
curricular activities and clubs in the University.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Bishop's provides a good mix of education and fun to make a most memorable 
college experience.</p>

<p><font size=4>I'm not sure what I really want to say to you, and it will probably not make a 
difference anyway. I was told everything you're about to read and it still 
happened to me. I want to talk about Anorexia, Bulimia, diet pills and my 
experiences with them. I think there are many misconceptions when it comes to 
eating disorders. In particular the image we have of an anorexic or bulimic 
person. For the most part bulimic's are average size, some are even 
overweight. This is due to the fact that they usually binge on junk food, and 
when they throw-up they retain the fat. People also usually picture anorexics as 
90 pounds, frail, shallow skin with their hair falling out, which will happen after 
time. What people don't understand is that it can take anywhere from one 
month to ten years to get to that point. In my mind, I still believe that I'm not, 
and have never been Anorexic, because I never got sick, frail or ended up in 
the hospital. I threw-up my food for the first time in grade five. I didn't 
understand why I did, it may sound weird, but it just kind of happened. I 
stopped for a while in grade six, then I entered Junior High. I went through a 
vicious cycle at times I would eat normally, then I would start to throw-up, and 
then stop eating all together, this continued for about three and a half years. In 
my mind, I did not have and never have been anorexic, because I can still and 
always have been able to function as a normal person. So then around the 
middle of grade ten, I stopped all my bad eating habits, which is all I thought 
they were. Then I entered grade 11. At this point I found my so-called 
&quot;wonder drug&quot; diet pills. I call them drugs because even though there is no 
proof, I feel that they are extremely addictive. I feel they should definitely be 
illegal. If I didn't take them I would shake, scream, have violent mood swings 
and do anything I could to get more.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>So with what I've told you, you probably assume that my parents and friends 
knew or know now. Only a couple of my friends know. As for my parents and 
family, they have no clue. I cut back on my pill use on my own. I have no idea 
how. Now I use them only about once a month. I have not thrown up in about 
six months, and have not starved myself for about one year. I have never been 
to a councillor. Why would I? They are only for people who have or had a 
problem, and I never have had one. It's very hard to explain. I knew that when 
I threw-up my food I was bulimic and when I staved myself I was anorexic, 
but in a strange way I didn't and still don't see what's wrong with it. Nothing 
bad ever happened to me, and I stayed thin. I was in control of something in 
my life&#133; my body. I wanted to be 110 pounds so I was. If I dropped below I 
would eat again. If I went up I would starve. If I ate junk food I got rid of it. I 
have never seen myself as fat, because I'm not and have never been, for me it 
was having control over a least one part of my life. But I don't, and never have 
had, control of anything. From the first moment it controlled me. I eat on a 
regular basis now. I don't know why I stopped or how I was able to. In my 
mind I know I'm still sick, and one day I will relapse. For me, having an eating 
order is very much like being a drug addict. I have not hit bottom yet, and I 
may never, so therefore I do not have a problem.</font> </p>

<title>How Women Have Betrayed Women - Lori Mackay</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><font size=4>How Women Have Betrayed Women</font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4>By: Lori MacKay </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>What is feminism? Do we still even need it in this day and age? Is it </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>misinterpreted? Is it about an individual or a group? Does it search for 
common </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>ground or does it support diversity? I guess it depends on who you ask, 
because </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>unfortunately there is no one term or correct definition of the word. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>In general, feminism is defined as &quot;a woman's point of view on a certain </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>issue.&quot; We accept that there are different schools of thought within Feminism, 
and </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>they are not all of equal value. Most feminists tend to believe in social, legal 
and </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>economic equality for both men and women. There are some women who 
believe </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>that all women are victims of male patriarchal oppression, and oppose all 
things </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>&quot;male?, including &quot;male? science and rationality. However, I feel that this is 
almost </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>a non issue anymore, simply because most women have about the same 
chance as </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>any man in this world. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>There is, however, one thing I feel women must over come in order to keep </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>on progressing the way we have been, and this is the way we treat each other. 
It </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>seems that the young women today have forgotten the Feminism and struggles 
of </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>such women as Mary Wollstonecraft, Dr. Emily Howard-Stowe, Margaret </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Anderson, Gloria Steinem, Naomi Wolf, , Betty Friedan, Kate Millett and Nellie </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>McClung, or is it simply the fact that most young girls have never heard of 
them. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Feminism seems to have become a dirty word used only by lesbians and men </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>haters. Women seem to have lost their respect for each other, and somewhat 
for </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>themselves. I would like you to pitcure if you would four or five high school 
girls </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>standing around talking, when another girl walks by who may be a little larger. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Chances are someone will say something to or about her. Most of the things I 
hear </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>said around girls in school seem harmless such as, &quot;Will you look at her hair?, </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>&quot;What a Beast?, &quot;Okay no, you just don't wear that?, or &quot;She is such a bitch?. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Now even I will admit to saying things like this, but what's the harm if I don't 
say </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>them to her face? The harm is saying them at all, who cares if someone is not </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>wearing an outfit you like, everyone is different. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Women are trying to live up to an ideal that no one can attain, so who set </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>these standards Men or women? I believe both are to blame almost equally. 
Some </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>women seem to feel empowered by belittling others. It's these people who are </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>insecure themselves. But in our society who can't help but feel insecure when 
we </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>are being bombarded with unattainable computer altered pitchures of so-called </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>perfect people, who for the most part feel bad about themselves anyway 
because </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>most are either anorexic or on heroin. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>The women's rights (Feminism) movement was a lot simpler when all they </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>had to fight for was political, social and economic equality for women. Among </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>these rights were control of property, equality of operation in education and </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>employment, suffrage, and sexual freedom. They (women) were fighting 
together </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>for a common goal, unlike today where we seem to be against one another. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>Women need to put away all their jealousies, bias, insecurities and work </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>together to improve life for future generations. I know I don't want to live in a </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>world where woman on woman crimes, plastic surgery, and anorexia are the 
norm. </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>But how can we stop what is happening to us? These are not problems that 
can be </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>solved in the legal area like the Feminist of the early 1900's did. Unfortunately I </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>don't have the answers although I wish I did. Maybe next time you see a young </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>woman who is different in her own way, just respect her for who she is, 
because no </font></p>
<p align=left><font size=4>one is perfect. </font></p>

<title>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT - Brad Traves</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><u>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</u></p>
<p align=center>-Brad Traves</p>
<p>Capital punishment is the only penalty that is fit for murder. It has been used for thousands of 
years and is currently supported by 80 per cent of Americans. Allowing a convicted murderer to 
carry on with their life, with the exception of freedom is unacceptable. Murderers pose a serious 
threat to society and should be dealt with accordingly. I share this view with United States 
President Bill Clinton who has let it be known he will nominate no one to the Federal bench who 
is opposed to capital punishment under all circumstances. Clearly, the death penalty is used only in 
the most extreme and horrible cases of murder. During the time of the first US colonists, a criminal 
could be sentenced to death for 150 different crimes including robbery, counterfeiting, witchcraft, 
arson, slave rebellion, and even some forms of lying. Today's society no longer accepts these 
crimes as capital offenses, and rightly so. Murder is now the only crime recognized as a capital 
offense. Murderers are criminally aberrant individuals and should be punished by death.</p>
<p>There are two sides to capital punishment. One is either for it or against it. Supporters suggest, 
&quot;death is the fitting punishment for murder, and executions maximize public safety through 
incapacitation and deterrence.? Opponents believe &quot;...there is no evidence that the murder rate 
fluctuates according to the frequency with which the death penalty is used...also object that <i>lex 
talionis</i> (&quot;a life for a life?) is not a sound principle of the criminal justice--that society cannot allow 
the brutalities of criminal violence to set the limits of appropriate punishments.? Another popular 
argument against capital punishment is that the innocent may be executed. However, Scott 
Newark, spokesman for the Canadian Police Association, says, &quot;I was a prosecutor for twelve 
years and I tell you, you have to do a fair amount to be convicted of first-degree murder.? There 
must be some kind of punishment available to deal with individuals who have committed horrible 
crimes against society and are beyond rehabilitation. These individuals have exploited their rights 
and destroyed the lives of their victims and their families who are left to grieve and try to come to 
terms with why a human being could do so to another.</p>
<p>Capital punishment serves multiple purposes. The first being justice. It helps bring peace of mind 
to the victim's family, also to society which no longer has to worry about that particular individual. 
Also, the convicted criminal is severely punished for the terrible crime they have committed. The 
hours leading up to their execution should be a dreadful experience. Hopefully, it would cause 
them as much pain and suffering as their victim(s) experienced. </p>
<p>There is an overwhelming support amongst Canadians for the reinstatement of capital punishment. 
Jean Chretien and his friends in Ottawa should seriously consider legislating the death penalty, as 
most Canadians are in favour of it. If we had it, a certain Paul Bernardo would be sitting on death 
row right now. Think about what he did. Now think of capital punishment. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><b>Child Molesters . . . why do we let them out of prison?</b></font></p>
<p align=center>by Sara Guilcher</p>
<p align=center>Recently in the media much attention has been given to child molesters. Richard MacFarlane has 
been in the public eye lately because he had breached the conditions of his release in that he 
moved near an elementary school in Rockingham. Hector Jesso, a violent sex offender, was just 
released from the Kingston Penitentiary in Ontario after serving 14 years. He was planning to live 
in Newfoundland so RCMP officials warned residents in the area. He could have as easily chosen 
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. There has also been another admitted pedophile in the media lately, 
Ernest Warner. Ernest Warner was charged with 25 counts of stalking, sexual assault, attempted 
abduction, and the list goes on. He pleaded guilty to four stalking charges and served only two 
years in prison. After his release, Warner applied to become a foster parent and he was 
accepted! How can an admitted pedophile become a foster parent? </p>
<p>I am so grateful that I had a safe childhood and as I look at these incidents I am concerned for the 
children. Shouldn't someone be afraid? Why do we let these sick perverts dance along through life 
and get a second, and third, and fourth chance where they destroy the innocence of our youth? 
We let these monsters get away with so much it sickens me. We want to be known as a kind and 
forgiving society so we let them out of prison but yet we don't trust them. This is evident through 
the commotion that a pedophile generates when he or she moves into an area. Residents, 
especially parents, get upset and worried and don't want the pedophile living there. Why does the 
community worry and feel vulnerable, when after all, we forgave them as a society and we 
supposedly trust them enough to let them out of prison? We &quot; trust &quot; them but we don't want 
pedophiles living near schools, where children are easily accessible. It doesn't take a brain to 
figure out that children are everywhere, who's to say that these pedophiles won't go to another 
public place like the mall and find children? Why don't we trust these pedophiles? History has 
shown us not to... pedophiles often repeat their crimes over and over again until they build up their 
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that we finally realize that yes these people are DANGEROUS. Despite our lenient 
justice system, none of us want to live with the consequences of our judicial system. </p>
<p>In California, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a law in September of 1996 that required repeat child 
molesters to be chemically castrated. California is the first state to make this bold and courageous 
move. Finally we are fighting back and actually punishing these offenders. This step taken applies 
to molesters who commit a second crime against a child under the age of 13. They must receive 
weekly injections of Depo-Provera, a drug that dampens sexual desire. European countries have 
used this method and the rate of repeat-offender has dropped from 100% to 2%.</p>
<p>We are wasting money and time by allowing sex offenders out of jail unimpeded. Castrate them all 
or throw away the key. Let them feel what it is like to feel helpless and have their freedom and 
innocence taken away. </p>

<title>Coke or Pepsi? - Chrisitne Emberly </title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center>Coke&#153; or Pepsi&#153;?</p>
<p align=center>Christine Emberley	</p>
<p>It's an ongoing debate. Since there have been two different colas, there has been controversy over 
which is better. Coke&#153; is certainly more widespread. It has been around since the late 1800's 
and there probably isn't a continent on the planet that hasn't seen a can of it at one time or 
another. But in the past decade, Pepsi&#153; has been claiming that it's more popular. It's had its 
Pepsi Taste Test&#153;, which was a huge success. According to their statistics, more than 60% of 
participants chose Pepsi&#153; over Coke&#153;. But in Georgia (where Coke was &quot;invented&quot;, in 
Atlanta), you wouldn't find a can of Pepsi in a single store.</p>
<p>So, we here at Auburn Times want to know&#133; which do you prefer? Coke&#153; or Pepsi&#153;? This is 
an official A.T. poll, and your input would be greatly appreciated. E-mail us at 
941096@adhs.ednet.ns.ca with one of the following choices; Coke, Pepsi, Other (Please 
Specify), or Doesn't Matter.</p>

<title>Current Affairs - Survey - Wade MacDonald</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><b>Current Affairs - Survey</b></p>
<p>About 3 weeks ago I decided to run a survey within Auburn Drive High School's newly 
established e-mail system. Since all students have access to e-mail, I thought this was a good 
medium to post a survey, and I was quite impressed with the results. Here are the results to the 
survey, &quot;How the CBC cuts affect high school students?.</p>
<p>I will first start off with the facts, which some of you may or may not know. Late in the day on 
Thursday, September 19, 1996, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's President, Perrin 
Beatty, announced to CBC employees and various media the cuts which the CBC would face 
over the nest 18 months. The cuts which face the CBC all have to do with </p>
<p>the Government reducing spending on the Crown Corporation. Examples of the cuts include $127 
million cut from their annual budget, bringing the total cuts in budget up to $414 million since 
1995. Furthermore, 2500 jobs are to be lost, totalling about 4000 since 1995. Although there will 
be no closures of local stations, there will be program changes. Locally produced shows such as 
&quot;Up on the Roof&quot; (on the English TV network) and &quot;Mainstreet&quot; (on English Radio) are thought to 
be on the chopping block. CBC also wants to achieve it's original mandate by September, 1998, 
with an all Canadian television network, cutting all American shows at all times of the day.</p>
<p>I didn't know what reaction I would get from high school students on this subject, but I was 
pleased with the 19% reply rate. 29 out of 150 randomly chosen students replied, and this is what 
they had to say about the CBC.</p>
<p>To start off, I asked how had been aware of the cuts before they happened. 19 students said they 
knew about the cuts. </p>
<p>I wanted to know about the viewing and listening habits of the students, and I asked several 
questions on the subject. I found out that nearly 59% of respondents watched the English 
television network on a regular basis. 7% rarely watched. With radio, I wasn't really surprised to 
find that the vast majority of respondents rarely listened to the service, with the remainder tuning in 
now and then. However, with the CBC Stereo service, it pleased me to find 7% listened to it on a 
regular basis. About 83% rarely listened. </p>
<p>Since Canada is a bilingual country, and the CBC reflects this, I asked about the French services. 
7% tuned in to French television, in addition to 7% who both listened to French radio and 
watched French TV. </p>
<p>In conclusion to the survey, I asked the students if they felt CBC should aim more programming 
towards the younger generation. The vast majority, 79%, wanted programming based towards 
their own age, while the remainder, 21%, felt the CBC should not change its programming 
towards this generation. </p>
<p>Additional comments were welcome, and were received. Here are a few of those which I 
received.</p>
<p>CBC should focus more on our generation because we are the future. We </p>
<p>need to learn as much as we can now about future jobs etc. CBC should </p>
<p>focus more on teen issues and stop treating &quot;our&quot; problems as no big </p>
<p>deal. Teenagers are often portrayed as the problem in society there </p>
<p>should be less age discrimination in the media in general.</p>
<p>I think the CBC is far too regulated to be a successful media </p>
<p>force in today's society. The only way it will attract more interest </p>
<p>is if it breaks free of Canadian Government regulations and sponsors </p>
<p>people-oriented programming, instead of educational programming. I </p>
<p>rarely watch TV so it makes little difference to me, but that's the </p>
<p>way I see it. :)</p>
<p>I don' believe they should be cutting CBC at all. In my opinion CBC is </p>
<p>watched by more people I know then any other channel. </p>
<p>I think that there should be more programs for our </p>
<p>generation, but not solely our generation. It should have a balanced </p>
<p>variety so that it will appeal to more people and perhaps then the </p>
<p>cuts won't be necessary</p>
<p>I believe that the CBC offers a valuable service to the </p>
<p>Canadian people and culture. SRC offers good programming of a </p>
<p>professional nature in french. This is something hard to find on </p>
<p>other french networks. Both CBC and SRC provide the Canadian and </p>
<p>Maritime views on several issues. This not available on American </p>
<p>stations and is not shown enough on various other Canadian stations </p>
<p>such as CTV and MITV. </p>
<p>They want to make it more&quot;Canadian&quot;,and that is a good idea </p>
<p>THEORETICALLY, but people are not going to watch something unless they </p>
<p>want to. They probably won't watch it just because it is Canadian. </p>
<p>They should concentrate on Canadian shows, but don't rule out the </p>
<p>American shows altogether.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all those who participated in the survey; it was a great help! :) My next 
survey, which I will be sending out on Monday (***subject to approval***) will be on the Justice 
system... the perception of it and the Young Offenders Act, from a high school standpoint. </p>
<p>Also, the results of this survey are being sent to the CBC radio program &quot;As It Happens?, a 
current affairs program on CBC Radio (90.5 FM in Halifax), airing Monday to Friday from 6:30 
to 8:00 PM. </p>

<title>DENNIS' LIFE? DENNIS' STATE OF BEING - Dennis Mitchell</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><b>DENNIS' LIFE? DENNIS' STATE OF BEING</b></p>
<p>Hello again?... If there is anyone reading this? And if someone does read this please leave a 
comment because without your thoughts this writing may as well be on a piece of paper one 
million galaxies away, nowhere near intelligent life. (Not that you have to be intelligent to read 
anything I write.) So please if you do read it, I want feed back.</p>
<p>I was sitting in my friend's car, travelling without a cause or destination one night. The music was 
turned up, and my mind was tuned out. We drove up the crest of a large hill, and I could see a 
large part of the city. It was evening, and the lights made it seem alive. The feeling I felt was 
unexplainable. It was deeper than happy, not like when you're excited about something or when 
you meet someone new, or even when you accomplish something. I think, at that moment, if the 
universe were ripped in half, like looseleaf, I wouldn't care. I knew the city and those lights meant 
nothing, and the car I was in meaningless. Everything in my entire life that I ever thought of as 
important, or worried about, meant nothing at this moment. Everything concrete in my mind fell 
like broken glass. But, there was no feeling of being lost, or alone. I had this terrific force of 
motivation to do something great and express myself, and I knew deep down, that if I did this, my 
life would unfold. I also realized that I was the only one controlling my fate, except fate itself, and I 
decided to enjoy every moment I could because I was surrounded by all the uncertainties, and no 
matter what decision I made, it would be all right.</p>
<p>After writing this, and reading it over several times, I wondered if other people had a turning point 
in their life, and I decided that if there<i> was</i> a turning point<b> </b>in anyone's life, this was my turning 
point, and I had a direction. </p>
<p>I would tell you what my direction was, if I thought it would make a difference, but I want you to 
find your own path, because all decisions you make, if they are not for you, and don't come from 
your heart, you may die in some strangers bed, not knowing who you are. </p>
<p>You may wonder, what if I fail at what I love? Then I'll tell you: I would rather die an unsuccessful 
painter if that's what I like, than make one million dollars a day feeling meaningless, and wondering 
why I spend all those years of education to do something that has no meaning in someone else's 
life, <i>or mine</i>. I believe, that even if I knew now that I wouldn't make a cent doing what I like, I 
wouldn't stop for anything. And, I believe in myself, and know that I will die in my own bed, 
copious and complete by my own fate, fate itself. </p>

<p align=center><u>Scholarships made Easy</u></p>
<p align=center>By: Rodney MacDonald</p>
<p align=center>Well here it is, November already and everybody's talking about the future. Most people are 
finally realizing that this is their last year of high school and that they don't know where they will be 
one year from now. Everybody knows that to go anywhere nowadays you need to go to 
university, but have you thought about how you're going to pay for it? Sure, you could get a loan, 
and spend the next decade or so buried under debt. But there is a much easier way to go. Let the 
university pay! Scholarships are everywhere, and are just waiting to be claimed by ambitious 
students like you! What's that you say? Your marks are only so-so? You don't play sports? 
You're a social reject who doesn't participate in<i> anything</i>? No problem! Just print out the letter 
below, fill it out, and send it off to the school of your choice. Then just sit back and let the cash 
flow in. Easy as a cheezie! (WARNING!! Void where prohibited. May constitute fraud in some 
areas. Use of this letter relieves the author of any legal responsibility. Use at your own risk.)</p>
<p>Detach and $AVE $AVE $AVE!!!</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>I am writing in application for <u>(scholarship of choice)</u>. I possess many virtues which I believe 
would make me the ideal candidate for your award.</p>
<p>My name is <u>(your name).</u> I am a grade twelve student at Auburn Drive High School, where I have 
attained an average of 99.4%. I take only honors courses. If no honors course is offered, I 
provide my own extra credit work. I am heptalingual, speaking English, French, Swedish, Italian, 
Cantonese, Spanish and Japanese, all fluently. I am president of every club at my school, and I 
play the bassoon in my school band. Last year, I was invited to play with the Berlin Philharmonic 
Orchestra. Several times over the years, I have been urged to skip ahead a few grades. I, 
however have chosen to stay put, simply for the love of learning.</p>
<p>Outside of school, I work with many charitable organizations. I help the old, the poor (or &quot;the 
dirty people&quot;, as I like to call them), and homeless abused dolphins and koala bears. I always 
recycle and often pick through the garbage at the dump for objects that can be re-used or 
recycled. I hold down a part time job as a junior partner in a law firm. Last month, I prevented the 
deportation of thirty refugees.</p>
<p>I am an active participant in the arts community. Last year, I wrote a play and staged it on 
Broadway. It won seven Tony awards, including best actor (me, of course). I love sports. I am a 
ninth-degree black belt in four martial arts. Last summer, I swam across Lake Superior and 
climbed Mount Everest. Physically, my weight is in exact proportion to my height. My teeth are 
perfectly straight, and when seen from the proper angle, radiate light. My hair smells like apple 
pie.</p>
<p>I love Canada, rainbows, puppies and church. I love all people, except those who use the word 
&quot;can't&quot;.</p>
<p>So, please consider me for your scholarship. I would obviously be an asset to your university.</p>

<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p>M&amp;M'S</p>
<p>QUESTION AND ANSWER	</p>
<p>QUESTION:	<i>A friend told me about a guy she thought would be perfect for me. </i></p>
<p><i>Should I call him for myself, or should I ask my friend to set up a blind date? </i></p>
<p><i>If I call him, what should I say?</i></p>
<p>ANSWER:	Ask your friend which procedure she thinks this &quot;perfect&quot; guy</p>
<p>prefers. Either way, your friend must talk to this guy, to make sure he wants to </p>
<p>meet you. If you do end up calling him, check to make sure your path is clear.</p>
<p>For starters say something like: &quot;Did Lisa say I'd be calling?&quot;, then say something</p>
<p>he wants to hear like: &quot;I hear you wanted to see this movie, I've been dying to see</p>
<p>it myself&quot;. If you are to shy to say something like that, say something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;It feels strange to be calling someone I've never met before, I hope you don't </p>
<p>mind&quot; . He will appreciate your honesty, and he will reassure you that he doesn't </p>
<p>mind you calling him (unless he does then he probably will tell you).</p>
<p>If the conversation goes well, casually mention that you would like to </p>
<p>get together (like if your going to a party, invite him to). Try not to take it </p>
<p>personally if your friend's idea of a &quot;dream guy&quot; turns out to be your worst nightmare, </p>
<p>she is trying to do you a favour and thank her for it.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU WOULD LIKE US TO ANSWER:</p>
<p>WRITE TO 941119. ( or for outside people: 941119 @adhs.ednet.ns.ca) </p>

<title>THE JOY OF DRIVING A JUNKER - Melanie Coffey</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><b><u>THE JOY OF DRIVING A JUNKER</u></b></p>
<p align=center><b>By: Melanie Coffey</b><b><u> </u></b></p>
<p align=center>As I fly down the highway in my faded and severely dented 1987 Firefly with music blaring out of 
the one speaker that works, I find that I am pitying those with glamorous, unscratched vehicles. 
Their lives would be so much easier if they just understood the joys of driving a junker.</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about having a faded paint job is that you never need to wash it because it 
looks the same either way. Likewise, when the car is scratched and dented, you never have to 
worry about your car being &quot;keyed?&quot; because you'd probably never notice. Another plus is the 
found ease in parking lots. Now, those poor souls with their brand new and flawless cars are 
forced to get out of their car when a shopping cart blocks their way. With my car, I just rev the 
engine and push the cart out of the way. I've noticed that all you nice-car owners get very jealous.</p>
<p>When a new paint job is needed, all you poor suckers may spend hundreds of dollars on a great 
custom job while all I need is a can of spray paint. With the spray paint technique, there is no 
waiting for your car to come out of the shop.</p>
<p>Repairs on a junky car are usually less frequent and less expensive. Let me explain this often 
confused fact that a few new-car owners understand. If a part is not considered &quot;vital&quot; to the 
actual running of the car, you can either ignore it or get rid of it. Interior problems? Ripped seats? 
Have no fear, all you need is an old sheet and a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p>Having a stained and ripped interior is a luxury too few people get to experience. For example, if 
after you stop by McDonalds for the &quot;Large-size? meal, you turn a corner and spill it, your only 
worries are your clothes and the money spent on the wasted meal. Eating in your car is never a 
problem. With your beat-up car you never need to worry about where to put the trash: when 
you're done just whip it in back.</p>
<p>The one and only down side to my car, except the &quot;matchbox car&quot; comments from your friends, is 
the no longer working gas gauge. You simply have to rely on instinct, or the simple fact that your 
car just stops, to know when it is time to fill the tank. </p>
<p>Besides the listed extras, a beat-up car is a lot more fun to drive. They are a lot less hassle than 
new ones and much more exciting. My car may not be pretty to look at, but it is always an 
adventure.</p>

<P><B> STS analyzes mutual fund price patterns to identify short-term trends.
It uses Gil Blake's ideas as well as proprietary methods using elements
of chaos theory and statistics. (Blake is a highly successful mutual funds
switcher. He was interviewed in the bestselling book <A HREF="schwager.sht"><IMG SRC="anibook.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=37></A><A HREF="schwager.sht">
<I>The New Market Wizards</I> by Jack Schwager</A>.)</B></P>

<P><B> Although price behavior is mostly random in the short-term (one
month), our research has identified several mutual funds with a 70% to
80% probability of <I>trend persistency</I>.</B></P>

<P><B> The STS system concentrates on Fidelity Select sector funds because
they exhibit the most predictable short-term trendiness. (Also, once the
initial 3% load is paid, Fidelity does not charge to switch between different
Selects.)</B></P>

<P><B> <A NAME="main4a"></A>Following the STS system, you would hold a
Select fund <A HREF="minirule.sht">about 32 days</A> on average and then
switch to another STS-chosen fund. The system has been carefully designed
to avoid Fidelity's 0.75% penalty charge for early (less than 30 days)
withdrawal. As a safeguard, since the system has a 20% downside probability,
we also have a volatility-dependent <A HREF="stoploss.sht">stop loss.</A></B></P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Ever heard of Gil Blake?</H4>

<P>He is a very successful mutual funds switcher who consistently achieves
30-40% annual returns with little downside volatility. He is one of the
&quot;wizards&quot; in the best-selling book <A HREF="schwager.sht"><I>The
New Market Wizards</I> by Jack Schwager.</A></P>

<P> His ideas are easy to understand. In the early 1980s he noticed that,
although in general stocks and mutual funds behave randomly day-to-day,
some of the mutual funds, especially Fidelity Select sector funds, have
a high probability -- about 70-80 percent -- of staying in the same direction
for one or two days after the daily price change exceeds the average daily
change for that fund. He calls this high probability the <I>persistency</I>
of a trend.</P>

<P> </P>

<H4>We checked it out</H4>

<P>We tested this concept and agree with Blake. Of all fund families, Fidelity
Selects have the best persistency of trend. (We also looked into stocks
and commodities, but they don't have any significant persistency.)</P>

<P> Unfortunately, in the mid 1980s Fidelity changed the rules. To curtail
short-term switching (and Blake hints in the book that due to his success
he may have been a culprit), they imposed the above-mentioned short-term
redemption penalty of 0.75%, which destroys the system.</P>

<P> Blake does not say how he got around this barrier, but to this day
he continues to rack up 30% to 40% returns each year. (Various financial
publications, Investor Business Daily newspaper among them, periodically
publish results of investment championships and his name and his returns
are always there.)</P>

<P> </P>

<H4>Our Extension of Blake's Methods</H4>

<P>After experimenting with many ideas, we hit on a simple extension of
Blake's idea: <I>instead of looking at day-by-day changes, accept the Fidelity
rules and use month-to-month changes to eliminate the penalty altogether</I>.
After a lot of historical back-testing we concluded that these funds have
a high degree of monthly -- not just daily -- persistency and the system
generates over 30% compounded annualized return with little downside risk.</P>

<P> Basically, our system, which we call STS (Select Timing Service), <I>generates
buy signals whenever a fund's price rises and the monthly change in price
is greater than F * average monthly change for that fund. The multiplier
F is a key factor here.</I> It is a proprietary quantity and depends (among
other things) on the volatility of the fund in question and usually varies
between 1.0 and 2.0.</P>

<P> (We also looked into shorting funds since Fidelity Brokerage allows
shorting some of the Select funds. However, we found that the degree of
persistency is much less if you go short.)</P>

<P> Since such a signal can occur for any fund, the key to success here
is determining which fund to buy. Through testing, we have identified 12
funds (out of 35 Fidelity Select funds) that have a high enough (68% or
higher) persistency of trend.</P>

<P> Also, the chosen funds must have enough volatility to produce decent
returns. In other words, if a fund is very persistent but its average monthly
change is only 0.5% -- which is true of some funds -- then we're not interested.
We want funds that typically change more than 3% or 4% per month <I>and</I>
are persistent.</P>

<P> The funds that we have chosen are always ranked in a descending order
of persistency. Thus, if we get signals for two or more funds -- which
happens quite often -- we will go into the highest persistency-ranked fund.</P>

<P> Since markets are constantly evolving and changing personalities, we
re-compute both the trigger points and validity of persistency for all
funds daily. If a fund's persistency goes below the 68% limit, the fund
is no longer considered a candidate. Likewise, an outside fund can jump
into the candidates' list because it has become more persistent.</P>

<P> In a sense, the STS strategy is similar to a card-counting strategy
employed by blackjack players in casinos. They wait until the deck of cards
becomes ten-heavy before they start betting. By doing that, they greatly
increase their chances of getting a ten. Likewise, we increase our chance
of success by investing only in funds that have demonstrated in the near
past a high probability of staying with the trend.</P>

<P> 
<HR><DFN>Risk Factors: </DFN><I>Investing in mutual funds is speculative
and involves a high degree of risk. The STS system has not been applied
over a significant period of time in real trading. Recommendations made
in the future may or may not equal or better the performance of STS as
simulated by historical back-testing. Even in a generally rising market,
STS may not outperform the market or may not result in any profits at all
to investors following its recommendations. Past actual or simulated performance
is no guarantee of future results.</I></P>

<P> <A NAME="backtesting"></A></P>

<H1>Back-testing Results</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=540></P>

<P> STS has shown good promise with the extensive computerized backtesting
we put it through. It yields about 600% total return over 6.5 years. (That's
equivalent to about 34% average annualized return compounded yearly.) The
backtesting accounted for early withdrawal penalties and margin interest
(if any). <A NAME="mechanix"></A></P>

<H1>STS Investment Mechanics</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=540></P>

<P> The mechanics of this investment system are straightforward. You would
invest a fixed amount of money, say, $10,000, all into the recommended
fund. Approximately one month from now, you will receive another recommendation.
If the fund you hold now is different from the one recommended, you replace
it with the newly recommended fund.</P>

<P>We have done a good deal of research attempting to figure out the <B>best
time of day to switch</B> funds. Click <A HREF="trademan.sht">here</A>
to find out about our <A HREF="trademan.sht">trade management</A> conclusions
which we believe enhances the STS returns. If you miss a signal by more
than a few days, we suggest you sell the current fund and stay in cash
until the following signal to synchronize with our signals.</P>

<P> (By the way, for diversification's sake, we have considered buying
two or more different Select funds. Our historical backtesting, however,
suggests staying in just one fund at a time. All a multi-fund strategy
gets us is a drop in overall return on equity without a significant reduction
in downside volatility -- which is low to begin with.)</P>

<P> If you're new to <A HREF="http://www.fid-inv.com">Fidelity</A> mutual
funds, please keep in mind that they charge a 3% up-front load for any
Fidelity Select fund. This may seem steep, but it's actually not a bad
deal because, unlike many other funds out there, there are no other charges
after that (except for a $7.50 fee for each redemption and exchange) and
Fidelity always remembers that you paid this load.</P>

<P> Like most fund families, Fidelity does not like switchers and will
charge you 0.75% of the assets for a short-term (less than 30 days) redemption.
However, the STS system was designed to avoid this charge by holding a
fund just over 30 days.</P>

<P> There is one exception. As a safeguard, we use stop losses. If our
chosen fund starts dropping -- it can happen; after all, this is a game
of probabilities -- we'll sell it if it loses N percent or more from the
purchase price, even if it means getting hit with the 0.75% short-redemption
penalty. Thus, you may get a new signal from us even if the month has not
passed. (We concluded from our historical backtesting that N should be
between 5% and 8%, but is dependent on the fund's volatility.)</P>

<P> <A NAME="costs"></A></P>

<H1>STS Costs</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=540></P>

<P> The trial is <I>free and without any obligations</I>.</P>

<P> After the trial we will send you signals without you having to pay
us in advance. You will be billed <B><I>only if the signal sent was profitable.
</I></B>Signals are sent at intervals of at least 30 days.</P>

<P> We have two payment plans: per-signal and annual.</P>

<P> In the <I>per-signal</I> plan the bill will be for $20 per profitable
signal. Since we assume you made money based on our signal, we feel $20
is most reasonable.</P>

<P> If the signal was not profitable, you will not get a bill and will
continue to get further signals. If it was profitable and you don't pay
the bill, then we will take you off the subscribers list and you will not
get subsequent signals.</P>

<P> The <I>annual</I> plan costs $150 per year. (The STS system has about
a 80% expectation of success. Therefore, since subscribers pay only for
successful signals, it is expected that on the average there would be 9.6
profitable signals per year, which is $192. Thus, to make the prepayment
more attractive, we are offering it for $150 per year.)</P>

<P> <I>We reserve the right to change these rates at any time. Subscribers
will be given 2 months notice of upcoming changes. </I></P>

<H4>Definition of Profitability</H4>

<P>Profitability is the fund's return for the holding period. Distributions,
if any, during the holding period also count. </P>

<P>If the fund's return plus distributions, if any, is greater than the
return from a money market account, we consider the signal to be profitable.</P>

<P> If our signal suggests going into cash, then we define the signal to
be profitable if the money market return generated from the cash is greater
than the return of the S&amp;P 500 index during the period we stay in cash.
(Dividends from the S&amp;P 500 stocks are excluded from the S&amp;P 500
return.)</P>

<P> If the cash signal was profitable and we stayed in cash a month, you
will receive a bill together with the next signal. If we stayed in cash
less than a month and then go into a fund, you will receive a time-prorated
bill for the cash portion in the next regular bill.</P>

<P> <I>Good luck. Persistency pays!</I></P>

<A name="dettop"></a>
<h1>Mini-rally Rule</h1>        
<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>

We hold a fund for 30 days that Fidelity requires
to hold a Select fund without incurring a 0.75%-of-assets penalty.
On the 30th day it is time to switch 
<i>unless</i> that fund is up more than its average daily change 
from the previous day <i>and</i> the position
currently has about a 2.5% gain (it depends on the volatility
of the fund) as compared to the buy price. The next day, the 
same rule applies.
<p>

This simple rule -- we call it a <b>mini-rally</b> rule -- has a rather 
significant contribution to the overall performance: if, for example, 
the total return after 6 years of backtesting is 600%, adding this 
rule makes it about 700%.
<p>

Due to this rule we don't know for certain when we are going to 
switch. (There have been times when the rule kept us holding a fund 
for an extra week.)

This chart plots the return relative to the return on the
first day of every year. <i>(It starts out at zero at the beginning of every year and 
that is why it looks so jagged.)</i><p>

It is a good way to see how the system performed every year without the
cumulative influence of previous years.<p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Trade Management</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------" HEIGHT=4 WIDTH=540></P>

<P>Unlike any other mutual funds, Fidelity Selects are priced hourly starting
at 10 am EST and ending at 4 pm EST. Whenever you place a trade it will
be executed at the next pricing. If you place a trade after the markets
close or at any time before 10 am the next day, the trade will be executed
at the 10 am prices. If you want the trade to be executed at the closing
prices then you should call Fidelity between 3 pm and 4 pm. </P>

<P>Being able to trade on the hour allows a <B>trade management strategy</B>
which, if applied on a consistent basis, enhances the STS returns. </P>

<P>This strategy is suitable for investors who can follow the markets between
9:30 am and 10 am (or at the very least for investors who can make one
phone call to Fidelity during that half-hour to gauge the markets). If
your schedule does not permit this, then you should probably place the
trades the night before and they will be filled at the opening hour (10
am). </P>

<P>We have looked into the intraday behavior of the Selects for the last
five years. The most apparent pattern is that Selects tend to have their
extremes at either the opening (10 am) or the closing (4 pm) time. More
than any other hour, the highs and lows of the day occur either at the
opening or at the close. </P>

<P>Since the Selects are correlated to the general market, <I>statistically
speaking</I>, a Select fund will have its daily low at the opening and
its daily high at the close if the markets are strongly up that day. Conversely,
<I>statistically speaking</I>, a fund will open at its daily high and close
at its daily low if the markets are strongly down that day. </P>

<P>The markets open at 9:30 am and any trade placed before 10 am will be
filled at the 10 am price. Knowing the above statistical behavior of funds,
this extra &quot;free&quot; half-hour allows us to do some intelligent
&quot;trade management.&quot; </P>

<P>If you follow STS, there are three possible ways to trade: </P>

<UL>
<LI>from cash into a fund </LI>

<LI>from a fund into cash </LI>

<LI>from a fund into a fund </LI>
</UL>

<P>Here is how we try to trade each case. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Cash to fund </LI>

<UL>
<LI>If the markets are strongly up between 9:30 am and 10 am (Dow-Jones
up over 30 points, for example), then it is best to buy the fund at the
10 am pricing because it is likely to close at or near its daily high.
</LI>

<LI>If the markets are strongly down, it is better to wait and buy the
fund at the close because it is likely to close at or near its daily low.
</LI>

<LI>If the markets are hard to read, then it is probably best to buy the
fund at the 10 am pricing to get it over with. </LI>
</UL>

<LI>Fund to cash </LI>

<UL>
<LI>If the markets are strongly up between 9:30 am and 10 am then it is
best to wait and sell the fund at the 4 pm pricing because it is likely
to close at or near its daily high. </LI>

<LI>If the markets are strongly down, it is better sell the fund at the
10 am pricing because it is likely to close at or near its daily low. </LI>

<LI>If the markets are hard to read, then it is probably best to sell the
fund at the 10 am pricing to get it over with. </LI>
</UL>

<LI>Fund to fund. </LI>

<UL>
<LI>If the markets are strongly up between 9:30 am and 10 am then it does
not matter when you switch because it is likely that both funds will be
rising as the trading day goes on. So it is probably best to switch funds
at the 10 am pricing just to get it over with. (Or, based on some information
beside STS, <I>you</I> may decide to wait until the close.) </LI>

<LI>If the markets are strongly down, it is better (i) to sell the fund
you currently own at the 10 am pricing (because it is likely to be at or
near its daily high at that time), (ii) wait until the close, and then
(iii) buy the new fund at the close (because it is likely to close at or
near its daily low). </LI>

<LI>If the markets are hard to read, then it is probably best to switch
funds at the 10 am pricing just to get it over with. </LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>The more recent trades shown at our <A HREF="http://www.dollarlink.com/record.sht">real-time
trading record at the STS Web site</A> have either opening or closing prices.
That is because we have been applying this trade management strategy.
</P>

<P><I>Please note that the strategy is based on statistical data and does
not work every time.</I> Sometimes what looked like a strong bull market
at 9:50 am may turn into a strong bear market by 4 pm. Markets are notoriously
fickle, especially intraday. However, the strategy should pay off if applied
consistently over the long run. </P>

                      Commentary   (Friday 03/01/96)
            ---------------------------------------------------

Not a good week for the markets.  Talk of inflation and budget deficits
spooked traders and stocks lost about 2% for the week.  On Friday, the
markets recovered -- based in part on some economic reports -- and had a
strong positive finish.  Except for technology stocks which got killed
following Compaq's disappointing earnings report.  We are beginning to see
a divergence between the general market and technology, which is a pity
because technology fueled most of last year's rally and is capable of doing
it again this year.

We have changes this week in the 8-fund portfolio (replace Fidelity New
Market Income with Fidelity Select Chemical) and in the 4-Selects-only
portfolio (replace Energy with Defense/Aerospace).

(*) The decision-making rules in DollarWin (technical analysis,
statistical, pattern recognition, etc.) are assigned a numerical value. 
Relative Strength Score (RSS) is a product of all these values.  The higher
the score, the better.  All the funds in the universe are ranked according
to this score.  "Risk" is a measure of recent (about 120 days) volatility
for each fund.  It usually varies between 1 and 30.  For mutual funds,
anything over 15 is considered very volatile.

            ---------------------------------------------------
                       Concepts Behind DollarWin
            ---------------------------------------------------


DollarWin is a quantitative, momentum-based stock/fund picking
computer system built on the premise that

       STOCKS/FUNDS THAT RISE IN PRICE MUCH FASTER THAN THE REST OF 
       THE MARKET CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE MARKET FOR SOME TIME.

For purposes of this newsletter, the DollarWin system focuses exclusively
on mutual funds, although it has been successfully applied to stocks.

DollarWin measures price trends for hundreds of mutual funds and then ranks
these mutual funds relative to each other using the price trend as a
measure of relative strength or weakness.

We have researched and fine-tuned the parameters that comprise the core of
DollarWin for many years.  The algorithms in DollarWin use various
technical analysis tools (such as moving averages, oscillators, MACD, On
Balance Volume, Money Flow, Fibonacci Numbers), statistical tools (such as
standard deviations, volatility measures and bands, chaos theory), as well
as proprietary pattern recognition decision-making rules.

In effect, DollarWin performs technical analysis on hundreds of price
charts SIMULTANEOUSLY in order to identify mutual funds that meet or exceed
the criteria for price performance.

Initially, DollarWin ranks all mutual funds in a specific universe (for
example, Fidelity FundsNetwork or Schwab's OneSource) and "buys" the top,
say, 4 mutual funds.  Every day thereafter, DollarWin continues to rank all
the mutual funds in the universe.  If a mutual fund has fallen out of the
top 4 based on our proprietary sell criteria, it is replaced by another
that has come up and meets the buy criteria.  If there are no suitable
replacement candidates, DollarWin "sells" and keeps the proceeds in cash. 
The next week, the procedure is repeated to see if a new candidate has
appeared.  The aim is always to be as fully invested as possible.  However,
it is possible, especially in a declining market, that DollarLink will stay
in cash because there may be no funds that meet DollarLink's rather
stringent acceptance criteria.

Keep in mind that this is a momentum-type system and it needs to "see" a
trend before it can make a decision.  Thus, it will never buy in early or
sell out early.  It will always be a bit late.  However, the
high-performing funds have quite a bit of inertia and will continue in the
same general direction for some time.  

Of course, since the system depends on analyzing trends, it cannot react
to short-term unpredictable events -- such as a sudden crash.  We have a
"stop-loss" rule designed for a fund that is sinking rapidly: if a fund is
down more than N percent from the highest high while we owned it, sell.  N
is typically about 6% to 8%; it depends on the volatility of the fund.

We have performed extensive computer simulations with the DollarWin system
to substitute for a long-term "track record." It has been tested on various
stock and mutual funds universes with up to 10 years of historical data. 
The historical back-testing has been as realistic as possible.  It includes
the cost of commissions as well as the effect of bid and ask spreads.  For
mutual funds it includes the cost of switching funds due to loads and
switching penalties.

Based on historical computer simulations, DollarWin delivers good total
returns.  For the universe of mutual funds comprised of Fidelity
FundsNetwork plus Fidelity Selects, DollarWin achieved about 200% since
1/1/91.

Although not available through this newsletter, DollarWin also achieved
excellent simulated results in its stock portfolios.  For a conservative
stock universe (such as the S&P 100 stocks), it achieved 1,400% total
return over a period of 10 years.  For a riskier universe comprised of high
technology stocks, it gave about 600% over a period of 5 years.  These
returns were achieved assuming a 5-stock portfolio strategy.

            ---------------------------------------------------
                      How To Use This Report
            ---------------------------------------------------

We, the editors of this report, use the DollarWin system every day to trade
our own accounts of stocks and mutual funds.  We also provide daily trading
advice to a sister investment company that manages money directly for its
clients.

This Signal Report uses the DollarWin system every week to rank a carefully
selected universe of mutual funds.  It then makes buy, sell or hold
recommendations.

There are over 5,000 publicly traded mutual funds in the U.S.  Rather than
trying to rank all of them -- an enormous and not necessarily more
rewarding job -- DollarWin concentrates on a smaller group of time-proven
mutual funds families.  The universe of mutual funds we have chosen --
about 350 funds -- is comprised of all the no-transaction-cost funds in the
Fidelity FundsNetwork, all the Fidelity Select Portfolios funds and the
Rydex funds.

Fidelity FundsNetwork is an association of 10 mutual fund families.  All
transactions are conducted through Fidelity Brokerage Services at no cost
to the client.  Fidelity Brokerage acts as a custodian for all your fund
positions and it is a convenient mechanism to switch mutual funds between
Fidelity as well as the other funds families.  For further information,
call Fidelity at 800-544-9697.  By using the FundsNetwork you eliminate the
inconveniences of dealing with several fund families, all at no cost to
you.

Fidelity Select funds have a 3% up-front load.  However, there is no fee to
switch between Select funds once you have bought one.  We include the
Selects in our universe because they have demonstrated a superior
performance over the years IF they are monitored closely.

Please note that DollarLink Software is not associated in any way (except
as a customer) with Fidelity Investments, Fidelity Brokerage or the
FundsNetwork.  We get absolutely no remuneration from Fidelity.  We use
Fidelity because it is a convenient mechanism for switching funds.

The concept of funds network was popularized by Charles Schwab Brokerage
(800-266-5623) and Jack White Brokerage (800-323-3263).  We have
back-tested DollarWin on both Schwab's and White's universes, but decided
to use Fidelity's FundNetwork because we have found its funds to be more
profitable in the long run.  The big difference is Fidelity itself: neither
Schwab nor White have Fidelity funds in their universes, and Fidelity
funds, especially the Selects, are usually near the top of all funds.

[In the spring of 1994 Muriel Siebert and Waterhouse Securities have also
started their own mutual funds networks, but they are not as comprehensive
as Schwab, White or Fidelity.]

The Rydex Funds are not in the FundsNetwork but we include them because one
of them, Ursa (RYURX), can act as a hedge against a bear market.  Ursa is
designed to be the opposite of the S&P 500 index.  Another, Nova (RYNVX) is
designed to copy the S&P.  Rydex funds have to loads nor switch penalties. 
You can buy them directly from Rydex (800-820-0888) or, if you're willing
to pay a small commission, through Jack White or Fidelity.

We have set up four aggressive model mutual fund porfolios classified by
the number of funds in the portfolio and by the type of funds in the
portfolio.  The Two-Fund portfolio usually gives the highest returns but is
the most volatile.  (We have found the Two-Fund portfolio to have less risk
and about the same returns as a one-fund portfolio.) The Four-Fund
portfolio is usually more diversified and less risky but also gives lower
returns.  The 4-Fund Selects-only portfolio chooses funds only from the
Fidelity Select sector funds.  It is about as risky as the regular
four-fund portfolio.  The Eight-Fund portfolio is the least risky.

The more funds in a portfolio, the less risk but also the lower the
potential return.  Since we are guided by performance strength,
diversification is not a specific DollarWin goal, although it is certainly
an important consideration in the selection process.  Keep in mind that
since we are going after maximum returns, the funds that we select are very
likely to underperform the general market during a decline, but should also
outperform the market during a rise.

Our model portfolios assume $20,000 starting capital for the Two-Fund
portfolio, $40,000 for the Four-Fund portfolio and the 4-Fund Selects
portfolio, and $80,000 for the Eight-Fund portfolio.  You can follow the
DollarWin system with any amount of money; our assumed starting capital is
a convenient starting point.

Our asset allocation strategy is simple: starting capital is split in equal
shares for all funds.  Thus, in the Four-Fund portfolio, you would allocate
$10,000 for each fund.

Each week DollarWin may recommend a buy or sell signal.  If you don't
already own the funds recommended by DollarWin, after you receive the
DollarWin report, you should place the trade during the next trading
session before the close.  It will be executed at the close of that
session.

In the case of Fidelity Select funds, their trades can be executed sooner
than the close: every hour on the hour during trading.  However, through
experience, we have not found that to be advantageous and we trade at the
closing prices.

If you are just getting started, decide which model portfolio you are going
to follow and start synchronizing yourself to the model portfolio by buying
the recommended "buy" funds for that portfolio.  Do not buy the funds in
the portfolio that we classify as "hold" and wait until we either sell them
or reclassify as a "buy."

If you have been following the system and are currently holding a partially
filled portfolio, wait until there is a "buy" on a fund that is not in your
current portfolio.

The DollarWin reports do not account for the cost of loads and switching
(if any).  On the other hand, we also exclude the interest that the account
may earn while not fully invested, as well as all dividends.

Based on historical back-testing, our optimized buy/sell criteria generates
a switch for a position roughly every 38 calendar days, on average.  Such
frequent switching may trigger switching penalties.  For example, the
Fidelity Select funds charge 0.75% of assets if you hold a fund less than
30 days.  Some other Fidelity funds will charge 1.5% to switch if you hold
a fund less than 90 days.  For other fund families, the switching penalties
vary; some are more forgiving than others, but in general they are similar
to Fidelity.

In our extensive back-testing we assumed a conservative and uniform 2%
switching penalty EVERY TIME we sold a fund.  DollarWin still produced very
impressive returns.  Our research has convinced us that properly timed
switching is a much more important consideration than the cost of
switching.










            ---------------------------------------------------
                             Risk Factors
            ---------------------------------------------------

Investing in mutual funds is speculative and involves a high degree of
risk.  The DollarWin system has not been applied over a significant period
of time in real trading.  Recommendations made in the future may or may not
equal or better the performance of DollarWin as simulated by historical
back-testing.  Because the DollarWin system is intended to identify stocks
or mutual funds whose price is increasing, it may not perform as
anticipated in a flat or generally declining market.  Even in a generally
rising market, DollarWin may not outperform the market or may not result in
any profits at all to investors following its recommendations.  Past actual
or simulated performance is no guarantee of future results.

<H3>Correlation Analysis </H3>

<P>It is often quite useful to be able to correlate two different markets.
For example, a technical analyst may want to know the correlation between
stocks A and B. If the correlation, say, is very strong and stock A just
had a significant gain, the analyst may then want to buy stock B because
it is likely that B will also go up. </P>

<P>Another application might be to find the correlation between two different
commodities. </P>

<P>Yet another application might be to correlate a market index (such as
the $SPX) with a particular stock. Thus if a stock shows to have a, say,
85% correlation to the $SPX, one could then have a good feel as to the
future behavior of that stock based on a knowledge of the $SPX. </P>

<P>An economist, <B>Harry Markowitz</B>, has developed a whole investment
discipline called <B>Modern Portfolio Theory</B> where the knowledge of
the correlation between different stocks is used very effectively. The
idea there is to create a portfolio of several relatively strong stocks
that are weakly correlated. If some stocks go down, then the other stocks
will not because they have shown to have independent behavior in the past.
Thus, by properly selecting, it is possible to reduce the risk for the
total portfolio. Markowitz was awarded the Nobel prize in economics for
his work in this area. </P>

<P>To compute the correlation between two different stocks we use the tools
from regression analysis. We plot the price data of stock A on one axis
versus the price data of stock B on the other axis. We then perform a regression
analysis on the chart, i.e., draw a straight line between the points on
the chart such that the difference between the line and all the points
on the chart is minimal. </P>

<P>The slope of that line -- called correlation coefficient or R -- determines
how well (or poorly) the two stocks are correlated. If the correlation
coefficient is 1.0 then the stocks are perfectly correlated. For example,
if you plot a stock versus itself, then its R = 1.0 and it is said to be
perfectly correlated with itself. If the stocks have an R = -1.0 then the
stocks are perfectly uncorrelated, i.e., they behave opposite from each
other. </P>

<P>Correlations are somewhere between those two extremes of +1.0 and -1.0,
but for trading instruments such as stocks or commodities anything over
0.0, say, 0.3 or 0.4 is considered to be a pretty strong correlation. </P>

<P>One interesting way to use correlation analysis is to determine if a
stock has persistency of trend . As noted above, if you plot a stock's
price data on both the horizontal and vertical axes, you will get an R
= 1.0. However, if you plot on one of the axes the data shifted by one
element in the series , you can then compute what is then called an autocorrelation
coefficient for the stock. </P>

<P>In other words, you are plotting </P>

<PRE>             Y<SUB>i</SUB>      versus   Y<SUB>i-1 
</SUB>                             
</PRE>

<P>where i is the i-th element of the price history set and i-1 is the
previous element of the price history set. </P>

<P>This autocorrelation coefficient indicates the degree of trendiness
in the price data for that stock. The greater the coefficient, the more
persistency of trend is exhibited by the historical price data, and therefore,
the trend should be more reliable in the future. </P>

<P>For example, if you take daily $SPX prices for the past 7 years and
plot them against themselves but with the data delayed one day on one of
the axes, you will then come up with the autocorrelation coefficient of
about 0.1, which indicates a mild persistency of an upward trend. </P>

<P><B>How to Use in DollarLink? </B></P>

<P>We have implemented this correlation analysis into DollarLink in a simple-to-use
way. Suppose you want to know the correlation between a stock that's plotted
in window 1 and a stock in some other window. </P>

<P>All you have to do is make window 1 the active window and press 6. DollarLink
will ask you which window you want to compare window 1. Enter the number
of any other window and DollarLink will instantly compute and display the
correlation coefficient R. If you enter 1 as the window to compare, DollarLink
will then compute the autocorrelation coefficient. </P>

<P>Usually correlation analysis is done for data that uses the same time
frame, i.e., daily versus daily, or tick-by-tick versus tick-by-tick. In
our implementation, however, you can mix apples and oranges and compute,
for example, the correlation coefficient of $SPX between its 15-minute
bar chart data and its 5-minute bar chart data. Or, say, the correlation
of 5-minute S&amp;P futures data and 30-minute bond futures data. It's
up to you. Of course, the interpretation of the resulting correlation coefficient
is also up to you. </P>

<P>As in all statistical analysis, the more data you have in your charts
data the more valid the results. </P>

<h2> 
Enhancements Added
</h2> 

<h3> 
Dow-Jones Industrials over 6553
</h3> 

Ten years ago, when DollarLink was first being designed, we were able 
to fit quote prices into two bytes rather than the customary four 
its takes to fit a floating point number. We took advantage of the 
fact that prices are usually below 1600. This allowed us to add many 
advanced features into DollarLink and fit it all into conventional 
RAM of the PC.
<p>

The exception was Dow-Jones Industrials ($INDU) which was already 
over 1600 then.  Special handling was programmed into DollarLink to 
be able to process $INDU (and $DJ) and still fit its prices into two-byte 
numbers. This special handling works only if the incoming price number 
is less than 6553.  Ten years ago that seemed like science fiction, 
but today we are seeing these numbers.
<p>

In order to be able to process numbers higher than 6553 correctly, 
we have now modified DollarLink's special treatment of $INDU and $DJ.  The 
original approach still works, but DollarLink now subtracts a user-input 
number (called  offset ) from an incoming $INDU and $DJ price 
and then stores the result as a two-byte number.  To use this stored 
number, the two-byte number is converted back into a floating point 
number and the offset is added.
<p>

The file called ACCURATE contains the offset to use. It is a small 
text file and you can modify it with any text editor or word processor. 
DollarLink reads this file at startup. If it finds 2 lines of the 
form
<p>

<pre>
INDU,3000 
DJ,3000
</pre>
<p>

then it processes the $INDU and $DJ numbers in the new manner. If 
it does not find such a line, it processes the $INDU and $DJ numbers 
without offsetting the internal numbers.
<p>


We supply this ACCURATE file with the updates.
<p>


After you upgrade, one step remains. The upgrade will affect all historical 
charts of $INDU and $DJ.  All the $INDU and $DJ prices that were stored 
prior to this new way of storing did not have the offset number subtracted 
from them. All old prices will appear too big (by the offset amount).
<p>


To correct the historical data for $INDU and $DJ we have written a 
special utility call DJADJUST.  To use after you upgrade, from the 
DollarLink directory execute
<p>


<pre>
DJADJUST date1 date2 [enter]
</pre>
<p>


where date1 is the starting date (inclusive) and date2 is the ending 
date (inclusive) of the data to be adjusted.
<p>


To adjust all data enter
<p>


<pre>
DJADJUST  0  0 [enter]
</pre>
<p>


To adjust all data prior to, say, 12/1/96, enter
<p>


<pre>
DJADJUST  0   12-1-96
</pre>
<p>


In this example, DJADJUST will go through all your historical files 
up to and not including data on 12-1-96 and save the $INDU and $DJ 
data in the new way. It will retain the original files with the same 
name, except for the last letter which is replaced by  B , 
e.g.,  
07-07-94.CLS will be the new modified file and the original is still 
there but called 07-07-94.CLB.
<p>


Since DJADJUST does a careful check of the data files, allow plenty 
of time (a few hours) for DJADJUST to complete its work. Also, make 
sure you have plenty of free space on your hard disk. DJADJUST will 
check hard disk availability before proceeding.
<p>


After a few days of verification, you should delete all these historical 
files that end with a  B  from the disk because they take 
up room. To do that, from the DollarLink directory execute the following 
5 commands:
<p>


<pre>
del cls\*.clb [enter] 
del 05m\*.05b [enter] 
del 15m\*.15b [enter] 
del 30m\*.30b [enter] 
del 60m\*.60b [enter]
</pre>
<p>


Back up your historical data before running DJADJUST. Simply copy 
all your historical data to some temporary directory on your hard 
disk. We have included a batch file that you can use to back up all 
historical data to a directory called  TMPDATA . To use it, from 
the DollarLink directory execute the command
<p>


<pre>
BACKDATA  TMPDATA [enter]
</pre>
<p>


Again, after a few days of verification, you can delete all these 
back-up files with the command
<p>


<pre>
del \TMPDATA [enter]
</pre>
<p>


The PC will ask you  Are you sure?  Say  yes. 
<p>


To modify the Dow-Jones, you can request an update from us. All updates 
are free to  currently active  customers.

<p>

Active customers include all renters, all those on a six-month lease, 
all purchasers within the last 12 months, or purchasers who have paid 
the $300 support fee within the last 12 months. Contact us if you 
wish to check or change your status.

Enhancements Added
</h2> 

<h3> 
Customized Dow-Jones Window
</h3> 

There is a small window on DollarLink's screen that is currently reserved 
for quotes for the Dow-Jones Industrials. In text mode this window 
is in the upper right hand corner; in graphics it is in the center 
of the bottom of the screen. The window shows the latest price, change 
and total volume for the NYSE. This window appears on every text and 
graphics page you switch to.
<p>

If you are not interested in Dow-Jones but would like to follow some 
other symbol in a similar fashion, then you can now tell DollarLink 
to put that symbol into that window. For example, commodity traders 
don't particularly care about Dow-Jones but would like to see a favorite 
commodity instead.
<p>

While in text mode, press  C,S,D (Control, Setup, Dow-Jones ) 
and DollarLink will prompt you for the symbol to put into that window. 
That symbol must be in your active DollarLink portfolio. It can be 
a regular symbol (i.e., index, commodity, option or stock) or a custom 
index or a chartlink.
<p>

<h2> 
New Web Site and E-Mail Address
</h2> 

We now have a new domain name on the Internet. The new Web site address 
for DollarLink is
<p>

<pre>
<a href="http://www.dollarlink.com/dlink.htm">http://www.dollarlink.com/dlink.htm</a>
</pre>
<p>

and the new E-mail address is   
<p>
<pre>
<a href="mailto:support@dollarlink.com">support@dollarlink.com</a>
</pre>
<p>

The old Web and E-mail addresses (<b>http://www.creative.net/~dollar</b>
and <b>dollar@creative.net</b>) will still work fine for a long 
time, but may eventually go away.)
<p>

<h2> 
Quotes via the Internet
</h2> 

There are numerous sites on the Web that provide some sort of stock
quotes. Most of them allow you to obtain one quote of the time (sort of
like calling your broker for a quote), but not too many provide
continuous  quotes. Among those with continuous quotes, most have
delayed quotes but some vendors provide real time quotes.
<p>

Both DBC and PC Quote are right in there. They both offer real-time 
and delayed quotes using both the Web and their own Internet-based 
software that bypasses the Web for speed reasons. We are not 
aware of any application software that can use these services.
<p>

<h4> 
Hidden Cost
</h4> 

Although using the Internet as a transmission medium rather than their 
own proprietary datafeed network allows a data vendor to offer both 
real-time and delayed quotes at a significantly lower cost, there 
is a  hidden cost  that should be considered.
<p>

Most individual investors connect to the Web or Internet via a telephone 
connection. Phone companies and Internet Service Providers don't 
like it if you are going to be connected for six or eight hours at 
a time. (Many Internet Service Providers offer an unmetered connection 
for a typical price of $20/month. However, in their language,  unmetered  
usually does not mean  unlimited. ) They will let you do it 
but usually it will cost you more because you have to have a dedicated 
Internet account (here on the very-competitive West coast the typical 
cost is about $75 to $100 per month) and a dedicated phone line (another 
$15 to $50 per month). All of a sudden your $49.95/month Internet-based 
real-time quote feed is right up there costing just as much as the 
traditional FM/satellite/cable delivery system. 
<p>

Keep this in mind next time you're surfing the Web and are lured by 
all those low-cost datafeed ads.
<p>

<h3> 
Up to 20 Terms In Custom Index
</h3> 

We have been able to increase the maximum number of terms in a custom 
index from 10 to 20.  This should reduce the number of custom indices 
that are needed to compute a formula that may have more than 10 terms.  The 
previous approach to compute an index with, say, 60 components was 
to create six custom indices, each with 10 terms, and then a seventh 
index that sums the first six indices.  Now you have to define only 
three custom indices and then a fourth one to sum the three indices.
<p>

<h4>
Example
</h4>

Suppose you wanted to add the current prices of 50 stocks. Since 
the maximum number of terms a custom index can evaluate is 20, you 
have to add up several custom indices together. 
<p>

There are two ways of doing this. 
<p>

The first is to break up the set of 50 stocks into sets of 20, 20 
and 10 stocks and then add the custom indices that evaluate each 
set.  The definition formulas would be
<p>

<pre> 
$$1 =  1.0 * S1 + 1.0 * S2 + ... + 1.0 * S20  
$$2 =  1.0 * S21 + 1.0 * S22 + ... + 1.0 * S40  
$$3 =  1.0 * S41 + 1.0 * S42 + ... + 1.0 * S50  
$$4 =  1.0 * $$1 + 1.0 * $$2 + 1.0 * $$3
</pre> 
<p>

where S1, S2, ..., S50 are the various stocks you want to add up.
<p>

The other way  is to  chain  these stocks as follows:
<p>

<pre>  
$$C1 =  1.0 * S1 + 1.0 * S2 + ... + 1.0 * S20  
$$C2 =  1.0 * S21 + 1.0 * S22 + ... + 1.0 * S39 + 1.0 * $$C1 
$$C3 =  1.0 * S40 + 1.0 * S41 + ... + 1.0 * S50 + 1.0 * $$C2
</pre> 
<p>

In this example, the custom index $$C3 is equivalent to the above 
custom index $$4.
<p>

We call it  chaining  because custom index $$C1 is part of 
the custom index $$C2 and $$C2 is part of the index $$C3. They act 
as a link between indices.
<p>

There is no particular advantage of either approach and you should 
use whichever approach you find more confortable.
<p>

Remember that you have to worry about overflowing the numbers. 
In the examples here we used 1.0 as the coefficient for each term 
in the sums. It is possible that adding the prices of 20 stocks would 
result in a number greater than 1600. Therefore, it is probably better 
to use 0.001 in this example as the coefficient for each term and 
then to remember that the resulting sum is in thousands of dollars.
<p>

It has been a year since Windows 95 was introduced and we have been 
using it for several months to run DollarLink. 
<p>

Although we feel that it is always better to use DOS to run DollarLink, 
some of our customers find it convenient to multitask. Windows 95 
will do that better than Windows 3.1. Win 95 appears to be more stable 
than Win 3.1, but it still is not rock-solid.
<p>

DollarLink seems to run a bit faster in a DOS session under Win95 
than under Win 3.1. This is probably because of the 32-bit hard disk 
access that Win 95 provides its DOS sessions. However, DollarLink 
still runs faster in regular DOS outside of Win 95.

It is easier to run DollarLink in a DOS session under Windows 95 than 
Windows 3.1.  All you have to do is find the MS-DOS icon on the desktop 
(or with the file manager program called Explorer that comes with 
Win 95) and click on it.  That will open up a DOS screen with a C 
prompt.  That screen may occupy either a portion of the PC screen 
or the full screen.  (You can toggle that setting with Alt+ENTER key 
combination.) We prefer letting DollarLink take up the entire PC screen.
<p>

Unlike Win 3.1, you don't have to create a .pif file.  To put DollarLink 
into the background so that it continues to run, use the Alt+Tab 
key combination to rotate between different applications that are 
active.
<p>

Beware that before you put DollarLink into the background 
you should have DollarLink in the  text mode .  If you put it 
into the background while you are in graphics mode, Win 95 will suspend 
it and not process quotes until you put it into the foreground again.
<p>

If you are going to run DollarLink in a DOS session under  Win 95, 
start DollarLink with
<p>

<pre> 
$$  [enter]	
</pre> 
<p>

The double $$ command is just like the single $ command except that 
it does not try to reboot the PC at midnight. (It just goes back into 
DollarLink after midnight.) This is particularly useful if you want 
to run DollarLink continuously for more than 24 hours.

<h2> 
Enhancements Added
</h2>

<h3> 
1200 Maximum Symbols in Portfolio
</h3> 

By squeezing a few things here and there, we were able to extend the 
maximum number of symbols in a DollarLink portfolio from 1000 to 1200. 
It is set in Question 20, Part 1 of SETUP.
<p>

To use this option effectively, make sure that your PC has at least 
600K of the lower 640K of RAM free.  It is very important that the 
lower 640K (as opposed to the  extended  memory, which your 
PC may have in abundant amount) is as unoccupied as possible.  Your 
PC's memory manager program  --  EMM386.SYS or QEMM386.SYS, for example 
should be able to take care of that.
<p>

Also, if you are getting quotes on stock options and want to increase 
the number of symbols in the portfolio to 1200, make sure to tell 
DollarLink to load incoming option quotes into high memory (Question 
25, Part 1 of SETUP).  This will free up some of the lower 640K RAM.

Keep in mind that on the Signal datafeed the receivers can hold no 
more than 1200 symbols in the user portfolio. (The enhanced Signal 
receivers can also keep up to 64,000 quotes in a separate  instant 
quotes  database, but that's different from the  user  
database.)

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Bid/Ask Prices in Hot Quotes</h3>

Hot Quotes are the 10 little windows that appear at the bottom of 
the screen when you are in graphics mode. You can tell DollarLink 
to display any symbol in one of these hot quotes windows by pressing 
WH (Windows, Hot Quotes). Hot Quotes can be turned on or off by pressing 
the Home key while you are in graphics mode. Whenever the datafeed 
sends a quote for a symbol in a hot quote window, that information 
is updated in the hot quote.
<p>

If the information displayed is too long for the hot quote window, 
you can toggle between long and short display mode by pressing Alt+V 
keys. DollarLink will toggle between displaying the name and the hot 
quote window letter (followed by the price information).
<p>

Until now, the information displayed was the latest price and change 
from yesterday. <b>You can now display bid/ask price information instead 
of the last price/change information</b>. This should be useful for option 
traders as well as for short-term stock traders who use bid/ask information 
as part of their decision-making.
<p>

The Alt + V key combination will now rotate between 1) long names 
and price/change, 2) short names and price/change, 3) long names and 
bid/ask, and 4) short names and bid/ask. Just keep pressing the Alt 
+ V until the display shows what you need.
<p>

<h2>Vote For DollarLink!</h2>

<i>Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities</i> magazine has an 
annual Reader's Choice Awards survey. Readers of the magazine vote 
for the investment software and datafeeds they prefer. DollarLink 
has always scored highly in this survey, either winning or placing 
in its category.
<p>

This year, probably due to their sloppiness, DollarLink's name is 
missing on the voting ballot. The ballot went out to magazine subscribers 
early this month. What is odd is that DollarLink is listed in the 
<i>Portfolio Management</i> and <i>Options Analysis</i> categories, 
but not in its bread-and-butter <i>Real-Time Technical Analysis</i>
category.
<p>

If you subscribe to this magazine, please fill out the ballot and 
write in DollarLink in the <i>Professional Platform</i> category 
(that's where DollarLink was listed last year and where it won honorable 
mention), as well as in the  <i>Software &gt;  $500</i> category.
<p>

Please help us correct this (unintentional, we are told) oversight 
by  <i>Stocks & Commodities</i>. Thank you. 
<p>

<h2>Labor Day Holiday</h2>

DollarLink Software will be closed on Labor Day, Monday, September 
2, 1996.

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Historic Price Adjustments by Addition/Subtraction</h3>

DollarLink has a split feature to adjust historical prices whenever 
a stock splits. To use it, place the cursor over the symbol you want 
to adjust (while in text mode) and press Del, and then 5. 
<p>

Until now, DollarLink would ask you to supply a multiplier factor 
and then it would go through all the historical prices for the specified 
stock and multiply each price by the factor. Thus, if the stock had 
a two-for-one split, the multiplier should be 0.5. 
<p>

It would also divide the volume of the stock by the multiplier to 
adjust the number of stock shares. Thus, if the multiplier is 0.5, 
dividing the volume by 0.5 means that now there will be twice as much 
stock.
<p>

Now DollarLink will ask you if you want to multiply the historical 
stocks by a factor or to add a factor to the prices. 
<p>

If you choose the add-factor, then you will be asked to supply a number. 
This number, which can be negative, will then be added to all the 
historical prices of the stock in question.
<p>

Unlike the multiplier choice, the historical volumes are not adjusted.
<p>

This enhancement is useful to adjust prices of stocks or mutual funds 
whenever there has been a dividend or a distribution. 
<p>

For stocks, the effect of a dividend is usually ignored and historical 
prices are usually not adjusted because dividends are usually a small 
percentage of a stock's price.
<p>

Mutual funds, however, are different in that a distribution can be 
quite substantial (witness this year's May distribution of 
<a href="http://www.fid-inv.com">Fidelity</a> 
Magellan fund: about $10 on a $50 price/share) and should not be ignored. 
Thus, to properly adjust Magellan's historical prices after the distribution, 
you should subtract the $10 from all its historical prices. Therefore, 
the proper add-factor for DollarLink to use in this case would be 
-10.00.
<p>

<h2>PC Quote's Hyperfeed</h2>

DollarLink works with <a href="http://www.dbc.com">DBC-Signal</a>, 
BMI and <a href="http://www.pcquote.com">PC Quote</a> datafeeds. All 
of these datafeeds have transmission networks that operate at either 
9.6K baud or at 19.2K baud. DollarLink works with either speed.
<p>

In addition, recognizing the relentless increase in quotes traffic, 
PC Quote has a much faster transmission network, called Hyperfeed, 
that runs at 56K baud. 
<p>

DollarLink can now work with this Hyperfeed network. PC Quote engineers 
have developed new software communications drivers that -- transparent 
to DollarLink -- can handle the processing of quotes at 56K baud 
in the DOS environment that DollarLink requires.
<p>

This is good news for DollarLink customers. The dramatic increase 
in quotes traffic in the last few years has made timely delivery of 
quotes, and especially of stock option quotes, quite difficult for 
the datafeed vendors. All datafeed vendors are looking into ways -- 
preferably transparent to existing applications -- of increasing 
their quotes network speeds. Hyperfeed is the first in that direction.
<p>

Please note that to use Hyperfeed and DollarLink you will most likely 
require a new satellite dish antenna (PC Quote works over satellite 
antennas; they also have high-speed and very high speed T-1 phone 
lines) and the new software drivers from PC Quote.
<p>

If you currently are using DollarLink with either Signal or BMI datafeeds 
and would contemplate switching to PC Quote to use Hyperfeed, note 
that you will also need to get the PC Quote version of DollarLink. 
We charge $50 for the switch, available to active customers only.
<p>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>
 

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Different Sound for News</h3>

You can set alarms in DollarLink to trigger on price levels, study 
values or keywords that appear in incoming news stories or headlines.
<p>

In order to differentiate them better, the alarm sound is now different 
for alarms triggered on price levels and for alarms triggered on keywords 
in news stories.  The sound for alarms on stories keywords is higher 
pitched.
<p>

<h3>Significant Gaps</h3>

We have done some research on the effects of gaps on the price behavior 
of stocks. By a  gap  we mean a price jump between the close 
on one day and the open on the next day.
<p>

Most of the time stocks open at the same price that they closed the 
previous trading session (give or take 1/8th). However, on occasion, 
due to some news, rumors, earning reports, corporate developments, 
etc., stocks will open significantly higher or lower than the previous 
day's close.
<p>

Many people use gaps in a sort of a contrarian way: if, for example, 
a stock or commodity gaps up but then reverses itself later in the 
trading session and starts dropping and eventually  fills  
the gap, meaning that the price goes below the gap level, then this 
is a strong indication that the price is going to go further down. 
Therefore, many traders will either cover their long positions at 
this point or go short.
<p>

In our research  --  which was initiated by input from DollarLink 
customers  --  we have found (in about 70% of the stocks that we 
examined) that if the gap is significant enough, then the stock will 
have a substantial move in the same direction within about the next 
5 trading days.  (This does not conflict with the possibility of a 
stock reversing and filling the gap on that same day.  The filling-the-gap 
event is a short-term, one-day process.  The significant-gap event 
is a longer-term, several-days process.)
<p>

The definition of  significant enough  varies for different 
stocks.  In general it should be between 1 and 5 percent of the stock's 
price. Usually, more volatile stocks have a higher gap to jump before 
they  decide  to eventually head in that direction for good.
<p>

In our research we have concentrated on highly liquid stocks. The 
less-traded stocks appear to have more erratic behavior. The system 
can be applied for liquid commodities as well, but the results seem 
to be less reliable than for stocks (at least for the commodities 
that we looked at).
<p>

<h4>Significant Gap Lists in Link</h4>

We have added the ability to create Significant Gap lists. DollarLink 
will go through all issues in the active portfolio and look for issues 
that have formed a gap. To use, at any time of the trading day, press 
PG (Portfolio, Gaps).  Then press U (Update).  This tells DollarLink 
to go through all symbols in the portfolio and find symbols that have 
some kind of a gap.  DollarLink will ask you for a gap value to compare 
today's open price to the previous day's close for each issue in the 
active portfolio.  It can be either in units of price (e.g., 1.75) 
or in percents (e.g., 3.5%).
<p>

After that, DollarLink will ask you if you want to limit the gap list 
that it is going to compile to only portfolio stocks that meet this 
gap criterion.  (DollarLink normally creates a gap list for portfolio 
stocks that meet various gap criteria, Significant Gap being one of 
them. If you just want to see issues that meet this Significant Gap 
criterion, you should say  yes  to that question.)
<p>

After it has compiled the list, DollarLink asks you about its disposition. 
You can print it or save it to a file. 
<p>

If you save it to a file, the name of the file will be  MMDDYYnn.GAP , 
where nn is a sequence number between 00 and 99, and  MMDDYY  
is the current date. You can view the saved file while in DollarLink 
by pressing CDV (Control, DOS, View) choice from the basic text screen.  DollarLink 
will ask you for the name of the file to view and you will type its 
name in, e.g.,  06079602.GAP . You can then view file on the screen 
and scroll up or down within it.
<p>

<h2>4th of July Holiday</h2>

<h1>DollarLink News -- April 30, 1996</h1>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>
 

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Turn off/on news on the fly</h3>

Datafeeds are getting more and more saturated with the increased flow 
of quotes  --  especially prices on options. In order to facilitate 
processing of price quotes, you may want to turn off the processing 
of incoming news temporarily.  This is particularly handy when the 
markets experience waves of high trade activities: you may not want 
the news  --  especially the very detailed Dow Jones news  --  to 
clog up the computer.<p>

With that in mind, we added a toggle choice to turn incoming news 
on/off. To use, press N (for News) from the basic text screen and 
then O (for On/off).  When the processing is turned off, DollarLink 
will ignore (and not store) all incoming news headlines and stories 
until you turn it back on.<p>

<h3>Directional Logic Custom Index</h3>

At the request of our customers, we have added a custom index that 
returns +1.0 if the change field of the underlying stock/future/index 
is positive, -1.0 if the change field is negative, or 0.0 if it is 
unchanged.<p>

To create a custom index using this feature, pick choice L in the 
field  choice whenever you create the custom index. Choice 
L will then let you choose between a logical index on price or a logical 
index on change.<p>

<h3>Grain Prices</h3>

DollarLink uses a very compact data-storage procedure in order to 
minimize the amount of RAM needed. However, the procedure assumes 
that the prices will be within certain ranges.<p>

99% of the issues comply, but once in a while the numbers get too 
large.<p>

In the last month or so, Soy Beans have surged to their highest prices 
in nearly a decade. This has caused some numerical problems for DollarLink.<p>

We have implemented two possible solutions.  Use only one; they 
are mutually exclusive. <p>

<h4>Method 1. Divide by 10</h4>

About 18 months ago we implemented the ability for our customers to 
modify price magnitudes on their own. In the DollarLink directory 
there is a text file called DOWNSIZE.TBL which allows users to define 
which symbols should be divided by 10, 100 or 1000 before DollarLink 
will accept them.<p>

Thus, to adjust the Soy Beans (or another grain commodity),  add the 
following line to the bottom of the DOWNSIZE.TBL file:	<p>

<pre>
commodity:S ,10
</pre>
<p>

This tells DollarLink on startup to divide all incoming Soy Bean prices 
by 10. Thus, an incoming price of 823.50 will be stored and used as 
82.35. However, 823.75 will become 82.38, and 823.25 will be 82.33.<p>

(You will have to run our SPLIT utility to divide all historical data 
by 10, because after the above adjustment all numbers will be stored 
as one tenth of the actual prices.)<p>

<h4>Method 2. Subtract a chunk from the price</h4>

There is a text file called ACCURATE in the DollarLink directory that 
tells DollarLink how to handle prices for symbols that have large 
values AND still keep the decimal accuracy. <p>

This is done by going through a special treatment for selected symbols 
(such as $SPX, $OEX and IN X) where DollarLink subtracts a number 
(specified in the ACCURATE file) from the incoming price. Thus a large 
number becomes a  reasonable  after the subtraction operation. 
DollarLink then stores this smaller number without loss of accuracy. 
When it comes time for DollarLink to recall this number for display 
or charting or computations, it knows to add that same offset amount.<p>

We have now extended the ACCURATE file for the grain (wheat, corn, 
oats and soy beans) commodities.<p>

Just add between a text line to the bottom of the ACCURATE file. It 
should look similar to this:<p>

<pre>
S ,N
</pre>
<p>

<i>(Don't forget the space before the comma.)</i> <p>

This tells DollarLink to subtract N (where N is a number such as 500 
or 700) from the actual value for all the soy bean contracts. Thus, 
for example, if the incoming number is 832.25 and you set N to 700, 
then DollarLink subtracts 700 from 832.25 and stores 132.25 internally. 
Since 132.25 is a  reasonable  number, there is no loss of 
accuracy. When DollarLink needs that value back, it knows that it 
has to add 700 to 132.25 just before using that value.
<p>
N should be a positive number. Different grains can have different 
offsets. The idea is to  bring down  the internal value to 
below 165. Thus, if soy beans go crazy and climb to, say, the 1200 
range, a good N would be 1100.<p>

(Again, if you decide to use Method 2, you will have to run our SPLIT 
utility to adjust all historical data. You shouldn't change N too 
often because it affects historical data.)<p>

After you go through this subtraction process, you will have full 
accuracy  and  the numbers can be large.<p>

For Method 2, you need to order an update from us.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>End-Point Moving Average as a ChartLink</h3>

The End-Point Moving Average (EPMA) study that we added two months 
ago is now also available as a ChartLink.<p>

<h4>Here is a a brief review of the EPMA.</h4>

An End-Point Moving Average is based on linear regression 
analysis. A regression line is a statistical concept (see the November 
30, 1995 DollarLink newsletter). It is a straight line between a series 
of data points such that the sum of deviations of all data points 
from the line is the minimum. In technical analysis, the regression 
line typically represents a trend line that incorporates the effect 
of all price data. It is an effective tool because prices will tend 
to oscillate about the regression line.<p>

An EPMA is similar to an arithmetic moving average in the 
sense that it needs a set of datapoints (as opposed to an exponential 
MA which requires only the value of the current exponential MA and 
the new price value).<p>

Similar to the procedure for an arithmetic moving average, 
DollarLink calculates the definition of a regression line for a set 
of data.  Then it computes the value of the last (rightmost) point 
by using the equation of the line.  That becomes the first value of 
the EPMA.  Then DollarLink repeats the procedure for the set of data 
shifted to the right by one datapoint.  It continues in this fashion 
until it goes through all the data in the chart.<p>

For bar charts, an EPMA can be based on opens, highs, lows, 
or closes of a bar.  For intraday line charts, an EPMA is based on 
price data in a user-set number of minutes.<p>

To create an EPMA ChartLink, in text mode press P (Portfolio) and 
then L (chartLink). DollarLink will then ask you the usual ChartLink-related 
questions.<p>

<h3>Improvement to the Custom Text Layout</h3>

In addition to the default text screen layout, a DollarLink user can 
customize the various columns as he wishes.  This is a convenient 
feature because it allows you to display the fields that  you  
are interested in. For example, if you are an active intraday stock 
trader, instead of the default layout that is built-in, you may want 
to rearrange the fields in the following order:<p>

<h4> symbol-name,last,bid,ask,bidsize,asksize,trade-volume,time</h4>

To access this custom layout feature, press C (Control), S (Settings), 
L (Layout) while in text mode. DollarLink will then allow you to define 
your own order.<p>

One drawback the custom layout had was that the symbol names could 
not be color-coded the way they are in the default layout (red if 
the symbol is down for the day, green if it is up for the day).<p>

Color-coding is a useful and popular feature and we have received 
many requests to incorporate that into the custom layout.<p>

We now display the symbol names the same way as is done in the default 
layout mode. No matter where you decide to have the symbol name, it 
is now color-coded by price.<p>

<h2>Upgrades Policy</h2>

Upgrades  with the above enhancements  will be available 
after the 15th of April.<p>

Upgrades are yours for the asking,  except  for those customers 
who bought DollarLink but have not paid the annual support & upgrades 
fee. The upgrades always have the latest updated manual included as 
a file on disk; new printed manuals are available for $20 to cover 
production and shipping costs.<p>

Preparing and shipping the upgrades is a lot of work for us, so 
please only ask for an upgrade if you are planning to use it. <p>

<h2>Good Friday Holiday</h2>

DollarLink Software will be closed on Good Friday, April 5, 1996.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>5100 Datapoints Per Window</h3>

In the last year, trading volumes have increased dramatically. It 
is now routine to have a 300 million share day at the NYSE stock exchange. 
A 400 million share day doesn't raise an eyebrow anymore.<p>

<h4>High Trading Volumes</h4>

Some stocks have experienced tremendous upsurge in volume on some 
days (usually due to disappointing earning reports). Intel, IBM and 
Micron are just some of the stocks that have had 20 million share 
days.<p>

The high trading NYSE and OTC volumes are affecting the commodities 
pits as well. It is now fairly common for the S&P futures to have 
4000 or more ticks in a trading session.<p>

<h4>DollarLink's Storage Capacity</h4>

This increase in trading activity has an impact on DollarLink's ability 
to store and display intraday charts.<p>

Until now DollarLink was able to store and display up to 3600 datapoints 
(ticks) in each charting window. This used to be sufficient, but now 
that number is exceeded for quite a few trading instruments. When 
that happens, DollarLink discards the oldest third of the data in 
the affected window to make room for quotes that are anticipated to 
come in. As a result, the chart does not display a full day's action.<p>

<h4>3600 vs. 1500 choice</h4>

The solution that we've offered until now to DollarLink users who 
want to see a full day's chart was to switch to the 1500 datapoints/window 
mode. In that mode, DollarLink stores and displays ticks every 20 
seconds, and, although you won't see every tick, you will get a pretty 
good picture of the full day's action. The chart will be similar to 
the 3600-mode chart, only a bit sparer because it has fewer points.<p>

However, some users must have and see  every  tick.<p>

<h4>Memory Limitations</h4>

We've been working on increasing the datapoints capacity for some 
time now. It is a tough problem because of the 640K bytes memory limitation 
in DOS. We already take full advantage of extended (that's what all 
memory above the 640K memory is called) memory in a PC, but some data 
arrays and some DollarLink code instructions must remain in the 640K 
(called  lower  or  conventional ) memory of the PC. <p>


<h4>We Increased It to 5100</h4>

We've been able to increase the datapoints capacity to  5100  
per window. However, this was achieved as a compromise: When you choose 
the 5100 option in SETUP (Part 1, Question 5), DollarLink will switch 
to displaying at most 4, not 8, windows/screen.<p>

<h4>Caveats</h4>

The 5100-datapoints option should be used only with high-end 486 or 
Pentium PCs. It takes more CPU effort to chart, say, 5000 ticks than 
3000 ticks.<p>

Your PC should have at least 4 MB, preferably 8 MB, of installed RAM and
about 600K or more of conventional memory free before you start
DollarLink.<p>

If you don't have enough RAM for the 5100-datapoints mode, DollarLink 
will complain whenever you try to replace symbols in windows or perform 
some studies.<p>

If you have a large portfolio (over 750 symbols), then even the 600K 
may not be enough and you will have to use an aggressive memory manager 
such as QEMM in order to squeeze more conventional RAM out of your 
PC.<p>

You can switch to either the 1500 or the 3600 or the 5100 datapoints/window 
mode at any time by running our SETUP program and choosing question 
5 in Part 1. It is a multi-part question.<p>

<h3>DollarLink Newsletters on Web</h3>

We are expanding our use of the Internet as a communications medium.<p>

You can now read all our newsletters for the past year  --  including 
this one  --  at our Web site. The address is<p>

 http://www.dollarlink.com/news.htm <p>

As the Internet becomes more and more widely used, we expect to transfer 
more and more of our administrative tasks away from the postal service 
to the Internet.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>End-Point Moving Average Study</h3>

We have added a new study, called End-Point Moving Average (EPMA). 
We believe this feature is exclusive to DollarLink.<p>

An End-Point Moving Average is based on linear regression analysis. 
A regression line is a statistical concept (see the November 30, 1995 
DollarLink newsletter). It is a straight line between a series of 
data points such that the sum of deviations of all data points from 
the line is the minimum. In technical analysis, the regression line 
typically represents a trend line that incorporates the effect of 
all price data. It is an effective tool because prices will tend to 
oscillate about the regression line. DollarLink allows you to draw 
regression lines and standard deviation channels above/below by pressing 
DDR  (Data, Draw, Regression).<p>

An EPMA is similar to an arithmetic moving average in the sense that 
it needs a set of datapoints (as opposed to an exponential MA which 
requires only the value of the current exponential MA and the new 
price value).<p>

Similar to the procedure for an arithmetic moving average, DollarLink 
calculates the definition of a regression line for a set of data.  Then 
it computes the value of the last (rightmost) point by using the equation 
of the line.  That becomes the first value of the EPMA.  Then DollarLink 
repeats the procedure for the set of data shifted to the right by 
one datapoint.  It continues in this fashion until it goes through 
all the data in the chart.<p>

An EPMA is more sensitive than an arithmetic or exponential moving 
average. If you are using moving averages as part of your trading 
decision-making, take note that EPMA appears to generate better buy/sell 
signals than arithmetic or exponential moving averages.<p>

One simple, but effective, set of rules: go long when the price chart 
itself goes above (from below) the EPMA  and  the EPMA is moving 
up, and go short when the EPMA is moving down  and  the price 
goes below (from above) the EPMA. You can use the same parameters 
as for an arithmetic moving average.<p>

For bar charts, an EPMA can be based on opens, highs, lows, or closes 
of a bar.  For intraday line charts, an EPMA is based on price data 
in a user-set number of minutes.<p>

Similar in its treatment of arithmetic moving averages, DollarLink 
allows you to plot up to 3 EPMAs on the same chart. EPMAs can also 
be dynamic, i.e. update automatically with incoming price quotes.<p>

Due to the high computational effort involved, you should 
use this EPMA study only with a powerful PC (66 MHz 486 or faster).<p>

<h2>E-Mail Addresses Wanted</h2>

With the information superhighway going to more and more places, we 
find it very convenient to communicate with our DollarLink clients 
by E-mail. This is especially true for clients abroad or on the move.<p>

Not only can we promptly answer questions our customers may have about 
DollarLink, but most of the time we can send our customers the latest 
updates of DollarLink itself by E-mail. Thus, instead of waiting several 
days, a customer may get his update the very day he requests it.<p>

If you have an E-mail address, please let us know by E-mailing it 
to us. Our E-mail addresses are  dollarwin@aol.com  (on America 
On Line) or  dollar@creative.net  (on the Internet). You can use 
either one to send us E-mail. We usually check the  dollar@creative.net  
address more often.<p>

If you are planning to join the Internet world but are confused by 
all the choices, we suggest America On Line (AOL). Their software 
is usually the smoothest to install and use. In addition to E-mail, 
AOL has a lot of informational depth and, of course, it has easy access 
to the Internet.<p>

Later on, if you really get hooked on the Internet, then you should 
get a flat-fee account with an Internet Service Provider. (We don't 
suggest this type of an account for beginners because it is more difficult 
to set up and use.)<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Regression Lines and Standard Deviations Lines</h3>

The regression lines that we introduced last month will now ask the 
user if he wants to see lines parallel to the regression line drawn 
one standard deviation above and below the main regression line.<p>

This is a convenient addition to the regression lines tool because 
it creates a channel where it becomes easier to see possible breakouts.<p>

<h4>Another addition:</h4>

The user is now also asked if he wants to use all the datapoints in 
the underlying chart or just the last N.  If the user indicates N, 
then DollarLink will ask the user to enter a number.  The idea here 
is to allow the user to create a regression line that would attempt 
to fit all the data in the chart, or one that would attempt to put 
more emphasis on the latest N datapoints.<p>

<h3>Global Options Sorting: Puts <i>or</I> Calls</h3>

<i>Signal datafeed only </i><p>

One of the features of DollarLink is the ability to rank (by percent 
change and/or volume) up to 20 stocks or stock options on an  entire  
exchange without those stocks/options being in the user portfolio.<p>

Thus, you can have the 20 best performers (in real time) on the whole 
NYSE, for example, or, say, the 20 most active stocks on the NASDAQ 
with the price between $10 and $33 per share.<p>

This powerful feature can also operate on equity and index options. 
You can specify similar price and volume constraints and DollarLink 
will construct a live, constantly changing database of options that 
meet the constraints.<p>

Until now this database did not distinguish between puts and calls, 
so some of our customers, who have become quite dependent on this 
unique feature in DollarLink, have requested us to add the choice 
of puts or calls to the list of constraints.<p>

Now, when you go to the S)trategies, S)et, etc. section where you 
specify what exchange, price and/volume range you want the globally 
ranked database to concentrate on, it will ask you if you want puts, 
calls, or both (if you have specified OPRA as the exchange).<p>

This is convenient if you want to concentrate, say, on calls only.  Also, 
for example, on a down day, you may want to look more at top-ranked 
puts than at calls.<p>

<h2>Status of DollarWin Signal Report</h2>

As previously reported here, we produce a mutual funds advisory electronic 
newsletter available as a Signal Report.  The report follows about 
300 mutual funds on a daily basis and makes switching decisions for 
four model portfolios every Friday.  The report, called DollarWin, 
is broadcast daily over the Signal datafeed.  It is also available 
now through the Internet.<p>

The model portfolios in DollarWin differ by the number of mutual funds 
in each portfolio.  (In theory, the more funds, the lower the risk.) 
Thus, we have a two-, four- and eight-fund portfolios.  In addition, 
we also have a Fidelity-Selects-only four-fund portfolio.  DollarWin 
is more aggressive than other mutual funds newsletters, with funds 
being held on average about two months.  DollarWin uses technical 
analysis exclusively to make its decisions.<p>

In 1995, a year when it was difficult to beat the general market, 
the DollarWin model did extremely well.  The two-fund model finished 
up 46.9%.  The four-fund model finished up 47.9%.  The eight-fund 
model finished up 46.2% and the four-fund Selects model finished up 
40%.  (For comparison, the S&P 500 finished up 34%.)<p>

If you are interested in trying DollarWin via Signal, call DBC at 
800-S-MARKET.  If you are interested in DollarWin via the Internet, 
or if you have specific questions on DollarWin, e-mail or fax us.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Regression Lines</h3>

DollarLink can now draw regression lines over a price chart. The chart 
can be either bar chart or tick-by-tick line chart.<p>

A regression line is a statistical concept. It is a straight line 
between a series of data points such that the sum of deviations of 
all data points from the line is the minimum. In technical analysis, 
the regression line typically represents a trend line that incorporates 
the effect of all price data. <p>

Basically, it is a way of drawing a trendline that is more accurate 
than doing it by eyeballing the underlying price data.<p>

To use this feature, press  DDR  (Data, Draw, Regression) while 
in graphics mode.<p>

If the underlying chart is a line chart, DollarLink will ask you for 
a time period that the regression line will span. For example, if 
you say 30 minutes, then the regression line will be computed based 
on the data in the last 30 minutes of price quotes.<p>

If the underlying chart is a bar chart, DollarLink will ask you for 
the number of bars to use in its calculation of the regression line. 
If the chart is a historic bar chart (i.e., if it spans more than
one day of price history), then DollarLink will ask 
you if you want to compute the regression line based on either the 
opens or the highs or the lows or the lasts or the averages of open-high-low-close.<p>

After you choose the color for the line, DollarLink draws the line 
and asks you if you want to move it (with the option of keeping the 
original line) elsewhere on the chart but always parallel to the original 
line. This is a handy way of creating a channel representation with 
these regression lines.<p>

After the line is drawn, DollarLink considers it just like any other 
straight line that you might draw: it is remembered and can be recalled 
at any time by pressing the F4 key.<p>

Whenever you recall this regression line, keep in mind that 
it is redrawn based on its slope and intercept at the time it was 
first drawn.  In other words, it may not correspond to the regression 
line at recall time because the price chart may now have additional 
bars or ticks on it.  To see a regression line that reflects the latest 
price bars, you should go through the DDR sequence, which is easy 
enough.<p>

You can also set an alarm on this trend line so that it becomes a 
live  trend line: DollarLink alerts you whenever the price chart 
penetrates the line from either above or below.<p>

<h3>Change Interest Rates on the Fly</h3>

You can now change interest rates without having to go out of DollarLink. 
This feature is used mostly in calculations of theoretical option 
prices. It is interesting  --  and instructive  --  to see the large 
effect interest rates have on option prices.<p>

To use this feature, in text mode press  CSI  (Control, Settings, 
Interest rates). DollarLink will then prompt you for the new rate 
value.<p>

<h2>Ho Ho Holiday Schedule</h2>

DollarLink Software will be closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day. 
We will also be closed December 26th through 29th. However, for emergency 
questions only, you can still call us and we will try to help you.<p>

DollarLink Software wishes you <p>

<i>a fun-filled holiday season  
and  
a wonderful and prosperous  
New Year!</i><p>

<h1>DollarLink News -- October 30, 1995</h1>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>


 

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Increased Number of Time & Sales Symbols</h3>

.T&S files are ASCII files that report all the Time & Sales information 
for each symbol in the portfolio. Until now they were restricted to 
120 top symbols in the portfolio.<p>

.T&S files were introduced a few months ago into DollarLink and have 
proven to be quite popular. They are useful for traders who study 
market dynamics, usually for intraday trading purposes. Some customers 
have DollarLink running on a network and can analyze the .T&S files 
on another PC on the network concurrently with DollarLink creating 
them.<p>

You can now get Time and Sales .T&S files for  all  symbols in 
your portfolio.<p>

To tell DollarLink to use this feature is quite simple. Just start 
DollarLink with<p>

$  TXT.T&S:ALL [enter]<p>

The number of symbols in the overall Time & Sales file (.TIC) is still 
limited to 120. But if you are using the .T&S files, there are no 
limits.<p>

Since this implies that you can have .T&S files for up to 1000 symbols,
some warnings are in order.<p>

If you have a lot of symbols in your portfolio, keep in mind that 
the .T&S files will use up a lot of hard disk space; we estimate about 
20 Mbytes/day. Thus, it is important to dispose of these files at 
the completion of a trading day; otherwise you are going to run out 
of space even if you have a 1.6 Gbyte hard disk. The best way is probably 
to let DollarLink delete them at the start of a new trading day. You 
set this option in Question 23 of Part 1 of SETUP.<p>

DollarLink will even check your hard disk at startup to see if you 
have at least 20 Mbytes free for this  TXT.T&S:ALL  feature. If 
you don't have enough space, DollarLink will warn you and will save 
only up to 120 .T&S files. As a rule of thumb, you should have about 
50 MBytes free, just to be comfortable.<p>

This feature is best used with very fast, Pentium-class
PCs.  If the PC is not fast enough, it may start losing some quotes 
because the PC may be too busy writing Time & Sale information to 
the hard disk all the time.<p>

<h4>Selective .T&S</h4>

To alleviate this CPU and hard disk crunch, you can also 
specify whether you want only those stocks whose symbols have 3 or 
less letters by entering<p>

$   TXT.T&S:ALL:NY [enter]<p>

or only those stocks whose symbols have 4 or more letters by entering<p>

$   TXT.T&S:ALL:OTC [enter]<p>

<h4>Utility to Manage .T&S Files</h4>

To better manage all these .T&S files, we've added a utility called 
ADDTS. Just enter <p>

ADDTS [enter]<p>

from the DollarLink directory when you are not running DollarLink 
and it will combine all the .T&S files into a compressed file and 
then delete the individual .T&S files.<p>

ADDTS is designed to create a separate compressed file for each day's 
collection of .T&S files. ADDTS uses the LHA.EXE compression program 
that comes with DollarLink.<p>

Each compressed file will be called TSMMDDYY.LZH where MM is the month, 
DD is the day and YY is the year. For example, TS091795.LZH would 
be the file that contains all the compressed .T&S files for 9/17/95.<p>

To extract all the .T&S files from a specific TSMMDDYY.LZH file, from 
the DOS prompt in the DollarLink directory enter<p>

LHA  E  TSMMDDYY [enter]<p>

<h3>Forex Quotes On Signal Datafeed</h3>

We modified DollarLink to be able to process Forex quotes.<p>

Forex on Signal means CrossMar Foreign Exchange Rates. Forex based 
on U.S. rates will work with all Signal receivers. Forex based on 
cross rates will work only on the the 19.2K cable feed in the U.S. 
or the satellite feed in Europe.<p>

DollarLink can now process commodities-type quotes whose root is now 
either 2 or 3 letters and the name contains an  -XX  type suffix.<p>

For example,  JPY A0-FX or NI Z5-SI .<p><p>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>


<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Fixed Number of Days in Historical Charts</h3>

With historical charts (5-, 15-, 30-, 60-minutes and daily), DollarLink 
normally keeps adding bars to the chart. Thus, a 5-minute bar chart 
that initially may have had only 2 days' worth of bars, can get bigger 
and bigger (up until the window limit, which would be about 12 days 
for 5-minute charts).<p>

We have now added a way to keep the same number of days in a chart 
and just keep dropping the data for the oldest day at the start of 
each day.<p>

Whenever you replace a chart in a window, if it is a historical chart, 
DollarLink will now ask you if you want the number of days in that 
chart to be fixed. If you say  yes,  then DollarLink will 
retain only N days in a chart at the start of a day. N is defined 
in SETUP (part 1, questions 30 through 33) as the maximum number of 
days you can put up in a chart when you replace a chart.<p>

<h3>Regain 2-Digit $SPY Accuracy</h3>

As you will recall, the $SPY market index is a DollarLink-computed 
symbol that is a copy of the $SPX symbol but with two digits of accuracy.<p>

Recently, with the stock market's big runup, the $SPY has become too 
large and has lost its second digit of accuracy. There is a fix to 
that, however, that does not require an update from us.<p>

When DollarLink starts up, it looks for a file in the main DollarLink 
directory called ACCURATE that tells DollarLink which symbols it has 
to treat differently to retain an extra digit of accuracy. If DollarLink 
does not find this file, it relies on a built-in list.<p>

You can modify (or create) the ACCURATE file as shown below. Then 
the $SPY will have two digits of accuracy again.<p>

The file ACCURATE is a simple text file that you can modify or create 
with a text editor or word processor (tell the word processor to save 
the end result as an ASCII file). The file should have 9 lines as 
shown:<p>

<pre>
SPX,SPY 
OEX,OEY 
XMI,XMY 
UTIL,UTYL 
IN X,IN Y 
dummy,dummy 
COMP,COMP 
dummy,dummy 
480.00
</pre>


That's it. Either create this file if it does not exist in the DollarLink
directory, or from the DollarLink directory load the existing ACCURATE 
file into a text editor and modify it there.<p>

<h3>Windows 95 and DollarLink</h3>

DollarLink runs fine under Windows 95.  Once it is running, in order 
to enable the big + key (to switch between text and graphics) at the 
far right of the keyboard, select the DollarLink windows properties 
and turn off the Fast ROM emulation in the Screen tab.<p>

You can also create a startup (PIF) file in the Windows Startup that 
calls either the $.BAT or the $$.BAT batch files to start DollarLink.<p>

Finally, one of our customers pointed out to us that you can disable 
Windows 95 altogether and just use it as DOS 7 (and presumably take 
advantage of its faster disk access capability).  Just edit the C:\MSDOS.SYS 
file and change the line GUIBOOT=1 to GUIBOOT=0.  (If you still want 
to go into Windows after that, just enter WIN [enter] at the DOS prompt.)<p>

<h2>Internet: We're On The Web</h2>

We now have a page on the World Wide Web.  Like most of the pages 
on the Web, our page is an electronic  billboard  on the information 
superhighway.  It describes some of the products DollarLink Software 
is involved in.  The products are: DollarLink; STS, a mutual-fund 
timing e-mail-based advisory service; and DollarWin, a Signal Report 
on mutual funds. Both the STS and DollarWin pages display some performance 
charts that show how well we have invested this year (up about 45% 
on the average).<p>

The address (or the Universal Resource Locator  --  url for short 
in Internet jargon) of DollarLink Software's site is<p>

http://www.dollarlink.com<p>

If you have access to the Web  --  remember that now CompuServe, 
America On Line, and Prodigy have gateways to the Web  --  please 
visit our site and take a look around.<p>

By the way, both DBC and PC Quote have their own sites on the Web.<p>

DBC:  http://www.dbc.com <p>
and PC Quote:  http://www.pcquote.com.<p>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>


<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

 
<h3>Time or Ticks on X-axis</h3>

In DollarLink, an intraday chart normally has the time of day on the 
X-axis. When a new quote is charted it is placed at the X-axis position 
that corresponds to the time of day when that quote came in.<p>

Several clients have requested an ability to have charts where the 
X-axis is not based on time of day but rather on the number of ticks 
from the start of the day. <p>

In this ticks-on-X-axis mode, all incoming quotes are placed one after 
another on the X-axis and the time between quotes is ignored. Thus, 
there may have been ten trades in one minute and then a pause of, 
say, two minutes before the next trade. This mode would ignore that 
two minute gap and chart all quotes consecutively. (The regular time-on-X-axis 
mode would show the ten trades bunched up together and then there 
would be a spacing equivalent to two minutes before the next trade.)<p>

All the clients who have requested this feature claim that the ticks-on-X-axis 
mode gives them extra insight. It is interesting to note that all 
these clients are active intraday S&P futures traders.<p>

Now you can choose between the two modes. Make the targeted intraday 
chart window active and press GT (Graphs, Ticks). DollarLink will 
then remember this change and plot the chart in the ticks-on-X-axis 
mode. To go back to the regular mode, press the same GT keys.<p>

Since each window remembers its own mode, you can have the same symbol 
plotted in two different intraday windows with the two different X-axis 
modes. You can then see the differences in the charts. (We confess, 
though, that the additional insight is not obvious to us.)<p>

You can tell at a glance a window's mode by the presence or absence 
of an asterisk next to the symbol name in that intraday window. For 
example if a window's chart's symbol name says SP U5* that means it 
is in the ticks-on-X-axis mode. <p>

Note that if you want to manually rescale the X-axis of an intraday 
window that is using the ticks-on-X-axis mode, it is best to use the 
graphical zoom & pan approach (press Z and move the resizing rectangle 
with either the arrows or the mouse).<p>

<h3>Forex Quotes On Signal Datafeed</h3>

We are modifying DollarLink to be able to process Forex quotes. It 
should be completed by next month.<p>

Forex on Signal means CrossMar Foreign Exchange Rates. Forex based 
on U.S. rates will work with all Signal receivers. Forex based on 
cross rates will work only on the the 19.2K cable feed in the U.S. 
or the satellite feed in Europe.<p>

<h2>Updates Policy</h2>

Updates  with the above enhancements  will be available after 
the 15th of September.<p>

Updates are yours for the asking,  except  for those customers 
who bought DollarLink but have not paid the annual support & updates 
fee. The updates always have the latest updated manual included as 
a file on disk; new printed manuals are available for $20 to cover 
production and shipping costs.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

 
<h3>Symbols Dictionary</h3>

We've added the ability to create a symbols dictionary. Now you can 
call up the long company name associated with a symbol or comments 
about a particular symbol.  <p>

This feature allows you to easily enter detailed names of stocks, 
commodities, custom indices, etc. or to make notes to yourself.<p>

To access this feature, while in text mode, put the cursor over the 
target symbol and press the 9-key.  <p>

If the symbol is an option, DollarLink will just display its long 
name. Otherwise, DollarLink will search the dictionary file (called 
SYMBOLS.DCT ) for the symbol.<p>

If the symbol is not in the dictionary, DollarLink will ask you if 
you want to add a description sentence to the dictionary.  This is 
the way you would add entries to this dictionary.  (We do not supply 
symbol dictionaries with our software; the user creates his own customized 
dictionary.)<p>

If the symbol is in the dictionary, DollarLink will show its associated 
long name or whatever descriptive sentence you might have previously 
entered for this symbol.  It will also ask you if you want to modify 
the descriptive sentence.<p>

The file  SYMBOLS.DCT  is a straightforward ASCII file.  It can 
be modified (or created) with a word processor or text editor if you 
are outside of DollarLink.  The structure of each entry is simple: 
each line in the file consists of<p>

symbol name; description sentence.<p>

For example,<p>

<pre> 
IBM; International Business Machines 
AAPL; Apple Computers (makers of Macintosh) 
SP U5; S&P 500 Sept'95 futures contract 
$$SP;  Poor man's  S&P: futures from $SPX and $PREM 
INTC; bought Intel on 7/31/95 for 65 per share 
</pre>

<h3>More Checks on Options</h3>

For background equity options, during market hours, DollarLink can 
now ignore options that belong to stocks in your portfolios that have 
not traded today.  This helps eliminate  dead  options.<p>

To activate this feature, start DollarLink with the additional  DEADO  
word:<p>

$  DEADO  [enter]<p>

<h2>Updates Policy</h2>

Updates  with the above enhancements  will be available after 
the 15th of August.<p>

Updates are yours for the asking,  except  for those customers 
who bought DollarLink but have not paid the annual support & updates 
fee. The updates always have the latest updated manual included as 
a file on disk; new printed manuals are available for $20 to cover 
production and shipping costs.<p>

<IMG SRC="stripe.gif" ALT="----------------------------------"><p>


<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Separate Time & Sales ASCII Files</h3>

DollarLink can save incoming trade data for up to 120 symbols into 
a time-and-sales files. Now you can also tell DollarLink to keep building 
separate  time-and-sales files for each one of these 120 symbols 
as well. <p>

These separate files have the extension .T&S and are in an ASCII format 
already. For example, if you have  IBM, $INDU  and  SP U5  
in the first 120 symbols of the portfolio, then you will be building 
T&S files called  IBM.T&S, $INDU.T&S  and  SP_U5.T&S. <p>

Each incoming quote gets appended to its corresponding .T&S file. 
The format of each line in the files is<p>

MM/DD/YY,HH:MM:SS,price,trade volume,total volume<p>

The main purpose of this feature is to be able to access these data 
files while running DollarLink in a multitasking environment or on 
a network. That's why they are saved in an ASCII format. You can readily 
copy the data into another application that is running concurrently 
with DollarLink (either on the same PC or over the network).<p>

DollarLink deletes all the .T&S files at the start of a new trading 
day so that you start with new files every day. If you exit and restart 
DollarLink during the day, the .T&S files are not deleted.<p>

If you have DollarLink set up to  not  delete the intraday tick-by-tick 
files (files that have the extension .DAY; set in Question 23 of Part 
1 of SETUP), then the .T&S files will not be deleted either.<p>

Keep in mind that turning on the .T&S files  may  use up to about 
8 megabytes each day, so it is important to have a big hard disk with 
lots of free space. You really have to watch it if you are not letting 
DollarLink delete the .T&S files at the start of each day.<p>

To activate this T&S feature, first make sure that you have the time-and-sales 
feature turned on (Question 41 in Part 1 of SETUP). Then, whenever 
you start DollarLink, add the string  TXT.T&S  as follows:<p>

$   TXT.T&S [enter]<p>

<h3>Keeping Yesterday's Signal Reports</h3>

Due to an increased number of Signal Reports, the Signal datafeed 
is now transmitting these reports fewer times per day.  It used to 
be that a report was broadcast at, say 10 p.m. on one day and re-broadcast 
again before trading began the next day.  Not anymore.<p>

At the beginning of a new day, DollarLink  sweeps  all reports 
and headlines into an  MM-DD-YY.NUS  file.  Thus, if you want 
to see that 10 p.m. report, you can read or search the .NUS file.<p>

We have now modified DollarLink to keep one-day-old Signal Reports 
to make them available to read or search.<p>

If you now start DollarLink with<p>

$  SRW [enter]<p>

then DollarLink will keep yesterday's Signal Reports and you can read 
them as if they were broadcast today.  This makes it more convenient.  The 
downside is that it takes DollarLink longer to get going when you 
first start it up because it has to do more sorting and checking of 
old news and report files in order to figure out what to keep and 
what to throw away.<p>

<h2>4th of July Holiday</h2>

DollarLink will be closed Monday, July 3, and Tuesday, July 4, for 
the Independence Day holiday.<p>

                         <i>Have a happy 4th! <i><p>

<h3>Trades-At-Bid or At-Ask Custom Index</h3>

We have created a custom index that attempts to measure traders'  opinion  
of a stock's price direction.  The index keeps track of all the trades 
that were done that day at the ask (or bid) price.  The idea behind 
the index is as follows: if the buyer is willing to buy at the ask 
price (rather than at the bid or somewhere between the bid and the 
ask), then he is bullish on the stock and is willing to pay a little 
more right now.  Similarly, if a seller is willing to sell at the 
bid, it means he is bearish on the stock.<p>

Each index (bid or ask) keeps a running daily total of all the trades 
that were executed at the bid or at the ask.<p>

A useful application of this concept is to create one index for the 
trades at bid and another for the trades at ask. Then create another 
custom index which would be trades-at-ask index divided by trades-at-bid 
index.  If you then chart this final index, the trend of that chart 
often tells whether the bulls or the bears are dominating. In other 
words, if it slopes upward as the trading day progresses, it means 
there are more at-ask trades than at-bid trades which indicates buying 
pressure.<p>

<h3>Autorepositioning and Price Tickmarks</h3>

In DollarLink, the user can either specify the interval of the price 
tickmarks on a chart or let DollarLink determine it automatically.  The 
drawback of doing it automatically is that sometimes DollarLink comes 
up with non-whole numbers for the tickmark intervals.<p>

Until now, if the price went outside the current chart window and 
DollarLink had to rescale the window's coordinates in order to fit 
all the chart data, then it may have modified the tickmark size.  Now, 
if you specify the tickmark size [by pressing G (Graph), R (Rescale) 
and U (User-set tickmarks)] while in graphics, DollarLink will ask 
you if you want to preserve the tickmark size even if it autorepositions 
the chart. It will then keep that tickmark interval. <p>

<h3>Dow-Jones Over 4400 and Charts</h3>

Due to a numerical limitation that was programmed into DollarLink 
several years ago, DollarLink would not chart a price higher than 
4400. (It stores the data correctly, though.) Thus, when the Dow-Jones 
went over 4400 about a month ago, we got a lot calls from DollarLink 
users.<p>

Well, it took us a few days to remove that limitation from DollarLink 
and we've sent out a lot of updates with the fix.<p>

If you are seeing this problem with your DollarLink and would like 
to correct it, please request an update from us. All updates are free 
to  currently active  customers.<p>

Active customers include all renters, all those on a six-month lease, 
all purchasers within the last 12 months, or purchasers who have paid 
the $300 support fee within the last 12 months. Call us if you wish 
to check or change your status. <p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

 
<h3>Custom $TICK</h3>

By popular demand, we have created a  tick  custom index.  This 
is analogous to the $TICK or $TIKI that the NYSE provides.  Every 
30 seconds (the number of seconds can be set by user in SETUP) this 
index takes all the stocks in your portfolio whose last trade was 
an uptick and subtracts all the stocks whose last trade was a downtick.  Thus, 
you can have your own $TICK for all the stocks in your portfolio.<p>

If you have other symbols in the portfolio (commodities, other indices,
options, etc.), DollarLink ignores them for this computation. It only
looks at all your stocks.<p>

The reported value is actually the computed net tick divided by 10, 
i.e.,<p>

net tick = 0.1 * (uptickers - downtickers)<p>

We divide by 10 to prevent numeric overflow since custom indices cannot 
handle negative numbers less than 800. Thus a value, say, of 1.90 
actually means that there 19 more uptick stocks than downtick stocks.<p>

To create this custom index, while on the quote pages, press P (Portfolio), 
then C (Custom) and after giving it a name, choose type 1. The coefficient 
is 1 and the symbol name can be any stock symbol in your portfolio.  Then, 
when DollarLink asks you what field to use, choose V.  That's it.<p>

If you want this custom index to update more often than every 30 seconds, 
(i) make this index an instant custom index (they update with every 
incoming tick for the underlying stock; their names start with $$$), 
and (ii) when DollarLink asks you for the stock symbol name, pick 
a heavily traded stock symbol.<p>

<h3>Raw Stochastics Custom Index</h3>

We have created a custom index which should be useful for fast intraday 
traders.  It computes the raw stochastics using the latest price, 
day high and day low.<p>

The formula is <p>

index = 100 * (P - L) / (H - L)<p>

where P is the latest price, H is the current intraday high, L is 
the current intraday low.<p>

This index is very similar to a raw stochastics study, but doesn't 
require the symbol being analyzed to be charted in a window.<p>

It's a simple formula, but we find it surprisingly helpful for intraday 
trading.  Intraday highs and lows represent resistance and support 
points and intraday traders take them into consideration.  Thus, 
once this index approaches either extreme, the price will quite often 
bounce away from that extreme.  Also, if the price does penetrate 
either the high or low, in other words, once a resistance or support 
is broken, the price is likely to continue in the same direction for 
a while. Then, when the price stabilizes, that price level becomes 
the new support/resistance.<p>

To create this custom index, while on the quote pages, press P (Portfolio), 
then C (Custom) and after giving it a name, choose type 1. The coefficient 
is 1.0. Then give it the name of the symbol that this formula will operate 
on. Then, when DollarLink asks you about what field to use, choose 
W.  That's it.<p>

<h2>Status of DollarWin Signal Report</h2>

As reported here over a year ago, we produce a mutual funds advisory 
newsletter as a Signal Report.  The report follows about 300 mutual 
funds on a daily basis and makes switching decisions for four model 
portfolios every Friday.  The report is broadcast daily over the Signal 
datafeed.<p>

Recently, many DollarLink users have been inquiring about this report, called 
DollarWin . (Perhaps this is because it's quite hard to beat 
the S&P index when it's up 12% year-to-date.)<p>

The DollarWin report is doing quite well.  The model portfolios in 
DollarWin differ by the number of mutual funds in each portfolio.  (In 
theory, the more funds, the lower the risk.)  Thus we have a two-, 
four- and eight-fund portfolios.  In addition, we also have a Fidelity-Selects-only 
four-fund portfolio.   DollarWin is more aggressive than other mutual 
funds newsletters, with funds being held on the average about two 
months.  DollarWin uses technical analysis exclusively to make its 
decisions.<p>

As of 4/28/95, the two-fund model is up 12.85% year-to-date.  The 
four-fund model is up 10.29%.  The eight-fund model is up 13.58% and 
the 4-fund Selects model is up 16.06%. (For comparison, the S&P 500 
is up 12.11% and Dow-Jones Industrials are up 12.58%)<p>

If you are interested in trying DollarWin, call DBC at 800-S-MARKET. 
If you have specific questions on DollarWin, e-mail us, fax us, or 
call us.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

<h3>Compressed Page Image Files</h3>

When you switch from one graphics page to another, DollarLink saves 
the image of the page you just left to high memory. Thus, if you come 
back to this page, DollarLink restores it from the saved image the 
way it was before.<p>

Each image takes about 250K bytes. If you keep switching pages, eventually 
you will run out of RAM and DollarLink will start using the hard disk 
to store page image files. (You never see these page image files because 
they are temporary and get deleted when you exit DollarLink.)<p>

Naturally, storing on the hard disk is slower than storing in RAM. 
In an attempt to speed this operation we have added an option to compress 
these page image files. This compression is done on the fly and, depending 
on your PC and hard disk speed, may actually be as fast as the storing 
of the image in high RAM. The compression is quite effective -- about 
4:1.<p>

Of course, since DollarLink knows about this compression, it also 
knows how to decompress a page image file if it has to read it.<p>

To enable this option, start DollarLink<p>

$$  GRX [enter]<p>

That tells DollarLink that if and when the time comes to put the page 
image to disk, it wll compress it on the fly.<p>

<h3>More Reference Percent Lines</h3>

Whenever DollarLink computes and draws a percent-based study (such 
as stochastics) it draws 25%, 50% and 75% horizontal reference lines 
to help the user see the values of the study. <p>

DollarLin can also draw these 25%, 50%, 75% percent lines anytime 
you press  Control+L . For greater resolution, if you press  Control+O , 
DollarLink will draw 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% lines.<p>

For even greater resolution, we have now added the drawing of 5%, 
10%, 15%,20%, 25%,...,95% lines. Press  Control+M  and DollarLink 
will draw these lines across the active window.<p>

<h3>News Notification While in Graphics</h3>

If DollarLink is in the quote-page mode, whenever there is news on 
a stock there is an  N  at the end of the row for that stock.<p>

You will now also see a  (N)  in the upper left corner of each 
graph window where that stock is displayed. This should make it more 
convenient for you if you spend most of the time in the graphics mode. 
(Of course, the best solution is to add a monochrome monitor/graphics 
card so that you can have both text and graphics active at the same 
time.)<p>

<h3>A Research Note On Trends</h3>

In addition to continuously adding new features and refining DollarLink, 
we also do quite a bit of research into successful trading strategies. 
After all, we are also traders, not just computer nerds.<p>

For the past year or so we've been looking at the age-old problem 
of defining price trends. Conventional wisdom says that markets trend 
only about 20% of the time, and the rest of the time they just oscillate. <p>


We don't know how accurate this  20% of the time  claim is, 
but intuitively it seems right. We are more concerned with finding 
some  --  preferably mechanical  --  system that identifies trends.<p>

The whole idea of finding a reliable indication of a trend is controversial. 
After all, it's like trying to predict the future. Physicists will 
tell you it cannot be done, but, as a  saying goes,  Most rocket 
scientists are not rich.  The markets are not governed by laws 
of physics, but by greed and fear. If psychology and sociology weren't 
such dismal sciences, we should be using them.<p>

Controversy aside, having looked at most conventional technical analysis 
concepts that attempt to quantify trends, we don't see much success 
there. A lot of the popular tools seem to work great, but when you 
do a quantitative win-lose analysis, their probabilities hover near 
the 50-50 level. (Perhaps that's why many successful traders don't 
try to beat the odds, but, instead, concentrate on disciplined money 
management tactics.)<p>

We did come across a methodology we reported in this newsletter (and 
added to DollarLink as the  High Chance  option) that looks 
only at very short-term trends in day-to-day commodities trading. 
The High Chance system has been tested historically and some commodities 
do have high probabilities of success.<p>

Most recently we've been looking at trend  persistency,  which 
is a compact way of describing the reliability of a trend. In other 
words, once you think you have a trend, how long will it persist?<p>

Rather than concentrating on what signal-generating tool to use, this 
approach tries to select trading instruments that have historically 
proven to have a better persistency than others.<p>

To identify trends, we've used most of the standard technical analysis 
studies, as well as some chaos theory and statistics. It is interesting 
to note that the choice of a trend-identifying tool is less important 
than the choice of a proper trading instrument. In other words, you 
can't win a race with a bad horse even if you have the best jockey.<p>

So far we have found significant levels of persistency only in day-to-day 
and month-to-month trading of some mutual funds, not stocks or commodities.<p>

We are continuing our research in this area and will keep you posted.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

 
<h3>Easier-To-Draw Horizontal Lines</h3>

In DollarLink, to draw a line over a chart you have to press  DDS  
(Data, Draw, Single line) and then define two points by moving either 
the mouse cursor or the arrow keys. To draw a horizontal line, the 
two points should be at the same vertical location.<p>

Since you need only one defining point to draw a horizontal line across 
a window, we have now made it easy to draw a horizontal line with 
one keystroke or mouse click.  This makes it easier to draw percent 
lines, horizontal support/resistance levels, etc.  Press  DDH  
(Data, Draw, Horizontal line) and just move the mouse cursor to desired 
price level and either click the left button or press  ENTER .  That's 
it.<p>

<h3>More Rigorous Error Checking For Options</h3>

There is a tremendous volume of index and equity options on all datafeeds 
and occasionally we get option records where all the fields (last, 
bid, ask, etc.) are zero.  The number of these  zero  options 
is small relative to the total volume of options, but they do take 
up room and are a mild inconvenience to get rid of. <p>

To release all background options, press C (Control), then 
R (Release) while on the quote pages.  You can do this at any time.  DollarLink 
flushes out all the background options (there can up to 20,000) and 
starts accepting new options.<p>

We have now added more consistency checks for background equity and 
index options in order to eliminate (or at least reduce) these  zero  
option records. Based on our observations so far, it looks like we 
have succeeded.<p>

<h2>Article on Price Spectrum</h2>

There is an interesting article in the March, 1995 issue of  Futures  
magazine. The article is on Market Profile as applied on an intraday 
basis.  It seems that the author has  discovered  price spectrum 
analysis  --  which he calls  micro  analysis  --  and has 
applied it (rather intelligently) to the intraday behavior of various 
commodities.<p>

The author, Daniel Gramza, believes that this micro analysis is a 
recent advance in software development. This is amusing to us because 
we have had intraday price spectrum analysis in DollarLink since 1987. 
And several other market researchers have come up with similar techniques 
(and interpretations of the markets using these techniques) way before 
that.<p>

<h2>Dow Jones News Service Headlines with Signal</h2>

DBC has recently introduced real-time Dow Jones News Service Headlines 
on the Signal datafeed. This feature greatly enhances Signal's news 
headlines reporting. Instead of about 400 daily headlines, you can 
now get about 2,500. Most of the headlines are Wall Street related: 
stocks, bonds and corporate news. For $75 per month it's actually 
a good deal because the full Dow Jones News Service (headlines plus 
the body of the story) costs about $300 per month on other datafeeds,  and 
a headline is really the  meat  of a story. If you are interested, 
call DBC at 800-S-MARKET.<p>

DollarLink fully supports these headlines. However, if you are contemplating 
subscribing to these headlines, beware that they will take up lots 
of hard disk space. You should have about 30 to 40 MB of extra disk 
space available to hold these stories. This is a bit on the conservative 
side, but these days large hard disks are not expensive.<p>

Also, the old cliche  the faster, the better  truly applies 
here because your PC will be bombarded with the headlines and a faster 
PC with a fast hard disk can process them quicker. If you don't know 
if your PC is adequate, call us and we'll try to advise.<p>

<h2>Tip: How to Ignore Datafeed News</h2>

Sometimes news and headlines get in the way of trading and we are 
asked by our customers how to  turn off  the news. <p>

If for whatever reason you want DollarLink  not  to process incoming 
news stories, start DollarLink with<p>

$  NONEWS [enter] <p>

command and it will ignore all news and headlines. This applies to 
DollarLink on all datafeeds.<p>

<h2>Enhancements Added</h2>

 
<h3>Improved Error Checking</h3>

DollarLink scrutinizes every new quote from the datafeed before accepting 
it as a valid price/volume record. This is done continuously throughout 
the day. Each quote gets checked for consistency (for example, the 
high of the day cannot be less than the low of the day; total volume 
must increase during the day) and for error spikes.<p>

DollarLink compares the last accepted price field against the price 
in the incoming quote. If the absolute difference is greater than 
a user-set threshold (the default is 25%), the incoming quote is thrown 
out. <p>

Error-checking can be disabled or changed on the fly while 
in DollarLink by pressing Control+E key combination and then I while 
in text mode. The change will be in effect for the duration of the 
current DollarLink session. To permanently change the error checking 
status, run the SETUP utility outside of DollarLink. The appropriate 
question is 38 in Part 1 of SETUP.<p>

This error checking is quite effective in its attempt to eliminate 
data spikes. However, it may get confused by stock splits. When it 
sees a stock that split, DollarLink  thinks  it is an error 
and sometimes it  throws out the baby with the bath water  
by not accepting the new quote. Typically, the user sees that a stock 
stopped updating and there is an asterisk next to the price on the 
quote pages. The solutions is to disable error checking temporarily 
to allow the new price to come in and be accepted.<p>

To prevent this excessive error checking, we now do not check for 
spike errors on the very first real-time quote of the day. This should 
take care of the splits because stocks usually start trading at the 
new split price at the beginning of the day, not in the middle of 
the day.<p>

You can still force DollarLink to error-check even the first quote 
of the day if you start DollarLink with<p>

$  XERR [enter]<p>

<h3>The Universal VESA Graphics Card</h3>

The world of SuperVGA graphics cards does not have a strong standard. 
IBM introduced the VGA standard around 1987 and all the other graphics 
card makers cloned it. VGA became a  hard  standard; everybody 
followed it. After that, in order to get market share, competing manufacturers 
started enhancing VGA cards by adding more colors and/or higher resolution 
capabilities. Everybody did this on their own without having a universal 
standard in mind. To make matters more confusing, everybody called 
their own design  SuperVGA.  <p>

To clean up this mess, the Video Electonics Standards Association 
(VESA) came up with a set of SuperVGA specifications which the manufacturers 
have more-or-less implemented. However, since VESA is a voluntary 
organization and since most users don't switch graphics cards very 
often, many manufacturers continue to ignore the VESA standard claiming 
that their own design is better.<p>

This is why in DollarLink we supply SuperVGA graphics by brand name 
the SuperVGA standard is not consistent. We also provide a VESA 
driver for both 800 by 600 and the 1024 by 768 resolutions. Unfortunately, 
many graphics cards don't support the VESA standard.<p>

Since we cannot possibly support  all  the proprietary SuperVGA 
standards, we provide a VESA driver for both 800 by 600 and the 1024 
by 768 resolutions. Unfortunately, many graphics card don't support 
the VESA standard.<p>

We have found a possible solution for those of you who have a graphics 
card that does not support VESA. It is a small memory-resident  freeware  
program that figures out what brand of the graphics card you have 
and then  forces  the card to behave like a VESA card. It 
uses about 7K of RAM and can be  loaded high.  <p>

This VESA emulator is called UniVesa and we distribute it with our 
other utilities as part of the package.<p>

It is simple to use. First, run the SETUP program and in part 3 tell 
DollarLink you have a VESA SuperVGA (either 800x600 or 1024x768).<p>

Then, every time before you start DollarLink, execute the following 
command from the DOS prompt while in the DollarLink directory<p>

UNIVESA [enter]<p>

That's it. Now DollarLink will  think  your PC has a VESA 
card. (It also works with the dual-monitor feature in DollarLink, 
if you have it set up that way.)<p>

<h4>Caution:</h4>

UniVesa has been tested with many, but not all, graphics cards. It 
is about a year old and may not work with some of the newer cards.<p>

<h2>3.5" diskettes</h2>

Following the industry-wide trend, we now distribute all our software 
on 3.5" diskettes. If you don't have a 3.5" drive, we strongly suggest 
you have one installed in your PC (the cost of a 3.5" drive is about 
$50). <p>

If you want us to send software updates on 5.25" diskettes, please 
remind us when you request the updates.<p>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>PAINT CHIP REPAIR</H2>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By John Paterek</FONT></B> <BR wp="br1">

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P></CENTER>

<P>Now that the <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911</FONT></B> is the lone Porsche
on the assembly line, the <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Porsche</FONT></B> factory
has decided to switch to base/clear on solid colors. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Mercedes</B>
</FONT>has used this process with success for many years. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BASF</FONT></B>
has developed water borne base coat colors and solvent based clear. </P>

<P>The Germans were required to reduce VOC (volatile organic compounds)
levels and the amount of lead in formulas. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Porsche</FONT></B>
also discontinued the sale of touchup paint (which never really matched)
due to its flammable contents. The result is no source for color other
than <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Glassurit</FONT></B> paint sold at auto supply
shops. You need only 1/2 oz. of color to touchup chips for years. </P>

<P>Chip maintenance should be done after each wash, especially after track
events. The surface should be cool to the touch and done in a non-windy
area. Airborne dust will stick to new paint. <B><I>Never</I></B> sand the
area prior to touchup. This will promote rub through or uneven surface
near the chip. I like to use a tiny artist brush. It allows control of
color to be applied. Remember to clean wax out of the chip with a toothpick.
The surface can also be cleaned with a <B><FONT COLOR="#408000">Q-tip</FONT></B>
and a small amount of non-oily nail polish. Apply touchup in two applications
to a level surface. </P>

<P>Minor polishing with a mixture of <B><FONT COLOR="#408000">Imperial
Hand Glaze and Blue Magic</FONT></B> can help level the surface. Wrap a
piece of T shirt around a metal bottle cap and use as a buffing block.
This is done after required drying time of 1 to 2 weeks has elapsed. Remember
the chip can penetrate four layers: clear, base coat, white primer, black
wash primer. Some rocks can upset the primer and leave rough edges around
the crater. Smooth this off with your fingernail. Remember not to be too
aggressive. A gnat size chip can grow to a fully repainted hood, and that
could be a $700.00 mistake. </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I own a '65 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">356C</FONT></B> coupe. The previous
owner had the Ruby Red <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>color tinted
darker than original</FONT></FONT></B>. I need to refinish the left quarter
panel, any <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>suggestions for a match</FONT></FONT></B>?
Also the problem of &quot;fish eyes&quot; in the final coats of urethane.
Any product recommendation?&quot; </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Response</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>Paint match problems are on the rise now that the EPA has removed lead
from most primary colors. Reds are in that category. They also turn darker
or more purple with age and ultraviolet exposure. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Du
Pont</FONT><FONT COLOR="#408000"> Paints</FONT></B> now has a <B><FONT COLOR="#408000">Chroma
vision camera</FONT>.</B> It is a hand held device that shoots three pictures
of your color and then feeds the data to Dupont's color library. A formula
in chroma base color is produced. The system is a base coat/ clear coat
process. It works! I have had 10 to 12 successful matches using this process.
It is great for original sun faded colors reducing the need for total overall
refinishing. The fisheye problem is a painters nightmare. They are small
crater like voids in the finished color coat. Fish eyes can be repaired
with a drop of color and careful sanding but only on solid colors. The
cause is poly silicones used in wax and polish formulas. To remove, use
a product called <FONT COLOR="#408000"><B>Polycracker prep wash solution</B>.</FONT>
(201-335-2828). It is sprayed on with a mist bottle prior to refinishing
of body panels, wheels and engine sheet metal. It removes all traces of
contaminants therefore giving a fisheye free finish with little effort!
They also make a great silicone free hand cleaner designed for the painting
industry to remove contaminants from your hands. <BR wp="br1">

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>&quot;I own a '90 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911 C2</FONT><FONT COLOR="#E50000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>with early style mirrors</FONT></FONT></B>.
I recently purchased a pair of Aero Style mirrors in a kit from <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AJ
U. S.A</FONT><FONT COLOR="#408000">.</FONT></B> Can I install them by myself?&quot;
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Response</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The new style mirrors will <B>fit </B>door frames from 1978<B><FONT COLOR="#008000">SC</FONT></B>
on. The wiring will work from '87 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Carrera</FONT></B>
to the <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">C2</FONT></B>. For earlier cars the power
leads must be modified or purchase Manual (lighter) mirror kit 964 731
901 0 1. It is about $120.00 less and available from <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">AJ
U. S.A</FONT></B>. The assembly of the mirror base and headpiece is difficult
sometimes requiring 2 people to compress a rather large tension spring
and lock bolt. Be certain your new paint is dry or you will mar the surface
when assembly is attempted. The mirrors can be painted prior to assembly
of components. Before the mirrors are ordered it would be wise to unbolt
the mirror from your <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Porsche</FONT></B>. Check
to see if the doors were repainted, any paint other than the factory baked
enamel will show a sink line under the gasket. It can be sanded with 1200
&amp; 2000 grit and buffed with <B><FONT COLOR="#408000">Blue Magic</FONT></B>
and <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">3M</FONT><FONT COLOR="#408000"> Imperial Hand
Glaze</FONT></B>. If the repair shop failed to remove the mirror when painted,
you will have a dead edge tape mark. The new mirror base is oval in shape
to the square style prior to '91. If not covered, a flaw will be quite
evident. The new mirrors make a great presentation, now all you need are
<B><FONT COLOR="#408000">RS America</FONT></B> 17&quot; wheels! <BR wp="br1">

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>&quot;The <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>gauges</FONT></B> </FONT>on
my '71 <FONT COLOR="#008000">91IT</FONT> that I recently rescued from a
3 year stint in a musty garage have the typical <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>damage
from sun fading and fogging</FONT></FONT></B>. How do I disassemble them
for cleaning? I am retaining the original faces but wonder if day glow
orange paint can be purchased for the tach and speedo needles, any help?&quot;
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Response</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The gauges are exposed to the same film inside them as your <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911</FONT></B>
windows are. Smoking, dampness and plasticsizers from the upholstery will
fog gauges. Some ship them to be rebuilt, but the bezel can be removed
with a dull blade knife. Carefully roll the edge of the bezel. They are
black anodized or painted metal and will open without bending out of shape.
Remove the glass, clean with detergent, anti fog could be used but just
clean works best. Paint the needles with day glow orange aerosol sprayed
into the cap and carefully brush on the needle. It should dry flat in tone.
Clean the faces with a mild detergent, dry and reassemble. Place the clean
glass in a new bezel (purchased from <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">North Hollywood
Speedometer</FONT></B>), check under glass for dust or fingerprints. Press
the face down on a clean table and reroll the bezel with a plastic screwdriver
handle. It will bend but it is time and patience. <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">356</FONT></B>
gauges are assembled the same way with new bezels (chrome plated brass).
Press the edge carefully to prevent cracking of the chrome. <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">North
Hollywood Speedometer</FONT></B> does a great job of assembly; just remind
them not to reset your odometer to ZERO! <BR wp="br1">

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I have a 1980 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911 SC Targa</FONT></B>. I would
like to<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>restore
the metal trim and the out side insignia</FONT></FONT></B> etc. There seems
to be two types of metal involved, the rear window lower trim and the type
around the triangular front window. The Targa roll bar is in decent condition
but will need to be repainted in the future. </P>

<P>My question is how to go about restoring these surfaces. What grit of
sand paper to use, whether to sand the front window trim which looks like
its anodized, was the <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Targa</FONT></B> lettering
black originally. I would like to know the easiest way to mask the body
or any tricks you might have in this area. What is the best type of paint?&quot;

is stainless steel painted matte black. Scripts on <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">SC</FONT></B>'s
are black anodized aluminum as well are trim moldings around the windshield
rear window, vent and door top trim. Door handles are black anodized pot
metal. </P>

<P>You can restore color to the <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911SC</FONT></B>
script and <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Targa</FONT></B> scripts. Remove rear
deck script, sand with 320 and spray with <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Wurth</FONT><FONT COLOR="#408000">
Matte Black</FONT></B>. You can mask the <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Targa</FONT></B>
script by placing paper behind the script carefully. Mask the bar and paint
with <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Wurth</FONT></B>. I would suggest painting
the entire roll bar and script as a unit, after dry sanding the roll bar
with 320 wet or dry. Degrease the surface with <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ditzler</FONT></B>
wax and grease remover or <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Dupont</B> </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#408000">3812S</FONT></B>.
Remove the rear upper glass seal from the bar and mask the entire body
with 6 mil plastic. Mask over the interior (top off) blow off the bar to
remove any dust in the script and apply 3 coats <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Wurth</FONT><FONT COLOR="#408000">
Matte Black</FONT></B>. </P>

<P>You can gun spray with <B><FONT COLOR="#408000">Glasurit Rally Black</FONT></B>
but the <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Wurth</FONT></B> gives the best finish.
Use a respirator and spray in a warm garage with little air flow. You can
also apply this process to door handles and moldings. Be certain to mask
the entire body. Over spray can find its way into the slightest opening.
Be certain to include the fresh air vent on the cowl. Matte Black can be
applied to <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">944</FONT></B> door handles and <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911</FONT></B>
plastic deck grills that turn gray.

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I own an '87 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">911</FONT></B> with the original
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>Bosch headlights</FONT></FONT></B>.
Recently I had to replace a lamp due to rock damage. The <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><FONT SIZE=+1>new
one is crystal clear, the old quite foggy</FONT></FONT></B>. Is there a
way to clean this? </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Response</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The lamp does have access. Remove the bezel and four screws that hold
the assembly to the bucket. Remove the retainer and bulb. I used an acid
brush with a small amount of glass cleaner. Tape the brush to a pencil
for extra length. There are also surgical swabs that can remove additional
residue. The lens will remain clear if cleaned every year or two. <BR wp="br1">

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>I am the proud owner of a new <b><FONT COLOR="#008000">993</FONT></b>. It has
metallic paint and came through without a mark on it. Recently, while <b><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"></b>under
fluorescent light</FONT></b>, I noticed <b><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">water spot rings
on the roof and sunroof panel.</FONT></b> Is this acid rain? How can I remove
it and what other steps would you recommend to keep my car perfect? <BR wp="br1">

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><center><P><font size=+2><B>Response</B></font>
</P></center></P>

<P>The spots you mentioned are mineral deposits from rain. Acid rain is
a pock mark deep in the surface usually from years of neglect. I have removed
this deposit by using <b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">3M</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#008000">Imperial
Hand Glaze</FONT></b> and a small clean section of cotton towel. Polish by
applying the glaze to the towel, buff in one general direction rubbing
until the ring disappears. If this approach fails, place a tiny amount
1/4&quot; of <b><FONT COLOR="#008000">Blue Magic</FONT></b> to the cloth already
covered with <b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">3M</FONT></b>. Again care must be used not
to over buff at once. New <b><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Porsches</FONT></b> need polishing
and waxing to prevent this condition. The metallic base coat is now water-based
with traditional baked enamel clear. It is already hard enough to wax when
delivered. Do so with a good quality canuba wax. Other areas of concern
on the <b><FONT COLOR="#008000">993 </FONT></b>would be the area directly behind
the front wheels. The stone guards are absent. I would make a pair from
<b><FONT COLOR="#008000">911 C2 Turbo</FONT></b> plastic stone guards. Perhaps
the factory will install them as they are aware of the problem. Enjoy your
<b><FONT COLOR="#008000">993</FONT></b>! </P>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Question</FONT></B> </P></CENTER>

<P>The <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">muffler</FONT></B> on my'72 <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">91I
T </FONT></B>has developed some leaks and is due for replacement. I purchased
a used one that has no holes in it and is generally in good shape. What
technique would you suggest to <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">clean this new/used
muffler to prepare it for painting</FONT></B>? And then, which paint will
last well? I'd like to paint it the original gray color for a stock appearance.
<BR wp="br1">

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>
<P><center><P><font size=+2><B>Response</B></font></P></center></P>
<P>The muffler must be in good solid condition to stand up to sandblasting
for rust removal. You should cover the inlet and exhaust tips with duct
tape. The proper finish is available. It is called <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">VHT
1200 degree custom grey - 1041</FONT></B> from <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="http://www.stoddard.com">Stoddard
Imported Cars</A></FONT></B> in Ohio 1-800-342-1414. They sell it in quart
containers to be gun sprayed. 2 coats works well. Start the car after installation
and run only until the paint shows signs of smoking. Shut down the engine
and let cool. The next start up, the muffler will be cured and will not
burn off. <BR wp="br1">

<h3><left> Yes, you have entered the TRC Enterprises self promotion page.  I'm Tom Conklin,  I've started a small computer company out of my home northwest NJ that caters to small offices(SO) and home offices(HO). My specialty is building high quality, in

expensive, custom tailored computer systems. I also do repairs, upgrades, and consulting. My main focus is on DOS based systems, utilizing MSDOS, Windows, Windows95, and Windows NT. E-Mail me if you think I can help your small or home office.</left>

<hr width=25% align=center size=2>
<left>Although I don't do much in the way of programming I have done some stuff with Quick Basic. The biggest project I have done was programming a two axis overhead robot. It was originally designed to automatically clean machined parts in a hazardous ch

emical that has since been outlawed in several parts of the world do to the ozone. Now the robot is used more as a convenience item since the company now uses a much safer chemical. Other programming involved simple animated greeting cards. Again programm

ed in Quick Basic. I have the source code as well as the plans to build your own robot and with a little imagination  you can modify it to do almost anything. The source code for the greeting cards are good for students just learning to program. If anyone

 is interested in any of these  programs E-Mail me. My address is at the bottom of the page. </left>

<hr width=25% align=center size=2>
<left>I became involved with computers about ten years ago with an XT type computer. It had a 20mb mfm type HD and a whole 640 kb of memory, since then it has morphed into a Pentium 75 with a 1.6gb HD and 16mb of ram, Zoom 28.8 fax/voice/modem running Win

dows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 B2. Quite a jump from the old days. Combining all that was my love for sports cars and since I haven't been able to buy a Porsche yet, I grew up driving Volkswagons. I have owned six of them including my current '87 Scirocco 16v

 (background). Each one has served me well. That's how I got involved with Pit-Stop Internet. I happened to love sports cars (European type) and computers. Although I never tried my hand at web publishing before, I think I picked it up rather quickly. I n

ow do the <a href="http://www.pit-stop.com/clubs/clubs.html">Clubs</a> pages and the <a href="http://www.pit-stop.com/carpick">Car of the Month</a> page so have a look and tell me what you think.</left>

<hr width=25% align=center size=2>
<left>What's coming from TRC Enterprises? Well, I'm glad you asked. I am working on drawing my own graphics using Cadkey 7.0. It's a good cad program with a lot of capabilities. Check out the background on the main <a href="http://www.pit-stop.com/clubs/c

lubs.html">Clubs</a> page or the background on the <a 
href="http://www.pit-stop.com/clubs/scca1.html">SCCA</a> page, both were originally done in Cadkey. I have done more, but they are not auto orientated so they don't quite fit in with this site. I'm also

 trying to learn VRML. <a href="http://www.cadkey.com">Cadkey</a>  has a pretty neat program in the beta phase that you can download free. It looks and feels like Cadkey 7.0 so, if you are familiar with Cadkey 7.0 you'll be right at home. You can even loa

d your .prt files into it. Also any other projects Pit-Stop may throw at me,  keep checking there often as it is always evolving. That's enough to keep me busy for awhile. Don't forget to E-Mail me if  I can do something for your buisness or hobbies.</lef

with adapters and all of the fittings. The pump has over three (3) times
the scavaging capability of the stock pump (420 gallons per hour vs 112.5

the oil &quot;backup&quot; or smoking problem usually associated with aftermarket
or Garrett conversions. <i>Perfect for twin turbo applications.</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Crankshaft Pulley for Crankfire Engine Management Systems : </b>Single
or double pulleys for street or track use. Made from 6061 alloy with a
spaceage coating which prolongs its life. All pulleys are available in
standard or small (race) diameter. Come complete with sensor holders and
distributor plug.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Clutch Adapters &amp; Spacers : </b>For 930, 935 and G-50 clutches.
Convert your cast iron clutch package into our aluminum units.</li>

the K-27 Turbo, and the bolts and spacers to move the coolant lines out
of the way.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>944 Turbo Idle Screws : </b>These idle screws <b><i>are no longer 
availble from Porsche. </i></b>Ours are an exact duplicate of the ones 
which originally came with the car.</li>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he UC SAREP Cover Crop Database includes over
5,000 items gleaned from more than 600 separate sources, including journal
articles, conference proceedings, standard textbooks, unpublished data,
and personal communications from researchers and farmers. The information
in the database concerns the management and effects of more than 32 species
of plants usable as cover crops. More than 400 different cover crop images
are also available for viewing online. The database was developed with
funding from USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program
(SARE), the State of California's Water Resources Control Board, and the
California Energy Commission.</P>

<P> 
The information presented here comes from diverse sources, which may vary
in reliability.  Some data are based on greenhouse studies, which may give
different results than the field.  Others are based on limited field
observations, sometimes only one year and one location. Still others are based
on personal observations, and are noted as such.  For details, see
the original articles (cited in the data base) that discuss the cover crop
in which you are interested.  We will update the database as more data
become available from ongoing research.</P>

<P>The report includes more than 40 summaries of research projects relating
to cover cropping. The summaries were compiled by former SAREP perennial
cropping systems analyst Chuck Ingels, chair of the UC Cover Crops Workgroup.
The workgroup, which includes 80 University of California personnel and
several individuals from outside the university, was created bring together
UC Cooperative Extension farm advisors and specialists, DANR faculty and
others to share information on cover cropping, determine the highest priority
research and extension needs, and coordinate activities to fulfill these
needs.</P>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>The use of cover crops continues to increase
as farmers seek to improve soil quality and reduce chemical inputs.
Research and grower experience have shown that cover crops can
provide multiple benefits related to soil protection, soil fertility,
groundwater quality and pest management. Choosing the right cover
crop is critical to successful cover cropping.</FONT></B></I>
<P>
Cover crops were frequently used on California farms in the first
half of this century, but were rarely grown after the 1950s, when
pesticides and fertilizers came into widespread use. In the last
decade, however, farmers and researchers have taken a renewed
interest in cover crops because of their potential role in reducing
chemical inputs and improving soil quality. Cover crops are now
recognized as an important component of &quot;sustainable&quot;
production in most areas of California.
<P>
Cover cropping can have both advantages and disadvantages (see
sidebar). Proper choice and management of cover crops
are important in maximizing the benefits and reducing potential
problems. To select a species or mix, the grower should first
determine the primary benefits he or she desires. Then consider
the specific conditions of the particular farming system, such
as soil type, water availability and method of irrigation, cropping
sequence and cultural practices. There may be only a few species
or many that are appropriate to a given farming system (<A HREF="SelectingCoverCropTable.html">see table
1</A>).
<H3>Adding and conserving nitrogen </H3>

<P>
A common reason for growing cover crops is to add nitrogen to
the soil using nitrogen-fixing legumes. Winter annual legumes
can fix 100 to 200 pounds of nitrogen per acre. Many growers use
a vetch, such as &quot;Lana&quot; woollypod vetch, to add the
greatest quantity of nitrogen. Summer annual legumes, such as
cowpea, typically add 100 to 130 pounds of nitrogen. However,
they can do so in 2 to 3 months, as compared to the 5- to 6-month
growing season for most winter annual cover crops.
<P>
When a legume cover crop is incorporated into the soil, a substantial
amount of nitrogen is usually mineralized (converted from organic
to plant-available forms) within a few weeks. Nitrogen continues
to mineralize in ensuing weeks as the organic matter decomposes.
In nontillage systems, cover crops are mowed and the residues
left on the soil surface. In such systems decomposition and nitrogen
availability will usually be delayed. Nitrogen availability may
also be reduced due to volatilization of nitrogen into the atmosphere
from decomposing residues. Little information is available regarding
such volatilization losses under California conditions; research
is needed to determine the magnitude of such losses and the factors
which affect them.
<IMG SRC = "../images/SelectingCoverCropCaption.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=302 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
<P>
Most nonlegumes do not fix nitrogen, but they can affect soil
nitrogen availability. Grasses can take up large quantities of
nitrogen from the soil, thereby reducing the potential for nitrate
leaching. Because of the high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of
grasses, their residues decompose slowly, and soil nitrogen availability
may be substantially decreased following their incorporation into
the soil. Several species in the mustard family and tansy phacelia
also take up nitrogen readily. Due to lower C/N ratios, however,
these species decompose and release their absorbed nitrogen into
the soil more rapidly than grasses (see <I>California Agriculture</I>,
September-October 1993).
<H3>Water use by cover crops </H3>

<P>
All cover crops require water for growth, but in most parts of
California winter cover crops have relatively little impact on
soil moisture. However, the earlier the cover crop is sown in
the fall or the longer it is allowed to grow in the spring, the
more water it will use. Summer annual cover crops use more water
than winter annuals and require irrigation. However, some species,
such as cowpea and hyacinth bean, are relatively drought tolerant
and can perform well with as little as two irrigations (J. Klein
and M. Van Horn, unpublished data).<BR>

<P>
In orchards and vineyards, summer-active cover crops (for example,
perennial clovers) compete directly with the cash crops for water.
A 4-year study of almonds grown in Merced and Stanislaus counties
showed that both resident vegetation and strawberry clover used
20 to 25% more water than a bare floor in a mature orchard (see
<I>California Agriculture</I>, July-August 1989). &quot;Blando&quot;
brome (soft chess) used more water than the bare floor treatment
during the spring. However, its clippings acted as a mulch, reducing
evaporation from the orchard floor in the summer and offsetting
earlier water use. Certain California native perennial grasses
are summer dormant and therefore use little or no water during
the summer, especially where drip irrigation is used. Some of
these grasses are being tested in vineyards and have potential
value in orchards as well. It is important to note that soil improvements
by cover crops may lead to more efficient use of water, especially
on sandy soils.
<H3>Pest management </H3>

<P>
Cover crops can also aid in pest management. For example, some
cover crops compete with and suppress weeds. Competitive cover
crop species include many perennials, such as strawberry clover,
and annuals with relatively large seeds and good seedling vigor,
such as cereal grasses, vetches and cowpea. Some other species,
such as annual clovers and small-seeded grasses, may not compete
well if left unmanaged, especially on very fertile soils. With
well-timed mowing or grazing, however, they regrow rapidly, often
more so than competing weeds.<BR>

<P>
Some cover crop species can become serious weeds if improperly
selected or managed. For example, most vetches produce substantial
viny growth, which can, if planted near tree or vine rows, overtake
grapevines or entwine sprinklers. Also, certain species, such
as cereal rye, produce tremendous amounts of biomass, which can
hinder mowing and disking. Other species, such as perennial clovers,
may invade tree or vine rows and resist herbicides; perennial
clovers also have a reputation for increasing gopher populations.
<P>
Hardseededness is a characteristic of certain cover crop species
that can help ensure self-regeneration of a cover crop stand.
Hard seeds have seed coats that are impermeable to water, ensuring
that a portion of the seed bank is held in reserve each year.
These seeds are viable, but will not germinate in the first year
after they mature. Thus, once a cover crop with hard seeds is
planted, it can be expected to reestablish itself with fall rains
each year, even in years when the previous cover crop did not
produce seed. Rose clovers produce high proportions of hard seed,
as do medics and some vetch species and subterranean clover varieties.
Self-regenerated stands are usually desirable in orchards and
vineyards, but these species may become problem weeds in annual
systems.
<P>
Cover crops in vineyards and orchards may provide food or shelter
to beneficial insects, mites and spiders. In citrus, for example,
the predatory mite <I>Euseius tularensis </I>is a key predator
of citrus thrips and various other pests. As Ouyang, Grafton-Cardwell
and Bugg observed in 1993, in the absence of prey, this predatory
mite can also subsist for a time on windblown pollens of grasses
commonly used as cover crops. Field trials are still needed to
determine whether grass cover crops lead to improved biological
control of the pests mentioned.<BR>

<P>
Cover crops such as soft chess, &quot;Salina&quot; strawberry
clover and resident vegetation speed up the decomposition of unharvested
almonds remaining on the orchard floor after harvest. Left intact,
these nuts would provide overwintering habitat for navel orangeworm.
Decomposition is aided by the moisture in cover crops and by flail
mowing, greatly decreasing spring emergence of the moths from
almonds (see <I>California Agriculture</I>, July-August 1989).
Navel orangeworm emergence from walnuts remaining in a tall winter
cover crop may not differ significantly from those remaining on
herbicide-treated soil (see <I>California Agriculture</I>, September-October
1993).<BR>

<P>
Some pest arthropod species are also associated with cover crops
and may require management. For example, two ant species pavement
ant and southern fire ant damage almonds by feeding on the kernels
of nuts that have been shaken to the ground. The ants are more
damaging in orchards cover cropped with soft chess, strawberry
clover and resident vegetation than in orchards treated with residual
herbicide (see <I>California Agriculture</I>, July-August 1989).
In cover-cropped orchards, prompt pickup of fallen nuts is important
to avoid problems with ants.<BR>

<P>
Some leguminous cover crops harbor abundant lygus bugs, which
are pests of some tree crops. However, studies in southern Georgia
by Bugg and others in 1990 suggest that subterranean clovers harbor
very few lygus bugs compared to vetches, medics and other clovers;
our own observations in California confirm this.
<H3>Cover crops in annual rotations </H3>

<P>
In annual cropping systems, cover crops are often chosen to maximize
benefits such as biomass and nitrogen production. However, other
factors must also be considered. For example, fitting a cover
crop into the sequence of a crop rotation can be difficult. Therefore,
fast-growing, drought-tolerant cover crops that require minimal
management are preferred. Cover crops with fast germination and
good seedling vigor are usually chosen because of their ability
to compete with weeds. Also, species with the potential to reduce
pest populations should be chosen, while those that harbor diseases
or arthropod pests of the cash crops should be avoided.<BR>

<P>
Common cool-season legumes used as cover crops in annual rotations
include vetches, winter pea and bell bean. Because clovers and
medics grow slower and compete poorly with weeds and require more
management (e.g., mowing), they are used less commonly in annual
rotations. For similar reasons, cereal grains are usually preferred
over other grass species, such as bromes, in annual rotations.
<BR>

<P>
In choosing warm- season cover crops, the ability to perform well
with minimal irrigation is often of primary consideration. Legume
species in this category include cowpea, hyacinth bean and sunnhemp.
Typical grass cover crops for warm conditions include sudangrass
and sorghum.
<H3>Self-reseeding cover crops </H3>

<P>
Many tree and vine crop growers prefer to use self-reseeding annual
cover crops. Using these species can reduce or eliminate the costs
associated with purchasing and sowing seed each year. Although
many of these species compete effectively with weeds if properly
managed, in some cases the reseeding cover may revert back to
resident vegetation within a few years. It may be necessary to
resow the cover crop in 3 to 5 years.
<P>
With some cover crops, self-reseeding can fail if insufficient
moisture is available in the spring to mature the seed for the
next year&iacute;s cover crop. This problem will most likely occur
if the row middles cannot be irrigated, such as when using drip
irrigation. In these situations, it may be wise to choose cover
crops that produce seed early in the spring and/or produce a relatively
high proportion of hard seed. Early-maturing varieties of crimson
clover, subterranean clover and burr medic are commercially available.

<H3>Conclusion </H3>

<P>
Successful cover cropping requires the selection of a species
or mix that will provide specific desired benefits and that will
be compatible with the overall farming system. Most growers who
use cover crops derive multiple benefits from them. In many situations,
a successful cover crop stand and the greatest benefits can be
obtained by using mixtures of species, such as grasses and legumes.
Furthermore, as with cash crops, cover crops should be rotated
periodically to avoid the buildup of plant-specific pests. 
<P>
Cover cropping, like any new practice, should be approached slowly
and methodically. It may be valuable to test several species or
mixtures to find the most appropriate cover crop. It is usually
a good idea to begin on a small scale in order to learn from mistakes
without incurring unnecessary expenses. With persistence and creativity,
cover cropping can provide many benefits with little or no extra
cost.<BR>

<P>
San Joaquin Valley growers have several cover cropping systems
from which to choose.  The choice and performance of cover crops
often depends on site-specific factors, so they should first be
tested in a few rows before planting large acreages.  The main
factors to consider when selecting a particular species or mix
are costs vs. benefits, irrigation method, tillage practices,
nitrogen needs, frost concerns and harvesting practices (for nut
crops).  Understanding the basic cover crop types and management
strategies can greatly improve the chances for success.
<H3>COVER CROP SPECIES AND BLENDS</H3>

<P>
Monocultures of sown cover crops are frequently used, but problems
may occur with the use of the same species year after year. For
example, continual plantings of Cahaba white vetch may be affected
by soil diseases; also, in some areas alfalfa weevil can be a
serious pest of bur medic.  Localized environmental niches, such
as sand streaks or areas with differing soil nutrient availability,
may also provide unfavorable growing conditions for a single species.
 Providing different species in a mix may enable one species to
thrive in areas where another might be weak, increasing the chances
for a healthy stand throughout the orchard or vineyard.  Polycultures
also attract a diversity of beneficial arthropods which may aid
in pest management, although research in this area has provided
mixed results.
<P>
<B>Resident vegetation</B> is naturally-occurring vegetation,
or &quot;weeds.&quot;  While not sown, this ground cover is inexpensive
to manage and has some of the benefits of sown cover crops, such
as providing traction, improving soil tilth, and attracting some
beneficial insects.  However, resident vegetation can be highly
variable among farms and even within a single orchard or vineyard.
 It usually contains little or no nitrogen-contributing legumes,
which are essential on organic farms.  Also, it can contain undesirable
weeds which may compete excessively with the trees or vines. 
Of course, many growers use resident vegetation successfully.
<P>
<B>Reseeding Winter Annual Cover Crops.</B> With the increasing
trend towards nontillage, many growers sow winter annual species
that reseed and die in the spring and regenerate each fall--preferably
with irrigation, but often with rainfall alone.  Such species
include clovers, medics, many vetches, oats, barley, 'Blando'
brome, and 'Zorro' fescue.  Species that do not effectively reseed
include bell (fava) beans and field peas.  In addition, many species
will only reliably reseed if supplemental irrigation water is
supplied in the spring.  Blends of burr medic (burr clover) and
subterranean, crimson, and rose clovers are common and can be
quite productive when properly maintained.  Where no supplemental
irrigation is available (i.e., under drip irrigation), the following
species that will reseed in most years: burr medic, early and
mid-season varieties of subterranean clover, rose clover, 'Blando'
brome (soft chess), and 'Zorro' fescue.  If not replanted or if
neglected, however, in time these species may simply become minor
components of the ground cover.  Periodic replanting every 3 to
4 years can ensure dominance by these species.
<P>
Burr medic is well adapted to California's climate and grows well
only in neutral to high-pH soils; it is occasionally a major component
of resident vegetation.  It effectively reseeds even under fairly
close mowing and, because of its high percentage of hard seed,
it usually reestablishes well even when tillage is used.  For
these reasons, it is an excellent cover crop for raisin vineyards.
 Burrless varieties, such as 'Santiago,' are available commercially.
 Subterranean clover, or subclover, usually performs best in acid
to neutral soils.  It forms a dense, spreading mat which can effectively
suppress weed growth, especially with periodic mowing.  Early-maturing
varieties, frequently used on range land, include 'Nungarin' and
'Dalkeith.'  'Blando' brome is often used in monocultural stands,
although it is useful as a low-growing, mowable grass when combined
with clovers and medics.  'Zorro' fescue is very expensive and
is used mostly on hillside, serpentine, low fertility soils or
where initial erosion control is required on cleared land.
<P>
<B>High Biomass Mixes.</B>  Where supplemental irrigation is available,
mixes which produce large amounts of biomass, or plant matter,
can be used to add organic matter to the soil.  The periodic addition
of organic matter enhances soil microbial populations, improving
soil structure and nutrient cycling.  High biomass mixes contain
large seeds and are usually quite easy to grow.  In general, they
are sown each fall and either disked or mowed in the spring. 
Two basic types of high biomass mixes are often available from
seed companies: pure legume and legume/grass blends.
<P>
Pure legume blends, usually containing bell beans, vetch, and
field peas are used to add the maximum amount of readily available
nitrogen to the soil.  They are usually disked in late March or
April during peak flowering; this is referred to as a &quot;green
manure&quot; cover crop.  Where furrow irrigation is used, they
are disked before the soil dries excessively to enable the disk
to penetrate the soil.  Bell beans produce vigorous, upright growth.
 Field peas are shallow rooted and therefore subject to drought
on sandy soils; they also produce the far majority of their biomass
and nitrogen in the spring.  Vetches are frequently used, but
may twine up vines, trees, or sprinklers if planted too close.
 Also, if allowed to reseed they may become a weed problem in
the rows.  Among the vetches, purple vetch usually produces the
greatest amount of biomass by late winter/early spring, but it
is also the least winter hardy.  When maximum biomass production
is desired before disking in March, purple vetch is may be the
best vetch species to use in most areas of California, although
mixing vetches is also advantageous.  'Lana' woollypod is one
of the most vigorous vetches in the spring and flowers and matures
earlier than purple vetch.  Common vetch has extrafloral nectaries
on the stipules, which provide nectar to beneficial insects. 
Cahaba white vetch has been shown to suppress root knot nematodes.
<P>
Various legume/grass blends are also available.  The addition
of grasses, such as barley, oats, or cereal rye in a mix imparts
several benefits.  The fibrous roots of grasses greatly enhance
soil tilth and water penetration.  Grasses also take up excess
nitrogen from the soil, improving the growth and nitrogen-fixing
ability of the legumes.  Lastly, grasses provide structural support
for the twining vetches and peas.  Legume/grass cover crop blends
can be disked, but are often simply mowed; the clippings form
a moisture-conserving mulch through much of the growing season.
 Typical blends often consist of bell beans, one or more vetches,
peas, and oats.  Because bell beans and peas do not tolerate mowing,
they are sometimes omitted; barley/vetch or oat/vetch blends are
relatively inexpensive and are used in many orchards and vineyards.
<P>
<B>Perennials.</B>  Perennial grasses and legumes provide a permanent
cover that offers year-round traction and ease of management.
 Perennial clovers, such as white and strawberry, are low growing
and add nitrogen, but are invasive and compete with trees and
vines for water.  Birdsfoot trefoil, a legume, is slow to establish
but forms a low-growing, dense cover.  Vigorous, summer-active
perennial grasses, such as 'Berber' orchardgrass and tall fescue,
devigorate trees and vines and should only be planted where vigor
is excessive.
<P>
Drought tolerant and drought avoidant perennial grasses, most
of which are native to California, are currently popular among
many grape growers, especially in the North Coast and the San
Joaquin delta area.  Drought tolerant species survive dry periods
by developing large root-to-shoot ratios--i.e., extensive, spreading
root systems.  Drought avoidant species, such as meadow barley
and California brome, deal with dry periods by going dormant when
water is scarce, and are most appropriate under drip irrigation.
 While both types can be useful, the latter species are the most
appropriate in order to avoid excessive competition with vines.
 Under drip irrigation they will almost completely shut down growth
during the summer, and thus will not compete with the vines. 
The seed is quite expensive initially, but can be relatively inexpensive
over the life of the cover.  It is important to select species
that are adapted to the climate.  Special care must be used in
planting and establishment of these species, but once established
they often effectively outcompete weeds.  Low-growing mixes are
available that require only one mowing per year; in any case,
springtime mowing of these grasses should be avoided until after
seed has matured.
<P>
<B>Insectary Blends.</B>  Many cover crop blends are available
which are sown for the purpose of attracting beneficial insects.
 These mixes vary greatly among seed companies, but usually include
members of the carrot and sunflower families.  Insectary blends
are usually sown in the fall every 3 to 10 rows and treated as
perennials; they are allowed to flower and reseed in order to
be effective and to persist.  While insectary blends do attract
a diversity of predators and parasitoids, their role in pest management
is unclear.  Some growers have encountered problems with these
blends, usually arising from poor establishment from planting
too deeply (they should be only about 1/4 in. deep).  Summer annual
insectary species, such as buckwheat, are occasionally planted
in orchards and vineyards.
<H3>MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERATIONS</H3>

<P>
<B>Planting.</B>  Winter annual and perennial cover crops perform
best when sown by mid-October, but can also be successfully grown
if planted by mid-November.  It should be noted that establishing
small-seeded cover crops in years with little fall rains may be
very difficult, especially on sandy soils.  In general, lower
rates can be used for early seeding, and higher rates should be
used for later seeding.  For example, vetch sown in late September
or early October may be seeded at 30 to 40 pounds per acre, while
an early November seeding would require 40-80 lbs.  Good seedbed
preparation is essential, especially with native grasses.  Legume
seeds must be inoculated with nitrogen-fixing <I>Rhizobium</I>
bacteria to ensure nitrogen fixation.  Small-seeded legumes are
usually preinoculated, however large-seeded legumes (bell beans,
vetch, and peas) must be inoculated by the grower, at least the
first time they are sown.  Use about one 8-ounce bag of inoculant
per 100 pounds of seed.  The most reliable method is the &quot;wet&quot;
method, where a slurry of inoculum and adhesive are added to the
seed and then allowed to dry before planting.  However, the inoculant
can also simply be layered (dry) with seed in the hopper.  Inoculant
or inoculated seed should be kept out of direct sunlight, so broadcast
seed should be incorporated as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mowing.</B>  Because cover crops can increase frost hazard,
they are often mowed in late winter.  Bell beans and peas do not
perform well if mowed.  Vetch should be mowed high (no lower than
8-10 in.), but must not be mowed after about late March if reseeding
is desired.  High biomass blends can be killed in spring if mowed
close to the ground.  Nontillage clover mixes should be mowed
in late winter to suppress tall weeds and encourage spreading.
 Subclover and burr medic can usually reseed even under fairly
close mowing, while crimson and rose clovers flower above the
foliage and therefore must not be mowed after about late March
to allow for reseeding.  
<P>
<B>Nutrition.</B>  As with trees and vines, soil fertility is
critical to cover crop production.  Legumes fix nitrogen, so nitrogen
should not be applied shortly before or during their growth. 
However, legumes do require adequate sulfur (which is plentiful
in most vineyards) and phosphorus for good growth.  Annual grasses
require nitrogen additions if grown alone, and will respond well
to up to 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre.  Perennial grasses may
require even more than this amount.  In general, grasses predominate
on highly fertile sites, while legumes will usually grow best
in soils with low nitrogen content.  Many poor solid legume plantings
(especially clovers and medics) that are overtaken by grasses
and mustards may be a result of excessive soil nitrogen, so broadcast
fertilization should be avoided from fall until late spring. 
The end result of cover cropping should be optimum crop nutrition
and productivity, so tissue nutrient analyses should be conducted
regularly.
<P>
In general, vetches and peas can fix far more nitrogen than clovers
and medics.  A green manure cover crop disked in April can add
150 pounds or more of nitrogen per planted acre, which may cause
excessive vigor in grapevines,  especially on highly fertile soils.
 Nitrogen production in orchards may be reduced due to shading
and the use of wide herbicide strips.  Management options in vigorous
vineyards include alternate row planting, perhaps with native
perennial grasses in alternating rows, and mowing instead of disking.
 When residues are mowed and left on the soil surface, a portion
of the nitrogen will volatilize into the atmosphere.  With about
80 percent of the nitrogen in leguminous cover crops contained
in the above-ground portion, volatilization losses can be high--perhaps
as much as half.  Nontillage clovers and medics may add only about
30 to 40 pounds of nitrogen per planted acre.  Perennial clovers
may add substantial amounts of nitrogen, while perennial grasses
use soil nitrogen and may require supplemental fertilization.
<P>
<B>Cover Cropping in Almond and Walnut Orchards.</B>  Because
almonds and walnuts are harvested picked up from the orchard floor,
excessive cover crop debris at harvest could be problematic, particularly
in nontilled orchards.  However, most winter annual cover crops
can be grown successfully if properly managed.  Legume cover crops
have a low carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio and therefore break
down fairly rapidly after mowing, usually causing no residue problems
at harvest.  Grass residues have a high C/N ratio and can persist
until harvest, but they are usually not a problem if mowed closely
by June, followed by periodic mowing until harvest.  Under drip
or microsprinkler irrigation, breakdown of residues is slower,
so mowing should start in late spring.

<B>Soil Ecology: Understanding and Preserving Soil Systems</B><BR>
The 1997 Soil Ecology Society Conference will be held on the campus of Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, from May 27-30, 1997. The meeting will begin Tuesday evening, May 27, with a keynote lecture and welcoming reception, and will end Friday, May 30.  The theme of the Conference (Soil Ecology: Understanding and Preserving Soil Systems) is designed to embrace current perspectives in soil ecology and highlight new advances in understanding the structure and function of belowground systems, with emphasis on the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and the role of soil ecology in ecosystem management. The program will include contributed oral presentations organized around session topics, afternoon contributed poster sessions, and opportunities for informal group discussions. Tentative session topics include: effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on soil biota and/or soil processes; soil food web dynamics; plant-microbial interactions; biogeochemical studies; rhizosphere ecology; and invertebrate-microbial interactions.  Special events will include a field trip and evening barbeque at the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, a 3,500 ha tallgrass prairie preserve which is the focus for the grasslands ecology program at KSU. Additional local field trips will be arranged.  Registration materials will be mailed to all current SES members in November 1996.  Additional information and meeting updates can be found at <br>

<H1><I>From the Director- </I><BR>Two Experts Welcome Chaos
</H1>

<P>
<I>&quot;Chaos defines my farm.  I allow natural grasses to go
wild.  I see new six-legged creatures migrating into my fields,
which now look like green pastures.  I watch with paranoid panic,
wanting to believe all will be fine while terrified I may lose
the crop and even the farm.  I need a lesson on managing chaos.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>- David Mas Masumoto, in Epitaph for a Peach (Harper Collins,
1995)</I>
<P>
California farmers like <B>Mas Masumoto</B> are vividly aware
of the issues that <B>Tom Peters </B>addressed in his book, <I>Thriving
on Chaos (Knopf, 1987)</I>:  international competition, accelerating
technology, changing consumer tastes and other forces demand flexible
management like never before.  Peters advocates that we learn
to <I>thrive</I> <I>on</I> chaos rather than merely learn to cope
with it:  &quot;the winners of tomorrow will deal <I>proactively</I>
with chaos, will look at the chaos as a source of market advantage,
not as a problem to be gotten around.&quot;
<P>

<P>
Enhancing our sustainability in agriculture is, in many ways,
an attempt to build in flexibility that works with, rather than
resists, rapid change.  Two exciting new projects, funded under
our Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) program (see
p. 10), illustrate this approach.  They look for ways to enhance
the buffering that occurs in biologicallybased systems, rather
than merely treating immediate problems and symptoms.   They are
based upon participatory teams, in which the farmers, scientists
and consultants are equal partners in research and education,very
similar to Peter' concept of selfmanaging teams.  
<P>
In his more recent book, <I>The Pursuit of WOW! (Random House,
1994)</I>,  Peters responds to criticisms of selfmanaging teams.
 &quot;Experts say the shift to selfmanaged teams takes years
of training and preparation.  Really?  Whats a family but a selfmanaged
team?&quot;  Perhaps that similarity is why Masumoto's book, subtitled
<I>Four Seasons on My Family Farm</I>, is such an enjoyable illustration
of many of Peters' management themes. For example, Masumoto's
description of his efforts to instruct his pruning crew, only
to admit that &quot;These men have pruned more than I have...so
now we exchange a few comments, they nod, and then they disregard
my model,&quot; demonstrates perfectly Peters' maxims about the
value of supervisors empowering frontline workers.
<P>
As Masumoto notes, &quot;Most good farmers I know are ... tending
to their trees and vines as best they can, comfortable with their
work, and confident that the final product will be fine.  Whether
they know it or not, seasoned farmers are already experts at chaos.&quot;
<P>
Those of us who work for the University of California or other
public or private organizations that support the agricultural
community may take comfort in the fact both an internationally
respected management expert and a successful farmer agree it is
not possible or always desirable to have all the answers.   Masumoto
and Peters, unlikely soul mates, know from experience it may be
better to have a flexible system of management in place so that
the vagaries of life and land can be received with enthusiasm.

<H1>Farming Practices Survey</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff2.html">Jill Shore Auburn</A>, UC SAREP</I>
<P>
Since 1992, participants at most educational meetings sponsored
by UC SAREP have been surveyed about their farming practices and
experiences.  Many of the questions are similar or identical to
those asked in 1990 by <B>Jim Grieshop</B> and <B>Arnaz Raj</B>,
reported in <I>California Agriculture</I>, 46(2):4-7 (March/April
1992).  The results reported here are from 374 responses received
at 18 meetings in 1992 through 1994.  The meetings addressed diverse
commodities (e.g. apples, rice, vegetables, grapes, cotton) and
topics (e.g. cover cropping, wildlife enhancement) and were held
all over the state by UC farm advisors, private non-profit organizations,
and others. Due to this diversity from meeting to meeting and
year to year, results are reported here for all three years combined
rather than separately for each year, since year-to-year differences
may be a result of changing topics and audiences as much as changing
times.  As with Grieshop and Raj's earlier study, the results
should not be interpreted as representative of the state's farming
population as a whole, since respondents are self-selected as
a result of attending a meeting and returning a survey.  Nevertheless,
they show some interesting patterns.
<P>
Survey respondents were primarily farmers (55 percent) farm managers
(22 percent), or pest control advisors or other consultants (17
percent).  A small number were farm suppliers (4 percent) or UC
farm advisors (1 percent).  Twelve percent were &quot;other&quot;
such as students or educators.  (Respondents checked all that
applied, so percentages add to more than 100 percent.)  The average
number of acres farmed (or managed or consulted upon) was nearly
2,000.  Most respondents were male (88 percent) and non-Hispanic
White (84 percent);  7 percent were Hispanic, 6 percent of Asian/Pacific
Island heritage, and 1 percent each Black, Native American and
&quot;Other.&quot;
<P>
When asked about specific production and marketing practices,
many respondents reported substantial use of many tactics that
are often associated with sustainable agriculture.  (See Table
1).

<P>
In addition, one-fifth or more of respondents planned to: use
compost (purchased or produced on-farm); provide most nutrients
from cover crop, compost, or manure; reduce tillage; release beneficials;
use pheromones; use microbial pesticides; improve habitat for
predators; and avoid synthetic pesticides.
<P>
We asked people to place themselves on Grieshop and Raj's seven-point
continuum between &quot;High Conventional&quot; and &quot;High
Ecological&quot; where <I>High Conventional</I> was defined as
&quot; the effective use of new and traditional technologies and
practices, chemicals, and natural resources; centralized arrangements
and agricultural practices for effective management and production;
and primary reliance on resources and practices that maintain
desired level of production.&quot;  <I>High Ecological</I> was
defined as &quot;high concern for environment; very judicious
use of inputs; minimal reliance on man-made resources; reduced
use of chemicals; and increased conservation of soil, water, and
energy.&quot;  People were asked to place a mark on this scale
for three points in time:  today, five years ago, and five years
from now.  The average response was somewhat toward ecological
for &quot;today&quot; (3.3 where 1=High Ecological and 7=High
Conventional), versus somewhat toward conventional for &quot;five
years ago&quot; (4.9).  Approximately two-thirds predicted future
change toward the ecological end of the continuum in the next
five years; nearly all the remaining third predicted no future
change, rather than a change toward conventional.  The average
future score predicted was 2.3.
<P>
Whether they had moved left or right on the continuum, we asked
respondents to describe the effects on their farms.  Results are
reported for two contrasting groups of respondents:  1) those
that reported no previous change on the continuum, or a change
toward conventional (n=97, &quot;more conventional&quot;), and
2) those that reported more than average change (more than 1.5
points) toward ecological (n=149, &quot;more ecological&quot;).

<P>
The results reported by the two groups are more striking for their
similarities than their differences (Table 2): yields have most
often held steady or increased and production costs have most
often increased, for both groups.  The distributions of experiences
for net profits are also similar for the two groups, as are the
results for disease, nematode, and weed problems.  Those who had
shifted more toward ecological management reported more decreases
in insect problems, and more increases in labor needs.  Management
complexity and risk rose for both groups, but so did personal
satisfaction from farming.
<P>
These figures report perceived results on a qualitative scale,
rather than actual field measurements of the effects of farming
practices.  
<P>
According to this survey, those farmers who have switched to a
more ecological system compare favorably to those using conventional
systems.

<H1>USDA Sustainable Agriculture Professional Development Program
</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff6.html">David Chaney</A>, UC SAREP</I>
<P>
A new USDA program for professional education in sustainable agriculture
was initiated in 1994.  Funding was made available under the 1990
Farm Bill (Title XVI, Subtitle B, Chapter 3) for each state to
develop a statewide strategic plan for professional development,
targeting Cooperative Extension (CE) advisors, Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) field staff, and other agricultural
consultants (see &quot;Western Sustainable Ag Training Program
Underway,&quot;  Sustainable Agriculture, Vol. 7, No. 1).  SAREP
coordinated this activity in California.
<P>
Our planning process centered around three focus groups, which
took place in November and December of 1994 in Merced, Riverside
and Davis.  The purposes of these meetings were to better define
the educational needs and interests of the target audiences, and
identify the methods and strategies that would be most successful
in meeting those needs.  More than 60 individuals participated
in the focus groups including CE advisors and county directors
from each of CE's four regions, NRCS field staff,  farmers, and
representatives of several UC programs, government agencies and
non-profit organizations involved in sustainable agriculture education.
<P>
Since the target audiences for the Chapter 3 program are initially
CE and the NRCS, the participation of advisors and field staff
from these organizations was especially important.  The plan builds
on the considerable expertise and ongoing work of California's
CE and NRCS personnel in extending information about sustainable
agriculture, and aims to enhance their work with farms, ranches
and communities across the state.
<P>
Much of the discussion that took place during the planning meetings
focused on enriching the educational efforts that are already
underway and strengthening the programs of the many organizations
and groups in California involved in sustainable agriculture education.
 In summary, the planning groups recommended a three-part approach
that:
<UL>
<LI>builds on existing educational programs 
<LI>provides focused programs and farm tours on high priority
topics and issues
<LI>strengthens extension teams and networks addressing related
problems and issues.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These components and the assessment of educational needs and interests
of the target audiences are described in detail in the planning
document which is available from SAREP. With the completion of
this plan and its submission to the Western Region USDA-SARE program,
individuals or groups from California will be better positioned
to compete for funds that will help enrich educational and professional
development activities.

<H1><U><I>RCDs</I></U> Total Resource Management Outreach</H1>

<P>
<I>by Stephanie McGovern, California Association of Resource Conservation
Districts</I>
<P>
In January of 1994, the California Association of Resource Conservation
Districts received a $1.7 million Challenge Grant from the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation to perform a three-year Total Resource Management
Outreach Project.  This ongoing project, called Farmers for Agricultural
Resource Management (FARM), combines aspects of on-farm management
at approximately 30 demonstration farms in five regions throughout
California.  A site manager has been chosen in each region to
oversee the farms in the  area.  Some of the resources that will
be integrated include agronomy, biology, drainage, energy, water
and farm management.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate
total resource management on farms and to disseminate the results
to California farmers and their non-agricultural neighbors.
<P>
Growers who practice TRM consider the connectivity of resources
and their impacts on many aspects of the farming operation.  These
total resource managers put seemingly external factors such as
soil health, biodiversity, ecology, air quality and water quality
on a similar priority as more direct aspects of farm profitability
such as pest management costs, crop yield and crop quality.  Total
resource managers tend to examine the far reaching cause and effect
of different farming practices, and therefore often exhibit somewhat
of an experimental approach to parts of the farming operation.
<P>
&quot;This project is allowing farmers to test innovative practices
and document what works and what doesn't.  The grant helps pay
for a team of specialists who analyze the innovations and reduce
the risk to the grower's livelihood.  These pioneer farmers are
building a future model that encourages others to use sustainable
and environmentally friendly farming practices,&quot; says <B>Julie
Spezia</B>,  executive director, California Association of Resource
Conservation Districts.
<P>
The demonstration activities are designed to consider many different
aspects of resource management through an iterative process of
assessment, recommendation, implementation and evaluation.  The
cooperating districts were given flexibility to recruit growers
and design their specific project approach within the given broad
guidelines.  Below is a summary of each district's activities:
<H3>Cachuma Resource Conservation District (CRCD)</H3>

<P>
The CRCD, located in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties,
is the most recent cooperator to join the FARM Project.  The RCD
encompasses a service area of almost two million acres in San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Kern counties.  The region is extremely
diverse in climate, topography, agriculture, recreational opportunities
and socioeconomic structure. 
<P>
 
<P>
This diversity is best reflected in five major ecological zones.
 These zones range from arid regions in the interior through the
mountains and foothills, to a Mediterranean-like climate in the
coastal regions.  Topography ranges from sea level to 6,828 feet.
 Precipitation is largely in the form of rain, but snowfall is
common at the higher elevations.  Rainfall ranges from five inches
in Cuyama Valley to over 40 inches in the mountains.  The diversity
in growing conditions supports a wide range of crops and horticultural
products.  Major crops include avocados, lemons, strawberries,
winegrapes, apples, broccoli, lettuce, cauliflower, carrots, beans,
flower and vegetable seed and cut flowers.  All of the major crops
are irrigated.  Collectively there are about 125,000 acres of
irrigated cropland.
<P>
In the CRCD service area the most critical resource issues are
water quality and quantity, soil erosion and the resultant sedimentation,
and urban/agricultural interface problems.  In addressing these
concerns there are numerous environmental and human resource issues
which must also be considered.  Sensitive plants, animals, and
their habitats must be taken into account, and farm management
practices must be closely monitored for their effect on air and
water quality.
<P>
The CRCD has an existing Mobile Lab team which provides traditional
hydraulic evaluations and scheduling assistance for irrigators.
 It has also developed a software program which enables growers
to automate irrigation scheduling.  In addition, the team also
includes an analysis of certain chemical properties in the water
source, and recommends management changes when they are required.
 The CRCD will soon start a joint venture project with the UC
Cooperative Extension to measure nitrate-nitrogen bound in organic
material incorporated into the soil under intensive farming conditions.
  The CRCD also maintains one of the most effective soil erosion
control programs in the state.  
<H3>Kings River Conservation District (KRCD)</H3>

<P>
There is nothing in the world quite like the Kings River.  The
magnificent mountain country in which the river begins is among
the Earth's most rugged and spectacular.  What water from the
Kings has created on the land is equally remarkable, a garden
of nearly 1.1 million acres which today is one of the most fertile
and productive agricultural regions in the world.  It is a living
lesson in the value of water in a land of little rain.  No resource
is more precious to the hundreds of thousands of people who live
and work in portions of Fresno, Kings and Tulare counties watered
by the Kings.
<P>
Today faced with enormous population growth and increased environmental
concerns, entirely new challenges are confronting the Kings River's
diverse interests.   KRCD is striving to integrate all of the
target resources on its demonstration farms.  To date, it has
extended the greatest effort in water management, energy management,
agronomy, integrated pest management, and biology.
<P>
&quot;The goal of the project is to demonstrate and publicize
solutions to farming problems that are practical, economical and
healthy to the environment and farming over the long haul,&quot;
says <B>John Weddington</B>, KRCD's project manager.  
<P>
KRCD is currently working with four family-owned farms that range
in size from 28 to several hundred acres and include table grapes,
citrus, almonds and stonefruits.  The growers were chosen based
on their interest in the objectives of the program and their seemingly
progressive natures.  All four cooperating growers aspire to reduce
dependence on fossil fuel and agricultural chemicals, but approach
their aspirations in different ways.  Some of the practices implemented
to date include irrigation scheduling, pump rehabilitation, cover
crops, IPM monitoring and releases, and installation of owl boxes.
<H3>Pond Shafter Wasco Resource Conservation District (PSWRCD)
</H3>

<P>
The PSWRCD is notable for its successful Mobile Irrigation Laboratory
program, which has been providing irrigation management support
to growers in Kern County for several years.  More recently Kern
County growers have been confronted with reduced water supplies,
increased water prices and intense pressure from regulatory agencies
to alter chemical use and avoid impacts to endangered species
habitat.  Because many farming changes have been thrust upon area
growers, PSWRCD has advanced delicately in its pursuit of integrated
resource management by focusing on the growers' primary resource
concerns and constantly looking for opportunities to introduce
other technologies.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="images/water.gif" ALT="Irrigation water image">
</CENTER>
<P>

&quot;We want to look at all aspects of farming and offer our
growers some expert recommendations on how to improve the overall
efficiency of their farm,&quot; says <B>Brian Hockett</B>, PSWRCD's
project manager.
<P>
The almond producers in the PSWRCD program include a 300 acre
family farm, a 2,100 acre partnership and a 15,000 acre corporation.
 Each of the four sites has a different irrigation method, including
two types of micro-sprinklers, border strip and undertree impact
sprinklers.  
<P>
Over the three-year time span, workshops will be held for other
farmers to learn results from the study.  A public outreach program
will also be implemented in order to inform urban residents of
the value of maximizing resources in agriculture.
<H3>West Stanislaus Resource Conservation District (WSRCD)</H3>

<P>
The West Stanislaus RCD and its cooperators on over 30 farms are
incorporating ways to support and improve California's Central
Valley.  Irrigation of this area has transformed the environment
of a once semi-arid valley into a thriving agricultural garden.
<P>
&quot;Water not only enables growers to cultivate many crops,
it also supports the economy of many agriculture-related industries
and provides the general population with an abundance of economical,
high quality food and fiber,&quot; states<B> Keith Azevedo</B>,
project manager from the WSRCD.
<P>
Unfortunately, the primary source of sediment reaching the San
Joaquin River comes from eroded soil on furrow irrigated cropland.
 Much of this sediment comes from the West Stanislaus Area.  Often
this sediment is polluted with agricultural chemicals that could
impair domestic, industrial, recreation and fish and wildlife
water uses.  The contaminated water can be toxic to animals and
humans alike.  Based on 16 years of past efforts, the focus of
the WSRCD has been to improve the quality of surface runoff entering
the San Joaquin River.
<P>
Given the reduced availability of water, mandates to reduce nutrient
and pesticide use, urban expansion into agricultural areas and
interest to improve wildlife habitat, the WSRCD and many cooperators
will demonstrate new techniques of using existing practices to
manage water, energy, chemical and biological resources within
a profitable farm setting.
<H3>Yolo County Resource Conservation District (YCRCD)</H3>

<P>
The YCRCD has been active for several years in a variety of projects,
the most notable of which involve increasing levels of biodiversity
in agricultural settings.  Its cooperators have introduced native
grasses to roadsides, field edges and canal banks, which also
serve as habitat for beneficial insects.  They have installed
irrigation and runoff detention ponds which provide plant and
animal habitat, and they have helped introduce new rice production
practices that increase waterfowl habitat and reduce agricultural
burning. 
<P>
The primary focus of YCRD's program is the integration of resources,
with special attention being paid to biological and farm management
resources.  The influence of previous efforts to increase biodiversity
are evident in many of the practices that are being considered
such as cover crops, tailwater ponds and release of beneficial
insects.
<P>
&quot;We are trying to show growers how to handle a wide range
of conservation questions rather than simply addressing water
or erosion,&quot; says <B>Rich Engel</B>, YCRCD's project manager.
 &quot;Our model farm program will show producers how they can
set up their practices to preserve all resources like soils, energy,
water and air while farming their operations efficiently,  reducing
pesticide use and preserving wildlife habitat.&quot;
<P>
In addition to their current work on demonstration farms, the
YCRCD FARM team is also focusing on developing an integrated resource
method that will outlive the current FARM project.  By refining
the NRCS model for local conditions, the District is attempting
to develop a streamlined way of assessing, recommending, implementing
and reassessing sustainable agricultural practices.
<P>
The seven selected farms include a vineyard, walnut orchard, hay
operation (alfalfa and oats), two cattle operations and two field
crop operations (tomatoes, wheat, corn, etc.).  Farm sizes range
from a relatively small orchard to 9,000 acres of rangeland. 
In addition to the wide variety of crops, the selected growers
also represent a variety of farming approaches, from fairly conventional
to a grower that is considering conversion to organic status.
<P>
&quot;We will not be looking strictly at the management of conventional
resources, but at the attitude of the farmer and whether he or
she is inclined to continue to risk capital on these practices
after the program ends.  There is a lot of pressure on farmers
to have fields that look good to their neighbors.  We'll be asking
how these growers feel about seeing a few weeds out there,&quot;
Engel says.
<P>

<H1>SAREP Awards BIFS Grants to San Joaquin Valley Growers, Scientists
</H1>

<P>
<I>by <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff8.html">Lyra Halprin</A>, UC SAREP</I>
<P>
San Joaquin Valley winegrape and row crop growers are teaming
up with University of California scientists in two pilot projects
to showcase innovative farming practices that reduce pesticide
use and improve soil quality.
<P>
The Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission (LWWC) and a group of
farmers and researchers in the San Joaquin Valley's Westside have
each been awarded money to demonstrate &quot;biologically integrated
farming systems&quot; (BIFS) on local farms and share that information
with other growers.  The Commission has been allocated $100,000
to use local vineyards as &quot;classrooms&quot; for area growers
and to sponsor educational meetings on innovative farming practices.
 The Westside group has been awarded $86,000 to conduct row crop
comparison studies and to share information on biologically integrated
farming practices with district growers.   Authorization for the
projects comes from the Legislature's Assembly Bill 3383, which
was signed into law last year.  Funding for the awards is provided
jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California
Department of Pesticide Regulation. The program is administered
by UC SAREP.
<P>
&quot;We are delighted to award these grants to two voluntary
researcher-farmer groups who have come together to deal with common
agricultural problems and reduce pesticide use,&quot; said UC
SAREP Director <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff1.html">Bill Liebhardt</A></B>.  &quot;Other projects similar
to BIFS have shown us that using a team approach coupling innovative
farmers with scientists is much more effective than regulations
in helping other growers adopt biologically integrated farming
practices.&quot;
<H3>Maintain Yields</H3>

<P>
These farmers are integrating biological and cultural control
of pests into their production systems; providing on-farm habitats
for beneficial insects, mites and spiders; and emphasizing soil-building
practices such as cover crops to provide all or part of the nitrogen
needed by crops.  The intended result, according to Liebhardt,
is that biologically integrated farming systems will enable farmers
to maintain yields and quality while greatly reducing their reliance
on agrichemicals, including pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.

<P>
BIFS is designed around a team approach to farm management, using
farmers, consultants, University of California farm advisors and
researchers, and independent pest-control advisers.  Both projects
use successful working farms to demonstrate agricultural operations
that have reduced pesticide use in high-value crops. Other area
farmers have agreed to participate by adapting the methods demonstrated
to sections of their own farms and then monitoring and comparing
results with &quot;conventional&quot; plots.
<H3>Cooperative Venture</H3>

<P>
&quot;The model of participatory extension and research in our
project is based on the premise that useful outcomes occur when
parties share goals and opportunities,&quot; said<B> Jeff Mitchell</B>,
a UC Cooperative Extension vegetable crops specialist and project
leader on the Westside project. &quot;The 13 farmer members of
our group are enthusiastic about this program because they want
workable alternatives to pesticides and methods to improve soil
quality, and they feel that UC researchers bring credibility to
the on-farm demonstrations.  Our researchers feel that they will
benefit from direct involvement with farmers, which will allow
them to develop new and relevant problem-solving research opportunities.&quot;
<P>
<B>Mark Chandler</B>, the LWWC executive director and administrator
of the Commission's BIFS grant, notes that the Lodi-area coalition
of researchers and farmers is excited to be involved in a project
that will expand integrated pest management practices.  &quot;Conventional
agriculture is looking for that 'shining example' of a district-wide,
commodity-based IPM program that demonstrates 'how it's done,'&quot;
he said.  &quot;With this grant we hope to be that example.&quot;
<P>
 The winegrape project is based on biologically integrated farming
methods that the Commission has been promoting since 1992.  At
that time it began an integrated pest management program to promote
effective and rapid adoption of sustainable winegrape production
practices and to promote economic development in San Joaquin County
by cultivating a market niche for winegrapes produced with more
environmentally sensitive viticulture practices. According to
Chandler, the BIFS grant will help the Commission accomplish its
goal of extending adoption of sustainable practices throughout
the region.
<P>
 The two model farms involved in the winegrape project are the
120-acre Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard owned by Lange Twins Farm,
and Kautz Farm's 30-acre Zinfandel vineyard, both of which have
documented substantial reductions in pesticide use in the last
five years.  Both farms have tracked the use of compost, cover
crops, beneficial insects and other farming practices.  
<H3>Team Monitoring</H3>

<P>
The farmers who have signed up to participate in the winegrape
project will be evaluated by the BIFS team at the onset of the
project and will be monitored seasonally.  The Commission will
conduct ongoing side-by-side comparisons of yields and pesticide
use between the BIFS-farmed blocks and conventionally farmed blocks
on the farms of cooperating growers.  The results of the comparisons
will be made available with other project data at monthly grower
meetings and field days and at smaller neighborhood grower meetings.
<P>
 The Westside project is designed to facilitate information exchange
among area farmers, consultants and researchers on soil-building
practices and options for reduced reliance on agrichemicals. 
The project will monitor and evaluate on-farm demonstrations of
these practices, determine the extent to which IPM practices are
used in row crops on the Westside and identify problems preventing
further adoption.  It will also provide community demonstrations
of technologies while making use of participatory research teams
to develop and refine additional information.  The project will
provide technical assistance to farmers and their consultants,
and intensive pest management monitoring of fields enrolled in
the project.  
<P>
The farms used in the Westside project include O'Neill Farms,
a 7,200-acre diversified row crop operation near Five Points,
and <B>John Diener's </B>4,500-acre farming operation between
Five Points and Huron.  Side-by-side comparisons between conventionally
managed and biologically-based production systems will be established
on the 13 cooperator farms.  A common Westside crop rotation of
tomatoes/cotton/onions-garlic will be followed at most sites.
<P>
Both BIFS pilot projects are funded for one year.  Contingent
upon demonstrated progress, the projects will be eligible for
renewed funding for two additional years.

<P>
  
<P>
<I>SARE and ACE research grants:</I>
<P>
A Call for Proposals has been issued for SARE and ACE projects.
 The SARE program is funded through USDA Cooperative State Research,
Education and Extension Service, under Chapter 1 of Title XVI
of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990.
 Proposals funded through SARE should promote good stewardship
of the nation's natural resources by providing site specific and
profitable sustainable farming and ranching methods that strengthen
agricultural competitiveness; maintain and enhance soil; conserve
soil, water, energy, natural resources, and fish and wildlife
habitat; protect the health of people and animals involved in
agriculture and enhance the quality of life and employment in
rural communities; and examine the regional, economic, social
and environmental implications of the adoption of sustainable
agriculture practices and systems.  The ACE Program is funded
jointly by the Pollution Prevention Office of EPA and the SARE
program.  ACE projects should promote the adoption of sustainable
practices and reduce the misuse of nutrients and pesticides. ACE
priority issues include irrigated agriculture, nutrient management,
environmentally sound multiple land uses, and animal waste management.
 Funding may also be available for proposals that specifically
reduce pesticide use in target crops.  Funds have not yet been
determined by Congress, but it is anticipated that there will
be approximately $1,000,000 for new SARE projects and approximately
$160,000-$300,000 for new ACE projects. Proposals are due to the
Western Region SARE office at Utah State University by  <B>November
8, 1995.</B>
<P>
<I>Farmer/Rancher Research grants:</I>
<P>
Producers and producer groups residing in the Western U.S. will
be eligible to compete for SARE Farmer/Rancher Research Grants.
 The Call for Proposals for those grants is expected to be released
November 6, 1995.  Grants will be made for projects that identify,
evaluate and test sustainable agriculture practices and provide
innovative solutions to local problems. Research proposals must
be led by one or more producers, include a professional agricultural
technical advisor and provide a plan for sharing information with
others in the community. Proposals are due to the Western Region
SARE office at Utah State University by  <B>January 17, 1996.</B>
<P>
<I>Professional Development/In-Service Education Projects:</I>
<P>
Proposals are sought for projects helping Cooperative Extension
Service, Natural Resource Conservation Service, and other agricultural
professionals within the Western Region to increase their understanding
and proficiency in the area of sustainable agriculture.  Projects
must address education and professional development that will
improve their ability to conduct education programs and activities
in sustainable agriculture and to respond to inquiries from farmers,
ranchers and the public regarding sustainable agriculture concepts
and systems.  Proposals are due <B>December 6, 1995</B> to <B>Jill
Shore Auburn,</B> Western Regional Training Coordinator, University
of California, Davis.
<P>

<H1>Social capital and sustainability: Agriculture and communities

<I>Cornelia Butler Flora</I>
<P>
<I>Journal Paper No. J16309, Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics
Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa (Project No. 3281). 1995</I>
<P>
Evidence is mounting that the benefits of sustainable agriculture
are not merely environmental and do not stop at the farm gate,
but also improve community wellbeing. Documenting these social
and economic changes is becoming easier as greater numbers of
farmers, often concentrated in particular places, are adopting
sustainable production and marketing practices. At the same time,
social scientists in a variety of fields are discovering the unique
importance for community development of &quot;social capital,&quot;
defined as &quot;features of social organization, such as networks,
norms and trust, that facilitate coordination and cooperation
for mutual benefit.&quot; (Putnam, 1993) New methods for measuring
social capital at the community level are making it possible for
researchers to compare social relationships in communities where
sustainable agriculture is practiced widely with thos in communities
surrounded by industrial agriculture. A long line of sociological
research has linked industrial agriculture with community decline.
The question today is: Can sustainable agriculture reverse this
trend
<P>
Cornelia Butler Flora, currently a rural sociologist at Iowa State
University, has been a leading scholar in this field for many
years. In this article Flora reports the results of a fiveyear
study of four Midwest communities. She wanted to know if sustainable
agriculture contributes to community social capital by enhancing
the community's ability to identify problems, consider alternatives,
and make needed adjustments after solutions are first implemented;
or, alternatively, if it detracts from healthy community development
by creating isolated subgroups who distrust each other. 
<H3>Methodology</H3>

<P>
Flora selected her four communities from a recently published
study funded by the Northwest Area Foundation (1995). Researchers
in that study developed an index to classify farms as either &quot;sustainable&quot;
or &quot;conventional.&quot; The index consisted of three criteria:
1) reduction in the use of purchased chemicals and fertilizers,
2) use of ecological practices such as natural fertilizers, more
complex crop rotations, and diversified crop and livestock production,
and 3) commitment to these practices as a longterm goal reflected
in the farmer's values. Those who scored highest on the index
were classified as &quot;sustainable&quot; and those who scored
lowest as &quot;conventional.&quot; The authors of the Northwest
Area Foundation study were careful to note that the farmers labeled
&quot;sustainable&quot; were not sustainable in any absolute sense,
but only in relation to other farmers surveyed. Likewise, those
labeled as &quot;conventional&quot; were only relatively less
sustainable than others on the index. The &quot;conventional&quot;
label was only applied to those who scored at the low extreme
of the index, thus allowing comparisons between two groups with
polar opposite practices and values.
<P>
For her study, Flora selected two communities identified in the
Foundation study as having a critical mass of &quot;sustainable&quot;
farmers and matched each of these with a community of similar
size, agricultural potential, and distance from major population
centers and highways whose farmers were identified as &quot;conventional.&quot;
Between 1989 and 1994, each of the four was studied using the
techniques of community ethnography, a way of operationalizing
a variety of measures of social infrastructure and providing a
description of a community's institutions and setting. Among the
specific techniques used were content analysis of local newspapers,
analysis of census data, field visits, interviews with community
leaders, windshield surveys to determine social class indicators,
and simply hanging out in cafes, stores and other businesses talking
with owners, patrons and employees. Each of the four communities
had a population under 2,000.
<P>
The agricultural economies of the two pairs of communities were
slightly different. Communities in one pair were located in alluvial
plains, and consisted primarily of locally owned dairy and row
crop operations of moderate size. Communities in the second pair
were located in glaciated areas with less rainfall, and featured
cattle production and small grains. Flora notes that in the sustainable
farming communities, levels of community cohesion and cooperation
were low when the study began in 1989, as indicated primarily
by the absence of functioning civic organizations and lowachieving
town governments.
<H3>Findings and Conclusions</H3>

<P>
Over the course of the fiveyear study little change in community
cohesion or effectiveness was noted in the two communities featuring
conventional agriculture. By contrast, both communities where
sustainable agriculture was more widely practiced experienced
significant increases in their ability to mobilize community resources
for development (Table 1). Flora found that a significant factor
in the renewal was a shift that redefined sustainable farmers
as community resources rather than sources of embarrassment. In
one town, the local sustainable agriculture organization became
an important part of the community fabric, sponsoring a variety
of communitywide events. This in turn helped to spark a revival
in city government, and ultimately to the creation of a highly
successful community development plan with state backing.
<P>
The other community formed an economic development task force,
which invested in an organic seed cleaning facility for local
farmers to replace a business that had left the community. A small
input supply and machinery repair shop in the town developed a
field implement particularly useful for sustainable farmers and
began to market this product by mail order.
<P>
Interpreting these and related findings, Flora believes that &quot;movement
toward sustainable agriculture through local sustainable farming
organizations in a community is associated with, although not
necessarily determinant of, an increase in a community's social
capital&quot; (p. 16). A critical factor is the problemsolving
mindset that is integral to sustainable farming, the ability to
adapt to local conditions while striving toward economic, environmental
and social goals. As Flora puts it, &quot;community citizens and
farmers both begin to see that their action,collective for communities
and individual or household for farms,can make a difference in
achieving goals&quot; (p. 16). The farmer and the community no
longer define themselves as victims of big government or outside
industry, but begin to distinguish choices they can make to enhance
economic security and environmental quality. According to Flora,
&quot;...a pattern of problem solving guided by norms of mutual
trust and reciprocity is encouraged by the sustainable agriculture
movement and the various organizations that give social expression
to that movement, and that this is what helps to nurture and build
social capital within small, agriculturally dependent rural communities&quot;
(p. 2). 
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
Flora's study demonstrates that the somewhat nebulous concept
of &quot;social capital&quot; can be successfully operationalized
and linked to sustainable agriculture. While her data alone cannot
prove the thesis that sustainable agriculture benefits community
development by increasing social capital, it opens up a fertile
new area for empirical investigation. Given the obvious dissimilarities
between the isolated, small communities Flora studies and California's
rural communities (typically larger and with greater proximity
to urban centers), her work cannot be taken as an exact blueprint
for testing the social capital thesis here. It is unlikely that
one could find communities in California  where boundaries are
discrete enough and farming practices so clearly distinguishable,
to enable the sort of community comparisons she has employed.
<P>
On the other hand, California is a ripe setting for studying how
the proliferation of grower information netwrks, local marketing
groups, farmland preservation coalitions, and other sustainable
agriculture organizations at the local, regional and statewide
levels are developing social capital that is benefiting the state
and its communities. As in the Midwest, new levels of trust, cooperation,
and an empowering problemsolving focus are creating both a heightened
subjective sense of belonging and tangible economic gains. We
need studies that articulate the impact of changing production
and marketing techniques on community social and economic organization,
including support networks, community values, and levels of trust
and cohesion. Flora's study is one useful example, as is a recent
Cornell study of farmers' markets which found that the social
capital created by pursuing sustainable agriculture often serves
as an incubator for creating new businesses that benefit the entire
community (Lyson et al., 1995). The growth of this type of research
is a welcome sign that the socioeconomic dynamics of sustainable
agriculture are beginning to get the attention they deserve from
social scientists.

<H1>North Coast apple scab trials 1993/1994, organic and conventional
materials comparison.</H1>

<P>
<I>Paul Vossen and Doug Gubler</I>
<P>
<I>Adapted from Plant Protection Quarterly 5(2):17.  1995.</I>
<P>
<I>Editor's note: This article is adapted from the UC Plant Protection
Quarterly, Volume 5, Number 2. It describes experiments conducted
in 1993 and 1994. Vossen reports that similar results were obtained
for the 1995 season. The full summary of data is too large to
include here; contact the author for detailed results.</I>
<P>
Apple scab, <I>Venturia inaequalis</I>, is a serious fungal disease
on apples in the North Coast region of California. It is particularly
severe during early spring when leaves, flowers, and fruit are
developing. If not adequately controlled, especially in rainy
years, scab can cause almost total destruction of an apple crop
and defoliation of trees. Growers typically apply conventional
fungicides at seven to ten day intervals, starting at the green
tip stage, to prevent infection of susceptible tissue. There are
many fungicides that provide temporary protection against apple
cab and some provide a short term curative action (kickback) on
leaves that have already become infected.
<P>
Some modern fungicides offer more than 10 days of protection,
over 96 hours of kickback activity, and a minimum of phytotoxicity.
They can be used after fruit formation without causing fruit russeting,
a chemical burn of the fruit skin. Prior to their development,
liquid lime sulfur was a commonly used fungicide. It provides
approximately five days of protection, 36 to 72 hours of kickback
activity, but is risky to use after fruit formation because it
can burn foliage and fruit if applied during warm weather. Liquid
lime sulfur and other alternative materials are currently staging
a resurgence because of their status as products that can be used
in an &quot;organic&quot; production system.
<P>
Food safety and environmental protection are two very important
issues to today's consumer. Therefore, the use of conventional
pesticides has come under increased scrutiny and the use of alternatives
under increased demand. Many North Coast apple growers are trying
to produce apples organically to take advantage of higher market
prices brought about by demand for environmentally sensitive fruit
production methods. Apple scab has limited the ability of these
growers to produce organicallygrown apples economically due to
yields losses when scab causes flower drop and lower prices for
blemished, misshapen, and smaller fruit.
<P>
Materials which are legally classified as &quot;organic&quot;
by the state health and safety code and Organic Food Act of 1990
were tested in these experiments and include fixed coppers (Kocide
&amp; COCS), wettable micronized sulfur (Thiolux), lime sulfurs
(Liquid Lime Sulfur &amp; Orthorix), mineral oils (Hytech &amp;
Stylet), insecticidal soap (MPede) and nutritional supplements
(Stoma Feast and Compost Tea).
<P>
Many growers have used several of these materials to control apple
scab, but without direct comparisons. Fixed coppers have never
been used much because they can cause fruit russeting. The various
sulfur materials have been used for years. Oils and insecticidal
soaps have been effective in controlling powdery mildew on some
plants and in controlling some insect pests. Stoma Feast is a
multimineral supplement in a gelatinous base and when combined
with fixed copper and sulfur, it is claimed to enhance their effectiveness.
Compost tea is made by bubbling air for 21 days through a mixture
of water and finished compost made from dairy manure. Brewer's
yeast is added to the liquid 24 hours prior to use. It looks like
thinneddown molasses with an agreeable organic odor. Compost tea
presumably coats leaves with antagonistic fungi and bacteria and/or
provides a nutritional stimulation to leaves, flowers, and fruit
and thus prevents apple scab infection.
<P>
The conventional fungicides Captan, Ziram, Funginex, Benlate,
and Topsin have been used for scab control for many years. These,
plus two relatively new materials, Rally and Rubigan, control
scab but cannot be used in an organic system. Fluazinam is a nonregistered
new product for control of apple scab. Benlate and Topsin have
not been used for several years because resistance has developed
by the fungus, and thus they were not included in this trial.
<P>
The experiments tested the efficacy of currently available organic
chemicals in comparison to several conventional fungicides. Four
different orchards were selected, each with a history of severe
apple scab infection.
<H3>Overall Comparisons</H3>

<P>
After two years of experiments and several years of observations,
we have come to a number of conclusions about organic materials
for control of apple scab.
<P>
<B>Lime sulfur </B>is difficult to work with, especially out of
large drums. It cntrols scab moderately well in the early part
of the season but not as well as Thiolux or fixed coppers. When
used after fruit formation it causes russeting on fruit even at
a lower rate (1 gallon per 100 gallons of water). It can be used
to eradicate or give kickback control of infections within 36
to 72 hours of the infection period.
<P>
<B>Orthorix</B> is very similar to lime sulfur but somewhat easier
to work with. It is used at a much lower rate since it is formulated
with a surfactant. It has the same tendency to russet fruit.
<P>
<B>Thiolux</B>, one of the micronized sulfurs, is easy to work
with but requires large quantities per acre (12 to 25 pounds).
It performed well in all trials with three to five welltimed applications.
Starting at the high rate and finishing at the lower rate when
fruit is formed, it did not cause fruit russeting. 
<P>
<B>Kocide </B>performed well in controlling scab infection on
fruit and leaves and is very easy to work with. At higher rates
(4 pounds per acre and above), it caused severe fruit russeting.
At 0.5 pounds per acre, it controlled scab without severe fruit
russeting. It also could be combined with Stylet oil or Thiolux
and used at a lower rate without fruit russeting and perhaps enhancing
control. Registration is pending in California. COCS performed
similar to Kocide in all experiments.
<P>
<B>Stylet Oil and Hytech Oil</B> showed some efficacy in controlling
apple scab. Stylet oil was more effective in combination with
one of the fixed coppers. Both were somewhat difficult to work
with since they were heavy liquids used at fairly high rates.
<P>
<B>MPede</B>, an insecticidal soap, showed some ability to prevent
scab infection, and was similar to the mineral oils.
<P>
Stoma Feast tended to congeal in the mixing process and plug the
sprayer filter, thereby altering spray nozzle emissions. Its effectiveness
in enhancing control is not known at this time.
<P>
<B>Compost Tea</B> was not effective in preventing scab infection
and in some cases appeared to enhance apple scab.
<P>
Timing of spring spray applications is a very important factor
in apple scab control since the fungicides used offer only temporary
protection or limited kickback activity. New tissue that is generated
by the tree during this rapid growth phase must be covered with
fungicide to prevent crop loss.
<P>
Most of the conventional fungicides used in these trials did an
excellent job in preventing apple scab infection. Several of the
organic materials have now been documented as potential alternatives
by also providing excellent control of scab. These materials can
be used for the purpose of lowering the environmental impact of
more toxic fungicides, to reduce the threat of resistance when
alternated with conventional fungicides, and to conform to organic
certification laws.

<H1>Best management practices for wheat: A guide to profitable
and environmentally sound production.</H1>

<P>
<I>Steve Watson (ed.)</I>
<P>
<I>National Association of Wheat Growers, Washington, DC.  1994</I>
<P>
The premise of this new handbook for wheat growers is that the
majority of farmers in the U.S. are trustworthy stewards of the
country's agricultural resources. It features both tried and true
methods of farming as well as innovative practices that respond
to many of the environmental concerns raised during the past decade,
particularly those related to soil and water quality. Steve Watson,
of Kansas State University is the editor. John Hickman (John Deere),
Jeff Jacobsen (Montana State University), and Drew Lyon (University
of Nebraska) are principal authors. 
<P>
The first half of the book is devoted to the principles of soil
erosion and water quality protection. It addresses the ecological
limitations that many wheat farmers face (i.e., sloped lands,
erodible soils, drought, and/or flooding) as well as the biological
and chemical aspects of nutrient and pesticide movement in soils.
This section provides important scientific background for developing
appropriate crop management practices. The principles are presented
in a manner that will be easily understood by a general audience.
<P>
The second half of the book presents practical applications of
these principles. The authors describe 39 different &quot;best
management practices&quot; (BMPs) being implemented around the
country. The BMPs outlined in this book are shown in Figure 1.
The authors divide them into two categories: Management BMPs which
generally involve decisions about the use of existing resources
and equipment, and Conseration BMPs which involve structural changes
in the farming operation as well as management decisions.
<P>
Not all BMPs will work for every farm or in every part of the
country, so growers are encouraged to judge for themselves whether
or not a particular practice is appropriate for their situation.
The final section of the handbook helps growers do this. Several
figures provide a graphical link between the BMPs and the principles
of erosion and water quality described in the first section. Additional
charts give growers the opportunity to describe their own resource
setting and the impact of various BMPs on the potential problem
areas. Examples are provided to help growers through the process.
<P>
Lastly, the handbook offers some guidelines for the economic analysis
of a particular BMP. While the basic economic principle of calculating
additional costs and additional returns holds for each BMP, how
that principle is applied can vary depending on the changes that
are made in the farm system. Four types of economic analyses are
described to address these differences: 1) changes in input usage
or modest changes in crop management; 2) changes in crop mix and
rotation; 3) changes in tillage practices; 4) changes in or addition
of structures.

<H1>Cover crop biology: A minireview.  Part I.</H1>

<P>
<I>Robert L. Bugg</I>
<P>
<I>Article written for Sustainable Agriculture Technical Reviews.
 1995</I>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Managing cover crops in orchards or vineyards depends in part
on understanding their basic biology.  This article, presented
in two parts, reviews several aspects of cover crop biology. 
Part I   looks at seeds, seedlings, rootzone biology, nutrient
uptake, and the fate of cover crop derived nitrogen.  Part II
(to appear in the next issue of <I>Sustainable Agriculture</I>,
Vol.8, No.1) will cover plant community dynamics and allelopathy.
 Most of the plant species discussed may be used as cover crops
or as forage crops in rangeland settings.  The issues raised have
general applicability to a number of farming systems in California.
<H3>Seeds and Seedlings</H3>

<P>
Williams and Elliott (1960) studied dryland northern Californian
populations of crimson clover (<I>Trifolium incarnatum</I>), rose
clover (<I>T. hirtum</I>), and subterranean clover (<I>T. subterraneum</I>)
with respect to: 1) amount of impermeable seed produced, 2) the
rate at which seeds become permeable, and 3) factors causing breakdown
of impermeability of rose clover. Crimson clover impermeability
declined to a low level in the months after seed maturation. Subterranean
clover followed a similar pattern, though slightly delayed. At
one site under marine influence, subterranean clover retained
a moderate proportion of impermeable seed into autumn. Rose clover
maintained a large proportion of hard seed throughout the summer,
autumn, and winter months. High temperatures at and slightly above
the soil surface were demonstrated to cause breakdown of rose
clover impermeability. Rose clover is able to persist better than
crimson or subterranean clovers in most dryland northern Californian
settings. This characteristic is probably in part due to its prolific
production of impermeable seed.
<P>
According to Williams (1956), during establishment, the force
produced by legume seedlings may be crucial in overcoming the
weight of overlying soil and surface crusts. Using glass tubes
containing vermiculite and glass rods of known mass, the force
produced by seeds of crimson clover, rose clover, subterranean
clover, and alfalfa was estimated. Mean forces exerted (in grams,
+/ standard error of mean) were estimated as follows. Alfalfa
(15.2 +/ 0.5), crimson clover (23.8 +/ 0.2), rose clover (24.1
+/ 0.5), subterranean clover (60.0 +/ 2.9). The force exerted
by the seeds was highly correlated (R=0.999) with seed weight,
but not so highly (R=0.837) with hydrolyzable carbohydrates, suggesting
that other factors may be involved.
<P>
Williams (1963) later found that crimson clover varieties showed
great variability in the amount of force exerted by seedlings.
_Autauga' F.C. 32, 963 and Mississippi selection F.C. 32, 964
showed particularly great forces. These greatly exceeded those
of rose clover, _Caliverde' and _Ranger' alfalfa, and _Kenland'
red clover. Forces exerted by crimson clover and alfalfa were
highly dependent on temperature, with the maximum force attained
for the former near 20 C, and for the latter between 25 and 30
C. These patterns suggest that plantings could be timed to correspond
with sufficiently warm weather to achieve good emergence of seedlings.
<H3>RootZone Dynamics And Nutrient Uptake</H3>

<P>
<B>Nitrogen</B>
<P>
Schomberg and Weaver (1990) found that the addition of the equivalent
of 31 kg per hectare of starter nitrogen did not reduce nitrogen
fixation by arrowleaf clover, and substantially improved seedling
vigor. Starter nitrogen can actually lead to improved nitrogen
fixation by legumes.
<P>
In a threeyear field trial in Germany, Benkenstein et al. (1990)
assessed uptake of nitrate (from sodium nitrate) and ammonium
(from ammonium sulfate) by winter cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I>
cv _Janos') through the growing season, as a function of depth
of placement in the soil (40, 60, and 80 cm beneath the surface).
Sampling indicated that cereal rye plants absorbed 72 percent
of the nitrate derived from the 40cm placement, and 18 percent
of that derived from the 80cm placement.
<P>
In Germany, Raderschall and Gebhardt (1990) evaluated winter crops
of rape (<I>Brassica napus</I>), barley (<I>Hordeum vulgare</I>),
and Welsh rygrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I>). These respectively
accumulated in their aboveground structures 52.1, 36.2, and 22.9
kg of nitrogen per hectare following bell bean (cv _Alfred').
<P>
Guiraud et al. (1990) conducted a lysimeter study in which a catch
crop of annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I>) reduced nitrate
leaching from 124 kg of nitrogen per hectare to 40 kg of nitrogen
per hectare. The percentages of fertilizer nitrogen (as a percentage
of total nitrogen) in the water were 19 and 7 percent in covercropped
and bare fallow plots, respectively. To a depth of 30 cm, 23 percent
of labeled nitrogen was retained in organic form where ryegrass
had been incorporated, versus 15 percent under bare fallow.
<P>
Jackson et al. (1993) evaluated several potential winterannual
nitrogen catch crops for rotation with lettuce in the Salinas
Valley of California sown in November and harvested the following
March. Particularly promising in terms of nitrogen assimilation
were white senf mustard (<I>Brassica hirta</I> cv _Martigena'
200 kg of nitrogen per hectare), cereal rye (<I>Secale cereale</I>
cv _Merced'  129 kg of nitrogen per hectare), tansy phacelia (<I>Phacelia
tanacetifolia </I>cv _Phaci' 182 kg of nitrogen per hectare),
 white mustard (Brassica alba  205 kg of nitrogen per hectare),
and oilseed radish (<I>Raphanus sativus</I> cv _Renova' 161 kg
of nitrogen per hectare). Annual ryegrass (<I>Lolium multiflorum</I>
 85 kg of nitrogen per hectare) showed less capacity for nitrogen
absorption when used in this temporal niche.
<P>
<B>Phosphorus Uptake</B>
<P>
Hoffland et al. (1989) grew rape (<I>Brassica napus</I> cv _Jetneuf')
in agar plates and nutrient solution with or without phosphorus.
Bromocresol purple was included as a pH indicator. Acidification,
caused by exudation of citric and malic acids, occurred along
a restricted zone about 1.5 cm in length, just behind root tips.
Conditions were alkaline along the remainder of the root systems.
Concentrations of citric and malic acids were generally lower
for plants grown with sufficient phosphorus. Further work will
be needed to test whether the acidification observed leads to
solubilization of rock phosphate. Potassium, calcium, and nitrate
were taken up about twice as rapidly by plants with sufficient
phosphate than by plants grown in a phosphorusdeficient medium.
<P>
Gardner and Boundy (1983) found that wheat intercropped with white
lupin (<I>Lupinus albus</I>) has access to a larger pool of phosphorus,
manganese, and nitrogen than wheat grown in monoculture. The former
two nutrients were probably mobilized by exudates from the lupin
roots, then taken up by the closelyassociated wheat roots.
<P>
Based on pot experiments and a literature review, Paynter (1990)
concluded that burr medic (<I>Medicago polymorpha</I>) and barrel
medic (<I>Medicago truncatula</I>) are not as efficient at absorbing
soil phosphorus as is subterranean clover (<I>Trifolium subterraneum</I>).
<P>
Annan and Amberger (1989) investigated the ability of buckwheat
(<I>Fagopyrum esculentum</I>) to acquire phosphorus. The authors
investigated phosphorus uptake, morphological features, and chemical
changes in the rhizosphere. Root weight and length, and frequency
of root hairs were higher when plants were grown under phosphorus
deficiency. Phosphorus uptake rates were only moderate; concentrations
of phosphorus in the shoot were high (1.8% of dry weight). Release
of P from FePO4 and glucose6phosphate was not due to a buildup
of organic acids in the rhizosphere, but to high activities of
acid phosphatase, an enzyme produced by buckwheat plants growing
in low phosphorus conditions. The following parameters were regarded
as important for buckwheat's phosphorus efficiency: 1) a finely
divided root system of considerable length, with a high ratio
of root surface to root or shoot length; 2) a high storage capacity
for inorganic phosphorus, 3) an increased release of protons and
FePO4 or MnO2 solubilizing substances by phosphorus deficient
plants; 4) a favorable ratio of phosphorus uptake to root mass
increase, especially at low phosphorus supply; and 5) a high activity
of acid phosphatase in the rhizosphere and the capability to use
phosphorus from organic sources.
<H3>Fate of Nitrogen Derived from Cover Crops</H3>

<P>
Sawatsky and Soper (1991) grew field peas using a splitroot procedure.
 The study suggested that at the time of harvest, 22 to 46 percent
of the belowground nitrogen had been shed into the rhizosphere
(root zone). Because this nitrogen &quot;rhizodeposition&quot;
has not previously been assessed for annual legumes, nitrogen
fixation may be underestimated by about 10 percent.
<P>
Fox et al<I>.</I> (1990) reported that in order for nitrogen mineralization
to occur, nitrogen concentration of incorporated residue must
exceed 15 to 25 grams per kg.  However, little mineralization
will occur if there are high concentrations of lignin or polyphenols.
 These workers reported a study involving the decomposition of
and nitrogen mineralization from residues of six kinds of legumes
(alfalfa, round leaf cassia, leucaena, Fitzroy stylo, snail medic,
and <I>Vigna trilobata</I>), in which the ratio of lignin+polyphenols
to nitrogen content was a good predictor of nitrogen mineralization
rate, whereas initial nitrogen concentration of residues was not.
 After 12 weeks, net nitrogen mineralized ranged from 11 percent
from round leaf cassia to 47 percent for alfalfa.
<P>
In Terman's (1979) review of ammonia volatilization, he noted
that crop utilization of nitrogen from surfaceapplied materials
ranges from 30 to 70 percent and may average about 50 percent.
 Losses of ammonia (NH3) increase with increase in the intensity
of drying conditions (higher temperatures, more air movement,
and lower humidity), with higher soil pH, with coarsetextured
soils of low cation exchange capacity, and with lower initial
soil moisture content.  Losses are very low if various nitrogen
sources are incorporated into the soil or are moved at once into
the soil by rain or irrigation.
<P>
Janzen and McGinn (1991) reported three experiments evaluating
ammonia volatilization from decomposing lentil residue (<I>Lens
culinaris </I>Medik.).   The first experiment showed that after
56 days, ammonia volatilization from residue left on the soil
surface represented five percent of applied nitrogen.  Incorporating
the residue into the soil stopped nearly all NH3 loss.
<P>
In Georgia, on gravelly clay loam and sandy clay loam soils, McVay
et al. (1989) conducted a trial of notill corn and sorghum production
under various covercropping regimes.  Hairy vetch and crimson
clover grown as winter cover crops, respectively, replaced on
the average 123 and 99 kg per hectare of fertilizer nitrogen.
 The corresponding aboveground nitrogen contents of cover crop
herbage were 128 and 108 kg of nitrogen per hectare.  These results
suggest efficient cycling of nitrogen in a notill system, with
minimal losses due to volatilization of ammonia.  Harper et al.
(1995) reported that in Georgia for crimson clover preceding sorghum
under notill management, volatilization of ammonia was minimal:
323 kg of nitrogen per hectare accumulated in the crimson clover,
and an estimated 0.25 kg of nitrogen per hectare (less than 0.1%)
was lost by volatilization of NH3.
<P>
By contrast, in the Northeast and the Midwest, cyclic wetting
and drying may lead to the loss of from onethird to onehalf of
the nitrogen contained in surfacemanaged leguminous residues,
regardless of the pH of the soil (Sarrantonio and Scott, 1988).
 Even if field conditions do not lead to substantial volatilization
of ammonia, nitrogen availability to the target crop may be delayed
in notill systems, as suggested by Lemon et al. (1990) for berseem
clover preceding grain sorghum in Burleson County, Texas.
<P>
Dr. William L. Hargrove of the University of Georgia has extensive
experience in managing notill coolseason annual legumes and in
assessing their nitrogen contributions to warmseason annual field
crops; h is also an authority on ammonia volatilization.  In discussions
with the author, Hargrove (personal communication, 1994) stated
that ammonia volatilization should be minimal and nitrogen from
cover crop residues should become available to trees if understory
conditions remain relatively moist during the principal period
that the clippings are decomposing.  Shading and irrigation, of
course, would aid in maintaining the desired moist conditions.
 Hargrove further indicated that staggered mowing patterns, as
often recommended in managing orchard cover crops, will further
reduce volatilization by reducing the concentration of ammonia
during any one period of decomposition.  Rainfall in Georgia averages
about four inches per month throughout the year; this corresponds
well with the amounts of water applied to sprinklerirrigated almond
orchards (91 cm [36 inches] over nine months), and is less than
the amounts applied to walnut orchards (122 cm [48 inches] over
seven to eight months).
<H3> Conclusion</H3>

<P>
In managing cover crops, many issues must be considered.  Here,
I have presented a selection of research results on cover crop
ecology, emphasizing the dynamics of stand establishment and maintenance,
and nutrient cycling.  Our knowledge of cover crop ecology is
still fragmentary, yet it is progressing rapidly.  Thus, these
and other results may ultimately be used to develop comprehensive
views and management plans.  For this to happen most efficiently,
farmers, advisors, and scientists should discuss not only the
scientific papers themselves, but also the applicability, adaptability,
or nonapplicability of the findings within the context of particular
farms, or even individual fields.  Scientific data like those
presented here take on their most important life when they enable
farmers to fulfill their aims with minimal expenditure and environmental
risk.

<H1><U><I>From the Director</I></U> - Cooperative Extension's
Broad Impact</H1>

<P>
As it is widely known Cooperative Extension (CE) is a major part
of every land grant university. Each California county has a group
of people from CE (farm and home advisors and staff) who attempt
to help community members with many issues. These advisors have
been working for local communities since 1913. They carry out
research and education programs in their regions and are the conduit
between the UC campuses and the fields and homes of California.
That effort continues today even in the face of reduced budgets,
resources and staff, and increased demands to change farming practices.
<P>
Extension advisors' activities are quite diverse; they deal with
human and natural resource issues and research and education to
help produce the food and fiber we all consume. Their efforts
to maintain agricultural sustainability are increasingly important
to both consumers and producers.
<P>
I have been traveling with members of the SAREP staff to various
Cooperative Extension offices in the San Joaquin Valley to find
out what projects individual farm advisors are working on so that
we at SAREP can stay current, and so that we can foster collaboration
with our colleagues in the counties.
<P>
In late February, we met with advisors in Stanislaus and Merced
counties; in March we traveled to Fresno and Madera counties.
We will soon meet with farm advisors in Tulare and Kings counties.
Farm advisors in these counties continue to work on a diverse
array of projects related to agricultural sustainability. 
<P>
For example, Stanislaus County Director Phil Osterli is involved
in a project in West Stanislaus County with the goal of reducing
the amount of non-point source pollution (sediment, pesticides,
and fertilizer) being carried to the San Joaquin River. This project,
which is a cooperative venture with the area Resource Conservation
District and Natural Resource Conservation Service staff, helps
farmers develop best management practices to farm in a more environmentally
friendly manner, while at the same time saving themselves money.

<P>
Other farm advisors in the area are working on projects to improve
the environment while reducing farmers' costs. <B>Bill Weir</B>
has found out that the total amount of nitrogen used on cotton
can be reduced by up to twenty percent. <B>Maxwell Norton</B>
has worked to reduce pesticide use in the treatment of apple scab,
and was involved in the first commercial-scale pheromone mating
disruption project with IPM Area Advisor emeritus <B>Bill Barnett.
</B>
<P>
<B>Lonnie Hendricks</B> in Merced County has been instrumental
in the development of BIOS (Biological Integrated Orchard Systems),
a program which is gaining acceptance among almond growers because
of its team approach to the establishment of environmentally and
economically sound farming systems.
<P>
<B>Norton </B>and <B>Hendricks</B> have organized IPM grower breakfasts
for almost ten years. Much information is shared at these breakfast
meetings and pest control advisors also attend to learn and discuss
new farming methods.
<P>
Merced County Director <B>Jim Farley</B> is working with UCD collaborators
on a multidisciplinary approach to swine health. In Fresno County,
<B>Linda Manton</B>, like other county directors, serves not only
as the office administrator, but also as the liaison with government,
agricultural and private agencies and organizations. Her research
interests lie in community development and public policy. <B>Steve
Sutter</B>, the Ag Personnel Management advisor in Fresno County,
works on issues of farm labor and safety. He has developed a checklist
of labor regulations and safety programs in both English and Spanish.
<P>
These are examples of projects that touch us all, either as producers
or consumers or both. We at SAREP are making special efforts to
cooperate with these advisors and researchers to see to it information
on their work in sustainable agriculture is available statewide.
For more on these and other Cooperative Extension projects that
work toward sustainability, see &quot;From the Field,&quot; on
pages 2 and 3. Fresno and other counties will be highlighted in
future issues.

county visits.)
<H2>STANISLAUS COUNTY:</H2>

<P>
<B>Phil Osterli</B>: County Director Osterli is involved in a
water quality project to reduce furrow irrigation-induced erosion.
He and his staff, the staffs of the local Resource Conservation
District, the Natural Resource Conservation Service and other
local agencies have formed the West Stanislaus Hydrologic Unit
Area (HUA). Their goal is to significantly reduce the amount of
non-point source pollution (sediment, pesticides and fertilizer)
reaching the San Joaquin River. A voluntary effort, the local
agencies have formulated best management practices, and growers
are determining their own water plans. Growers and irrigators
working for them are invited to use the services of local agencies
to get the most recent information on irrigation and drainage
practices for their operations. Local farmers are eligible for
technical and cash assistance from the Consolidated Farm Service
Agency, which has received federal money for water quality management
programs.
<P>
Osterli continues to evaluate large and baby limas for lygus resistance
with <B>Jesus Valencia</B>, Stanislaus CE office, and <B>Steve
Temple</B>, UC Davis Agronomy Extension. The field testing is
taking place in Colusa and Stanislaus counties.
<P>
<B>Kathy Kelley</B>: Kelley is doing Peach Twig Borer pheromone
confusion work in apricots with <B>Walt Bentley,</B> an area IPM
advisor. She notes that baby food producers are getting some consumer
pressure to reduce pesticides and are eager to do so.
<P>
She is also investigating sprays for grape bunch rot. Kelley believes
that although spray use is down, in most years growers don't need
all the sprays they are using.
<P>
Kelley notes that walnut husk flies are usually handled using
bait and malathion. She says malathion use can be reduced if application
timing is accurate, but achieving accurate timing can be a problem.
She is working with growers on this issue. She says there is a
great deal of variation among growers on how they handle their
husk fly traps_where the traps are placed, how accurately they
are observed.
<P>
<B>Jesus Valencia</B>: Valencia is working to develop a forecasting
model for powdery mildew in tomatoes with <B>Mike Davis</B> at
UCD (also involved are <B>Gene Miyao</B> in Yolo County, <B>Bob
Mullen</B> in San Joaquin County, and <B>Richard Smith</B> in
San Benito County). The goal is to develop a powdery mildew forecasting
technique to help growers determine if and when to apply pesticides,
as opposed to applying materials solely on a calendar basis.
<P>
He is working with <B>Ed Perry, </B>also a Stanislaus County farm
advisor, on a composting project funded by the California Integrated
Waste Management Board. They are experimenting with composted
community-derived green waste material. The project is divided
in half: ornamental plants and vegetable crops. He is using compost
as a source of nutrients, spread at two rates, 10 and 20 tons
per acre on sweet corn, watermelon and tomatoes. The compost is
being compared to the use of commercial fertilizer.
<P>
He is also evaluating nematode resistance in tomato varieties
and crop rotations of both resistant and non-resistant tomato
varieties in Stanislaus County. The goal is to determine what
will happen if a farmer plants a resistant variety one year, and
then rotates in a non-resistant variety the next year_will nematodes
return, or will they cease to be a problem? He has found that
the nematodes don't reproduce on resistant cultivars, so the populations
are reduced equal to or greater than for a fumigation. This work
is a continuation of the work of Stanislaus County Director <B>Phil
Osterli</B> and Cooperative Extension Nematology Specialist <B>Phil
Roberts</B> (Roberts is currently at UC Riverside). They worked
with <B>Don May</B> of Fresno County in green baby limas and found
that using nematode-resistant lima bean cultivars lowered the
population of nematodes in succeeding crops to numbers equivalent
to those found following a fumigation. In all cases, nematode-resistant
crops did better than fumigation.
<P>
<B>Ed Perry:</B> Perry is working on the composting project with
<B>Jesus Valencia</B>. He is conducting the landscape plant part
of the project at Modesto Junior College and at a private nursery
in Stanislaus County. He is growing five species of landscape
plants (40 replications per species) using five different treatments.
He is using the community-derived compost in some, and traditional
ground tree bark/sand/custom mix growing material in others for
comparison. The five treatments include 100 percent compost, 75
percent compost/25 percent grower mix; 50/50; 25 percent compost/75
percent grower mix; and 100 percent grower mix. The plants will
be evaluated for total growth, aesthetic quality, total mass,
leaf samples, and other measurements.
<P>
In another project, Perry is evaluating the effect of mulches
derived from different tree species: 100 percent chip mulch from
pine, eucalyptus and walnut. The study, which began in June 1994,
is measuring the growth of trees planted in containers with these
mulches. There has been anecdotal information that these mulches
could be toxic to trees, but no negative effect has been observed.
The first part of the study is completed; the mulch in the containers
has now broken down into compost. The second part of the study
is evaluating the compost from the different tree mulches. The
project will try to determine if compost from the trees is too
acidic. So far, the containerized plants are doing well.
<P>
Perry is involved in several pest management projects. He screened
pheromones that attract the Western Poplar Clearwinged Moth, a
serious pest for birch, poplar and locust trees. Identifying the
pheromone or complex of pheromones is the first step in setting
up a management system. He has also been involved in a successful
aphid-monitoring project for landscape trees for several years.
He notes that city landscape maintenance staff members in the
project have been very willing to monitor trees before treating
for aphids. Perry's work was featured as a case study in the <I>Journal
of Arboriculture </I>(Vol. 21, No. 1, January 1995) article written
by <B>Steve Dreistadt</B> and <B>Mary Louise Flint </B>of the
Statewide UC Integrated Pest Management Project.
<P>
<B>Marsha Campbell</B>: One of her particular interests is in
making silage production more sustainable by eliminating the scourge
of Johnson grass. The problem with Johnson grass is that the seeds
from even small patches on farms get into silage bunker silos.
Cows ingest them, they are spread in manure, and the seeds eventually
reach the dairy lagoon. The lagoon water goes throughout the farm,
turning what was originally a small Johnson grass patch problem
into a farmwide issue. Campbell notes that the best weed controls,
whether organic or chemical, were &quot;horribly inadequate.&quot;
Fields have been left out of a silage rotation or even left fallow
because there was no way to eliminate the Johnson grass seeds.
She has been involved with a test of a new herbicide which can
be applied in very small amounts (2/3 oz/acre) to fields for Johnson
grass control. She says the active ingredient acts only on a plant
enzyme, and is less toxic than many products. One of its advantages
is that it is a post-emergent material, and is only applied to
the visible problem. Previously, farmers had used many different
chemicals on fields infested with Johnson grass, to no avail.
In addition to cutting down on the use of other chemicals, she
says the product also makes it possible to use non-tillage practices,
which increases the efficiency of water and fertilizer use. No-till
allows a harder surface to develop, which makes it easier for
water to move across the fields. Currently the tilled, sandy soils
make it expensive and inefficient to irrigate; nitrates are frequently
washed down through the soil, which contributes to groundwater
problems.
<P>
Dairy waste management is also one of her interests, as dairies
are big business in Stanislaus County. Lagoon water from dairies
is an issue because it is a source of nitrates as well as weed
seeds. Stanislaus County has one of the worst problems in the
state with nitrates in the aquifers. Campbell would like to make
better use of the potassium and nitrates found in the lagoon water.
<P>
Campbell is interested in grain lupin as a forage. She notes that
it would be nice to have an alternative forage to &quot;get us
out of the corn/oat rotation.&quot; Lupin is a high protein, high
tonnage silage which can be used for human consumption. &quot;It
makes a really nice pasta,&quot; she says.

<P>
<B>Jim Farley:</B> County Director Farley and two collaborators,
Carolyn Stull from UC Davis Veterinary Medicine Extension and
<B>Jerry Koenig</B>, formerly of the Veterinary Medicine Teaching
and Research Center in Tulare, received a DANR grant to fund data
collection on the health and welfare of commercially raised swine.
They have finished data collection and are beginning the analysis
of extensive videotaped data. The swine were videotaped for 24
hours and then individual behavior was tracked. Farley says this
is a proactive study that will help the industry track its management.
<P>
<B>Maxwell Norton</B>: Norton has worked on a project to reduce
pesticide use in the treatment of apple scab. In prunes he was
involved in a project that investigated alternate-year pruning
to reduce labor costs, and a rootstock project with two objectives:
better disease resistance and less suckering.
<P>
In peaches Norton was involved in one of the first commercial-scale
mating trials in California with CE IPM Area Advisor emeritus
Bill Barnett, an entomologist. They also worked for three years
profiling a peach grower and his transition to organic production.
In that project they studied the transition itself and its problems,
and also provided technical assistance for the grower.
<P>
Norton and farm advisor <B>Lonnie Hendricks</B> have organized
IPM grower breakfast meetings throughout the growing season for
almost ten years. Much information is shared at the breakfasts,
and Norton and Hendricks use that time to teach pest control advisors
about IPM technologies.
<P>
In wine grapes Norton has worked on projects related to rootstock,
pruning systems, use of cryolite (an organic-approved pesticide),
and on a project related to timing Bt sprays for omnivorous leaf
roller. He is also involved in projects related to street trees
and farmland preservation.
<P>
<B>Lonnie Hendricks: </B>Hendricks has spent a great deal of time
in the last two years with the Biologically Integrated Orchard
System (BIOS) program, which started with his observations and
write-ups of brothers <B>Glenn </B>and<B> Ron Anderson</B>, two
Hilmar almond growers who farm side-by-side. Glenn grows organically
while Ron's operation was farmed conventionally. Hendricks says
their story was unique because they demonstrated that almonds
could be farmed using fewer pesticides. The California Alliance
with Family Farmers (CAFF) became interested in Glenn Anderson's
success as an organic almond grower and pursued grants with private
foundations and the US-EPA to set up the BIOS program for farmers.
They were also able to obtain support from corporate sponsors,
including donations of cover crop seeds and beneficial organisms.
The BIOS program helps enrolled farmers develop farm management
plans and provides financial incentives to reduce pesticides.
Hendricks is on the Merced management team (and on the Merced/Stanislaus
management team until another farm advisor can be recruited).
Regular meetings are held with enrolled farmers and their pest
control advisors and the general public.
<P>
He is continuing an almond cover crop plot with two replications,
now in its third year. He will continue the project through this
year, and either reseed or end the project. He is also working
with walnut varieties, and is testing two insect growth regulators
for codling moth control.
<P>
<B>Bill Weir:</B> Weir is working with organic cotton growers,
including <B>Claude Sheppard</B> whose almost 5,000 acres of cotton
are rotated with organic tomatoes. He is also working on cotton
compost trials with <B>Stu Pettygrove</B> from UCD. They have
a CDFA grant to compost gin trash with manure. They are working
with <B>John Texiera</B> in Dos Palos, an organic cotton grower.
<P>
Weir is conducting nitrogen rate tests, which are providing data
enabling farmers to reduce N rates while maintaining yields. Two
years of tests show that using 50-80 lbs &quot;up front&quot;
(at planting time) with more added during two to three irrigations
is effective. With this technique, growers only need to use between
160-180 lbs N for the season. Historically, growers applied 200
lbs N before planting cotton. n

<H1>Cover Cropping in Vineyards: Grower Profiles, Part 2</H1>

<H2>Lodi-Woodbridge WineGrape Commission</H2>

<P>
<I>[Editor's Note: The Grower Profile series is from a chapter
in a forthcoming SAREP publication on cover cropping in vineyards.
 The publication includes contributions by numerous UC and Natural
Resource Conservation Service researchers.  It is edited by <B>Chuck
Ingels</B> and <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A></B> of SAREP; <B>Glenn McGourty</B>,
Cooperative Extension director, Mendocino County; and <B>Peter
Christensen</B>, Cooperative Extensive Viticulture Specialist
at the UC Kearney Agriculture Center in Parlier.  For another
perspective on cover cropping in vineyards, please see &quot;Integrating
cover crops into grapevine pest an nutrition management: The transition
phase,&quot; page 11 of this issue.]</I>
<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP</I>
<P>
When <B>Dennis Culver</B> first began working with the Lodi-Woodbridge
Winegrape Commission in May 1992, many growers were already very
interested in cover cropping.  The Commission is a marketing and
research organization, and includes 650 growers who farm over
45,000 acres in this important viticultural region north of Stockton.
 According to Culver, the Commission's IPM program consultant,
growers had two primary reasons for using cover crops.  First,
cover cropping was viewed as an important strategy for increasing
biodiversity in the vineyards.  Cover crops provide a habitat
and food source for beneficial insects and spiders which may reduce
the need for pesticide applications.  The second goal in cover
cropping was to improve the soil and vine root environment by
building soil organic matter and improving water penetration.

<P>
In August 1992, Culver organized a meeting on cover crops which
further stimulated interest.  Following the meeting, cover crop
plantings increased dramatically.  That fall, Culver set up side-by-side
trials in several vineyards comparing cover-cropped versus fallowed
middles in five-acre blocks.  Although there were few pest problems
in 1993, Willamette mite populations did appear to be reduced
where the annual clover mixes were planted.  In these clovers
and in some high-nitrogen blends there may be a buildup of two-spotted
mites, according to Culver, which result in increased numbers
of beneficial arthropods in these cover crops.  These beneficials,
in turn, may move into the grapes and be responsible for reducing
Willamette mite populations in the grapes.  Similar trials will
be conducted each year to determine the long-term effects on pests.
<P>
While the jury is still out on the effects of individual cover
crops on grape pest management, Culver has specific recommendations
depending on the method of irrigation, soil type, and nutritional
needs.  With furrow irrigation, he recommends the annual clover
mix (subterranean, crimson, and rose clovers and barrel medic)
or a legume green manure mix (bell bean, field pea, common vetch,
and Lana woollypod vetch), sown in alternate middles the first
year.  The unplanted middles are eventually furrowed out in late
spring for irrigation.  Depending on the grower's preference,
alternate middles can be sown each year or the same middles can
be used.  If the same middles are used, growers are finding that
the annual clover mixes, in particular, are reseeding themselves
quite nicely.  According to Culver, the best strategy to facilitate
reseeding is as follows: 1) allow the cover crop to go to seed,
2) shred it down in late spring (rather than disking it under),
and 3) after the first substantial fall rain, run a springtooth
harrow lightly through the middle.  
<P>
Where drip irrigation is used, the cover crops of choice are perennial
native grass mixes, such as Molate fescue, Idaho fescue, and pine
bluegrass.  The perennial grass species used are summer obligate
dormant, which means that they do not compete or compete only
minimally with the vines for water and nutrients during the critical
late spring/summer months.  Overhead sprinkler irrigation gives
the grower the flexibility of planting either the annual or perennial
cover crops noted above.  For vineyards with very heavy or very
sandy soil, or where a hardpan is present, Culver recommends Merced
rye or barley to help improve these soils.
<P>
Regardless of the cover crop species used, Culver recommends that
growers create a good seedbed and pre-irrigate where possible
for best results.  Depending on the time of seeding, a pre-plant
irrigation may be the only irrigation needed.  Culver also strongly
recommends that growers monitor the nutritional status of the
vines, especially nitrogen, since cover crops are capable of either
adding or removing nitrogen from the soil.
<P><CENTER>
<IMG VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20 SRC="images/dennis.gif" ALT="Image: Dennis Culver">
</CENTER><P>
Other mixes are also being used by growers in the Lodi area. 
Some growers have planted various insectary blends, which contain
species attractive to beneficial insects and spiders.  A number
of these mixes have proven largely unsuccessful in this location
because the species and/or seeding rates of the mixes create a
stand which is poorly competitive with cool-season weeds.  Also,
it has been difficult to judge whether these mixes are attracting
sufficient beneficials to significantly reduce leafhopper and
mite populations.
<P>
Several growers have planted California native perennial grasses.
 Randy Lange of Lange Twins has planted over 300 acres of vineyard
to a mix of various native grasses.  Initially concerned about
the effects of dust (from tillage) on mite predators and parasitoids,
he first started using resident vegetation (&quot;weeds&quot;)
as the ground cover.  However, some of the weed species became
unmanageable and many became very competitive with the vines for
water and nutrients.  He had seen some vineyards planted to native
grasses, which formed a dense cover and did not appear to compete
with the vines.
<P>
To prepare the soil for planting native grasses after harvest,
Lange applied two tons per acre of compost and then disked twice.
 In order to level the ground as much as possible during the first
disking, he placed a triangular-shaped drag implement behind the
disk to fill in the furrows created by the disk.  Two weeks after
the first disking, which tilled to a depth of six inches, he sprayed
Roundup&reg; on the berms to control the germinating weeds.  The
second disking was shallower, to prevent the soil from fluffing
up too much, and included the use of a ring roller behind the
disk to pack the seedbed before planting.  In late October, he
planted the seed blend at a rate of 20 pounds per acre.  He calibrated
the Truax drill (currently the only drill that can plant native
grasses properly) frequently because he wanted to ensure uniform
seeding and because of the high cost of the seed.  He then sprinkle-irrigated
the vineyard for three hours, and did not enter the vineyard until
it was mowed in late winter.  The berms were immediately treated
with Roundup&reg; in early March.  Before mowing, weeds dominated
the stand and had him worried.  But after mowing, the thin green
lines of the drilled grasses were clearly visible.  No further
irrigation was needed until early April.  Lange admits he doesn't
yet know the drawbacks involved with this mix, but he thinks the
benefits will outweigh the risks.

<H1>Community Food Systems in California</H1>

<P>
<I>By <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff5.html">David Campbell</A> and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff7.html">Gail Feenstra</A>, SAREP</I>
<P>
Sustainable agriculture has made great strides in developing agricultural
production practices more in harmony with the ecology of particular
places. While progress continues on this front, a new and more
complex challenge beckons: developing community food systems which
integrate production, distribution and consumption patterns to
sustain the economic and social life of particular regions. Examples
include researchers at Wisconsin's Center for Integrated Agricultural
Systems who are identifying regionally specific biological control
products that can promote small business creation; participants
in the Hartford (Conn.) Food System who create direct marketing
links that sustain farms and improve nutrition in low-income communities;
and students and administrators at Hendrix College (Ark.) who
have dramatically increased the College's purchases of locally
grown food.
<P>
<IMG HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=right SRC="images/eggs.gif" ALT="Image: placer county eggs">

Projects such as these give concrete expression to traditional
sustainable agriculture concerns for rural community development,
social responsibility, and an improved quality of life. Participants
are motivated by desires to limit community dependency on an unstable
global economy, to create jobs and enhance the local economy,
and to satisfy the growing hunger for a more direct and empowering
connection to the food they eat. The aim is not complete local
self-sufficiency, but a move in a direction that combines equitable
trade with a primary focus on increasing the local community's
self-reliance and food security. 
<P>
Projects to develop sustainable community food systems typically
encompass at least one of the following goals and are consistent
with all six: 1) insuring access by all community members to an
adequate, affordable diet of high nutritional value; 2) developing
and maintaining a stable base of family farms using production
practices which are less chemical and energy-intensive; 3) creating
marketing practices which directly link farmers and consumers
and reduce the resources used to move food between production
and consumption; 4) starting ag-related businesses that create
jobs, reduce leakage of dollars from the community or in other
ways contribute to the community's economic development; 5) improving
working and living conditions of farm labor such that farmers
and farmworkers can be fully contributing members of the community;
and 6) implementing public policies that encourage a community's
transition to sustainable agriculture by protecting farmland,
developing necessary infrastructure, and providing research and
technical assistance.
<P>
In California, several SAREP-funded projects exhibit unique features
of community food systems. These include PlacerGrown, a county-wide
cooperative agricultural marketing program; the <A HREF="http://www.knobul.com:80/knobul/aef.html">Arcata Farm and Education Project</A> , a student-run community farm in the city of
Arcata; and a Community-Supported Agriculture/ Farmers' Market
Project in a low-income neighborhood of Los Angeles.
<P>
PlacerGrown is an example of how broad-based community planning
can find creative ways to sustain agriculture and contribute to
a county's long-term economic development. The objectives of this
non-profit agricultural marketing organization are to expand the
demand for locally grown and processed foods; to increase agricultural
production, profitability and opportunity; and to enhance the
community's quality of life. A marketing plan has been developed
by a group which includes Cooperative Extension, cattle and sheep
ranchers, fruit and vegetable growers, farmers' market representatives,
and the Office of Economic Development. Among the specific activities
pursued are producer and consumer surveys to determine what both
groups need to support a more regionally based food system; a
consumer education campaign called &quot;A Reason for the Season&quot;
to identify how nutritional needs can be met by eating locally
available foods in season; and training programs aimed at increasing
use of local foods by restaurants, institutional food services,
grocery stores and community groups. The project, now in its second
year, includes a plan to disseminate its model through a manual/report,
slide sets and presentations.
<P>
The Arcata Farm and Education Project demonstrates how a small
project can spark creative connections that promote a more sustainable
community food system. The two-acre, student-run community farm
is the result of cooperation between Humboldt State University,
Cooperative Extension, local farmers and educators, and the city
of Arcata. The project has five major objectives: to use the farm
as an educational facility to teach university students about
sustainable small farm management skills; to operate the farm
as a CSA (community supported agriculture) or subscription farm;
to develop and incorporate curriculum for local elementary and
high schools; to facilitate communication about agriculture in
the community by involving local farmers, refugee farmers and
community members in classes and activities at the farm; and to
give community youth groups access to the facility as a place
to experiment with animal husbandry and sustainable agriculture
projects. A manual, a slide set, and possibly a video are being
developed that will describe the farm's activities, how it has
overcome problems, and lessons for other communities.
<P>
The Los Angeles CSA/ Farmers' Market Project is an example of
how the community food system vision can be addressed in a large
urban area. A 1993 study of the Los Angeles food system conducted
by the UCLA Department of Urban Planning found that many inner
city residents are unable to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet,
while at the same time small farmers close to metropolitan areas
were struggling to remain economically viable. The project addresses
both problems simultaneously by organizing a subscription farming
program in which farmers at the Gardena Farmers' Market sell shares
of produce to inner city households or institutions on a weekly,
monthly or seasonal basis. The project is now in the process of
investigating how food stamps can be used to purchase food through
this type of community supported agriculture project. Neighborhood
residents or local food service institutions should be able to
purchase fresh, local produce through the CSA arrangement as early
as the summer of 1995.
<P>
As in any new area of research and community development, much
conceptual and practical work remains to be done, and many questions
have yet to be answered. It remains to be seen how quickly and
extensively community food systems can be developed, and how appropriate
they will be to all regions, or all farmers. By funding a variety
of community food system projects, SAREP hopes to help find answers
that work for California.

<P>
UC SAREP is required by the California Legislature's 1986 Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education Act to have both public and
technical advisory committees to advise the program on its goals
and make recommendations on its  competitive grant awards.  The
Public Advisory Committee (PAC) includes individuals actively
involved in agricultural production, as well as representatives
from government, public organizations, and institutions of higher
education.  The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) is made up
of California university and college faculty and staff with knowledge
and experience related to sustainable agriculture.  Each PAC or
TAC members serves for three years.  New members in 1995 are listed
below.

<H3>Groundwater Contamination</H3>

<P>
<I>Pesticide Contamination of Groundwater in California</I>, published
by the School of Public Health at the University of California,
Berkeley, assesses the role pesticide use plays in degrading California's
groundwater and evaluates efforts to protect it.  Groundwater
supplies 60 percent of large public drinking water systems and
80 percent of small water systems in the state.  Some Central
Valley communities obtain 100 percent of their water supply from
groundwater, while Los Angeles receives only 17 percent of its
supply from groundwater.  Using data from California's pesticide
monitoring programs, this report examines the extent of pesticide-related
contamination and resulting environmental health risks. The report
outlines the challenge for policy analysts regarding groundwater
pollution: Why hasn't information on pesticides with the highest
leaching potential and geographic areas that are vulnerable to
groundwater contamination been incorporated into more effective,
prevention-oriented strategies?  It includes tables of the top
ten pesticides detected in well water, an evaluation of management
strategies, and suggestions about tax liability incentives to
prevent groundwater contamination. Copies of the report are $20
with checks payable to &quot;UC Regents,&quot; from the California
Policy Seminar, 2020 Milvia St., Suite 412, Berkeley, CA 94704;

<P>
Article written for Sustainable Agriculture Technical Reviews.
1995 
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Cover crops are being studied because they may have substantial
effects on several components of agroecosystems. In various locations
cover crops have been used to enhance the natural control of arthropod
pests, to suppress weeds, and as an alternative to synthetic nitrogen
fertilizer. These uses of cover crops are usually examined independently,
but there is reason to consider the interactions among them as
well. In fact, cover crops can impact agroecosystems through a
number of pathways, both direct and indirect (figure 1). If ,
for example, cover crops affect the nutritional quality (and water
status) of crop plants, then we should expect these effects to
also impact the performance of herbivores feeding on the crop
plant, since plant nutrient and water status can significantly
affect population dynamics of herbivores (Slansky and Rodriguez,
1987; Dale, 1988). Moreover, these indirect effects may increase
incrementally through time, as the cover crop system undergoes
a transition phase. A long- term, comprehensive assessment of
the role of cover crops in crop production is necessary if we
are to understand and successfully utilize them for arthropod,
weed, and crop-nutrition management.
<P>
The research reported in this article assessed the value of cover
crops in vineyard pest and nutrition management. Four experiments
helped us determine the effect of various vineyard floor management
systems on: 1) two species of leafhoppers, the variegated grape
leafhopper (Erythroneura variabilis Beamer), and the western grape
leafhopper (Erythroneura elegantula Osborn), which are major pests
of grapevines in the San Joaquin Valley (Flaherty et al., 1992);
2) weed suppression and the need for soil-applied herbicides;
3) vine-nutrient status and the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizer;
and 4) vine growth, and grape yield and quality. We also developed
a partial budget for each system.
<H3>Experimental Design and Cultural Methods</H3>

<P>
<B>Fowler and Earlimart sites</B>. Two experiments were initiated
in 1992 comparing three vineyard floor management systems: 1)
a 'conventional' clean-cultivated system with chemical weed suppression
in row berms, 2) a fall-planted, oat-vetch cover crop mix which
was mowed and placed on row berms for weed suppression without
the use of soil-applied herbicides, and 3) a fall-planted, oat-vetch
cover that was mowed and placed in row middles, with complete
chemical weed control in row berms. These systems were compared
at two locations: a 60-acre 'Thompson Seedless' vineyard located
about eight miles west of Fowler (Fresno County), and a 33-acre
'Thompson Seedless' vineyard located about ten miles east of Earlimart
(Tulare County). In both cover crop systems, the cover was mowed
twice and then allowed to re-seed before soil incorporation, which
typically occurred in early July at the Fowler site, and October
at the Earlimart site. All systems were clean-cultivated for the
remainder of the season at the Fowler site (a raisin grape vineyard),
while a ground cover was maintained during the summer by per-iodic
mowing of resident vegetation in all plots at the Earlimart site
(a table grape vineyard).
<P><CENTER>

</CENTER><P>

<P>
Insecticide and miticide use differed between the Fowler and Earlimart
sites. At the Fowler site, a low rate of Omite (two pounds per
acre) was applied on 14 June, 1993 to control an outbreak of Pacific
spider mite (Tetranychus pacificus McGregor). No other miticides
or insecticides were applied for leafhopper and mite control at
any other time during the experiment. At the Earlimart site, Pyrenone
was applied in late May 1992 and 1993, and Lannate was applied
in mid-August 1993, despite low numbers of leafhoppers. In 1994,
the vineyard operator withheld insecticide applications for leafhopper
control. Miticides were not used at any time during the experiments
at the Earlimart site, where spider mites generally occurred in
low densities.
<P>
Soil amendments also differed between the two sites. All plots
at the Earlimart site received a yearly application of four tons
per acre of steer manure in the fall, and two tons per acre of
gypsum in June. At the Fowler site, all plots received 75 pounds
of nitrogen per acre in June 1992, and four tons per acre of steer
manure in October 1992. During the 1993 season, we added fertilized
and unfertilized subplots to each treatment. Fertilized subplots
received 75 pounds nitrogen per acre in June, and unfertilized
plots did not receive any nitrogen fertilizer. The same design
was maintained during the 1994 season, but nitrogen fertilizer
was not added as vine nitrogen levels were adequate in all treatments.
<P>
<B>Kearney and Madera sites.</B> In 1993 we initiated two additional
experiments using a Merced rye and vetch cover crop mix: one in
a two-acre 'Thompson Seedless' vineyard located at the University
of California Kearney Agricultural Center (Parlier, Calif.), and
the other in a 53-acre commercial 'Thompson Seedless' vineyard
located near Madera, Calif. The Kearney experiment compared a
clean-cultivated system with a system that used the cover crop
as dry mulch for partial weed suppression on row berms. The Madera
experiment compared a clean-cultivated system with two cover crop
systems: one in which the cover was mowed and incorporated as
green manure in early April, and another <BR>
in which the cover crop was mowed once (also in early April) and
then allowed to re-seed before incorporation in early July.
<P>
Insecticides and miticides were not used for leafhopper or mite
control in the Kearney and Madera sites. Fertilizer was not added
at the Kearney site, since the irrigation water at the UC Kearney
Agricultural Center normally supplies vines with approximately
20 pounds of nitrogen per acre. All plots in the Madera vineyard
received 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre in June 1993, but fertilizer
was not added in 1994.
<H3>Sampling</H3>

<P>
We used several sampling methods (direct observations, sticky
traps, D-Vac, sweep net, pitfall traps and vine shakes) to estimate
the abundance of leafhoppers and their natural enemies (spiders
and other generalist predators, and egg parasitoids) on vines
and on the cover crops. In general, sampling of cover crops was
conducted from March until plow down, while grape vines were sampled
from May through September or mid-October. Controlled shoot-cage
experiments were also conducted in 1993 at the Madera site, and
in 1994 at the Fowler, Kearney, and Madera sites. The purpose
of these cage experiments was to determine the impact of each
treatment on leafhopper reproduction and survivorship in the absence
of the actions of their natural enemies. We also conducted trace-element
marking experiments in the Madera vineyard during the 1993 and
1994 seasons, to further determine the impact of cover crops on
leafhoppers and spiders.
<P>
The effect of berm mulching with cover crop biomass on weed suppression
was assessed at the Earlimart, Fowler and Kearney vineyards. Prior
to each mowing and in the middle of summer, we determined weed
species frequency, percent cover and total biomass on berms, and
percent of berm area covered with mulch residues. Weed suppression
was evaluated at each time by identifying and counting plant species
using four 100-foot transects, and counting plants at each foot.
<P>
We used leaf petioles to determine vine nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium status at two stages of vine growth: full bloom
and beginning of berry ripening (veraison). At harvest, we estimated
berry size and sugar content (all vineyards), pH and titratable
acidity (Earlimart vineyard), and raisin yield and quality (Fowler,
Kearney and Madera vineyards).
<H3>Results and Discussion</H3>

<P>
<B>Leafhoppers.</B> Our findings to date indicate that, if properly
managed, winter legume/grass cover crops can reduce leafhopper
abundance. Where leafhopper numbers were not very low and cover
crops were properly maintained through early July, reduced infestations
of leafhoppers were observed in the presence of cover crops. These
reductions may be attributed in part to enhanced activity of certain
groups of spiders, which are consistently found at higher densities
in the presence of cover crops compared to the clean-cultivated
systems. Trace-element marking of cover crops indicated that cover
crops may also influence leafhopper populations by serving as
non-host vegetation which interferes with their movement patterns
and perhaps other aspects of their life history (Hanna et al.,
unpublished data). Although cover crops may affect vine physiology
(through changes in soil fertility, soil-water status, etc.),
which may in turn affect leafhopper biology, the changes we have
observed in vine conditions to date were not sufficient to explain
the differences in leafhopper abundance observed between the cover
crop and clean-cultivated treatments. Cage data indicated that
leafhopper reproduction and survivorship in the absence of predation
were not affected by cover crop treatment. 
<P>
<B>Vine Nutrition. </B>The effect of cover crops on vine-nutrient
status varied between years and vineyards. Cover crops produced
positive effects on vine nutrient status by the second or third
year if the cover crops were well-managed, but produced negative
effects if the cover or vineyard was poorly managed. The positive
effects were usually delayed, and were best illustrated by the
results from our Fowler site where by the third year, nitrogen
levels (nitrate-N in petioles) in unfertilized cover cropped vines
were similar to nitrogen levels in fertilized clean-cultivated
vines, independent of the type of weed management in row berms.
Potassium levels were also enhanced by cover crops by the third
year at the Fowler site. We have not observed these effects in
the Earlimart vineyard where the cover crop was not incorporated
until fall, while weeds were allowed to grow in row middles during
the summer. Under this system of ground cover management, much
of the nutrient content of the cover is apparently either lost
by volatilization, or used to grow the resident vegetation during
the summer. At the Kearney and Madera sites (second year), although
we have not detected statistically significant changes in vine-nutrient
status in the cover crop treatments compared to clean-cultivated
treatments, we have observed non-significant trends toward higher
levels of nitrogen and potassium in vines associated with cover
crops compared to clean-cultivated vines. Based on results from
the Fowler site, we expect to see higher levels of nitrogen and
potassium in cover crop treatments at the Kearney and Madera sites
during the third and later years, since the impact of cover crops
on vine nutrient status is often delayed and may not be statistically
significant during the transition phase.
<P>
<B>Weeds.</B> The amount of dry biomass produced by cover crops
for weed suppression varied between vineyards. During late winter
and early spring, the mulched berms received 1,800 to 8,726 pounds
of dry biomass per acre, with a total nitrogen content of 33 to
109 pounds per acre. Results to date from the San Joaquin Valley
sites and from a north coast study  indicate that with sufficient
levels of biomass production, berm mulching should reduce the
use of pre-emergence herbicides. The mulch, however, will not
control all weeds equally. Perennial weeds such as field bindweed
were not controlled.
<P>
Yield. The effects of cover crops on grape yield and operating
costs depended on grape culture, and represented a trade-off in
water, fertilizer, pesticide and resource use. Although significant
differences in yields have not been realized in the Earlimart
(third year) and Madera (second year) vineyards, berry weight
and raisin yields were significantly higher by the second year
at the Kearney site where cover crop biomass was used as dry mulch
for weed suppression in row berms. Berry weight was also significantly
greater by the third year in cover crop compared to clean-cultivated
treatments at the Fowler site. Greater berry weights should have
translated into greater raisin weights, but this effect could
not be measured as the raisins at the Fowler site were badly damaged
by early fall rain. The partial cost budget indicated that the
use of cover crops (despite greater water demand) may significantly
reduce operating costs if savings were realized by reducing chemical
inputs for insects and mites. These savings are expected to increase
if cultural methods (e.g., raised beds with adjacent furrows for
irrigation are used instead of flood irrigation) are modified
to maintain satisfactory cover crop growth while reducing water
use.
<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
Despite these encouraging results, some critical questions remain
to be addressed in order to assess the long term impact of cover
crops on several elements of grape production. At present we do
not know what impact these cover crop systems will ultimately
have on several aspects of soil fertility and water use in vineyards.
For example, we do not know if the increased yields at the Kearney
and Fowler sites were due to the greater amount of water used
to grow the cover crop. In this case, water usage should be controlled
as an experimental variable so we can understand why higher yields
were obtained in the presence of cover crops.
<P>
Studies of more than three-year duration are needed to adequately
determine the complex relationships between cover crops, arthropod
pests, and weeds, and to evaluate their impact on soil fertility,
vine nutrition, and vineyard water use. Our hypothesis is that
benefits of cover crops to grapevines will increase incrementally
through time, and can be measured. We are continuing our research
in the Fowler, Kearney, and Madera sites, and have initiated a
similar study in Napa. We are expanding our multidisciplinary
expertise to include a soil scientist (Dr. R. Miller) and a grape
physiologist (Dr. L. Williams).

<H1>Survey of annual crop growers regarding cover crops. </H1>

<P>
Summary of Final Report to UC Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program. 1994 
<P>
This detailed survey was designed to collect information from
annual crop growers that would help focus future research and
extension efforts regarding the use of cover crops in field and
vegetable crop systems. Participants in the survey were selected
through a three step process. First, a list of all tomato and
safflower growers in the year prior to the survey was obtained
from the County Agricultural Commissioners in each of five counties
(Yolo, Solano, Sutter, San Joaquin, Colusa). Second, a random
sample of 200 growers was selected from this list and combined
with a targeted list of 48 producers in the five counties who
were thought to be using cover crops. From this combined list
of 248 growers, 119 agreed to participate in the telephone interview.
<P>
Survey participants were asked about cover crop usage, and their
perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of cover crops. The
results give a clearer picture of the current status of cover
cropping in annual cropping systems in California, the types of
practices currently in use for managing cover crops in these systems,
the barriers to more extensive adoption of cover cropping, and
areas in need of further research and extension activities. Tables
1 and 2 summarize some of the key findings from the survey.
<H3>Barriers to the Use of Cover Crops</H3>

<P>
Thirty-four of the 119 growers surveyed used cover crops. The
main reasons cited for not growing cover crops were that: 1) the
cover crop could not be incorporated in time for spring planting,
2) a cash crop with a direct economic benefit could be planted
instead, and 3) the overall cost of growing the cover crop was
too high (including seed, labor, equipment, fuel, and water costs).
Those who grew cover crops responded similarly when asked why
they didn't use cover crops on more of their land, noting problems
with timing and economics. Those who grew cover crops and those
who did not had very similar perceptions about the potential disadvantages
of growing a cover crop. In addition to the three problems discussed
above, farmers also mentioned increases in harmful insect populations,
and tillage complications due to cover crop residue.

</PRE>

<P>
The survey data indicate that one of the major barriers to adoption
of cover cropping in annual systems, especially among conventional
farmers, is that they are not convinced that the benefits of cover
cropping outweigh the costs. The two perceived benefits most often
mentioned by farmers not currently growing cover crops were increases
in soil organic matter and the addition of nitrogen to the soil
and crops, benefits that can be obtained through means other than
cover cropping (e.g., compost, manure, conventional fertilizers).
It was interesting to note that many other potential benefits
of cover cropping, mentioned by the cover crop growers, were apparently
unknown or unappreciated by those who did not grow cover crops.
These include: increased beneficial insects, reduced weed problems,
increased water holding capacity, increased nutrient availability
to the following crop, and reduced soil compaction.
<H3>Research and Information Needs</H3>

<P>
Growers' responses to questions about research and education needs
indicated two areas where information is most needed: 1) New or
existing cover crop varieties that can fit into a particular type
of crop rotation, grow well in a particular soil or weather conditions,
or possess certain characteristics (such as high biomass, fast
growth, extensive root system or high nitrogen content), and 2)
the effects of cover crops on various aspects of the farming system,
such as soil structure, soil fertility, insect populations, and
weed composition. Other categories included economic information,
such as cost-benefit analyses, and operational information, such
as different types of equipment and best times for planting and
incorporating the cover crops.

<H1>Reflective mulches repel aphids and protect cucurbitaceous
crops from virus diseases. </H1>

<P>
<I>James J. Stapleton, Charles G. Summers, Roger A. Duncan and
Albert S. Newton </I>
<P>
Adapted from Plant Protection Quarterly 5(1):4-5. 1995 
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Virus diseases carried by aphids can hinder the production of
cucurbits (e.g., melons, squash, cucumbers) in California. Aphid
feeding causes some direct damage to the plant, but the loss due
to disease is far greater. Numerous studies have shown that reflective
mulches covering the soil can repel aphids and delay or reduce
the incidence of non-persistent virus diseases in susceptible
vegetable crops. The lack of suitable materials for mulching impeded
adoption of this practice in California up until a few years ago.
<P>
A number of silver polyethylene mulches are now commercially available
and have been used with some success. This film must be removed
and properly disposed of in order to prepare the ground for the
following crop. Another material being explored, but not yet commercially
available, is water-soluble, biodegradable synthetic latex spray
mulch. This product can be applied more economically than polyethylene
films, and can simply be incorporated into the soil after harvest.
This report details field experiments to compare the effects of
reflective spray mulch and plastic film products in repelling
aphids, delaying the onset of virus disease, and increasing yield
of zucchini squash and cantaloupes.
<H3>Materials and Methods</H3>

<P>
Replicated field experiments were conducted for two years (1993
and 1994) near Fresno, California from August to October, and
compared silver-painted spray mulch (Styrofan, BASF Corp.) with
several silver and white pigmented plastic film mulches. Experimental
sites were pre-irrigated, fertilized and treated with pre-plant
herbicides according to standard practices for the area. Treatments
consisted of 5-6 replications, 3.1 x 7.6 meters. Plots were separated
by fallow areas 3.1 meters wide. Each plot was three beds wide.
The center bed was used as the data row, with a guard row on either
side. Treatments in the 1993 zucchini experiment included two
silver polyethylene films, white polyethylene film, silver nylon
film and silver nylon net mulch, silver-painted spray mulch and
white spray mulch, no mulch with two applications of the insecticide
diazinon to plant foliage, and a non-mulched control.
<P>
Planting holes were made in the mulches, and zucchini squash (<I>Cucurbita
pepo var. melopepo</I> vv. sunre 7918) was seeded on August 3.
After emergence, the crop was raised according to standard cultural
practices. Plants were rated for appearance of first foliar symptoms
of virus disease infection at the first squash harvest, and one
and two weeks following the first harvest. Plants were picked
12 times, about every other day. Squash were rated for marketability
(size and presence or absence of virus symptoms) and yield. Procedures
for the 1994 cantaloupe experiment were similar, except that treatments
included complete bed coverage (1.7 meters) with silver polyethylene
mulch; complete, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent bed coverage
with silver spray mulch; and the nontreated control. Melons were
harvested three times.
<H3>Results and Discussion</H3>

<P>
1993 Squash. Cotton/melon aphid (<I>Aphis gossypii</I>) were found
on squash plants shortly after emergence. On the date of first
squash harvest, foliar virus symptoms were visible on more than
95 percent of the plants grown on bare soil, with or without insecticide
sprays. White-colored spray or plastic mulches gave moderate (36-42%)
relief from virus infection , while only seven to 17 percent of
plants grown on silver-colored spray or plastic mulches exhibited
symptoms (figure 1). Suppression of foliar virus symptoms was
not documented after the fourth picking. Multiple infection by
zucchini yellows mosaic (ZuYMV), watermelon mosaic-2 (WaMV), and
cucumber mosaic (CMV) viruses occurred in the field. Infection
by watermelon mosaic-1 or squash mosaic viruses was not detected,
and cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) was not tested.
<P>
All mulch treatments allowed significant (P &lt; 0.05), 3- to
5- fold increases in cumulative, marketable yield of squash, as
compared to the non-mulched controls. The silver spray mulch was
as effective as silver polyethylene (figure 2). Early infection
of control plants drastically reduced their ability to produce
fruit, and the plants were essentially nonproductive.
<P>
1994 Cantaloupe Melon. As in the squash experiment, aphid populations
and virus pressure were high from the time the plants emerged.
Non-mulched plants were nearly 100 percent infected with CMV,
WaMV, and ZuYMV prior to the first harvest. Mulched plots did
not approach 100 percent infection until six weeks later. All
mulch treatments gave large increases in yield, ranging from 4-fold
(25 percent bed coverage) to 25-fold (polyethylene 100 percent
bed coverage). The mulch treatments gave early protection to the
emerging and developing squash plants, allowing production of
a marketable crop which otherwise would not have been possible.
<P>
<CENTER>
<A HREF="apendix1.htm">Figures one and two</A>
</CENTER>

<H3>Conclusions</H3>
<P>
The results of this work, conducted under conditions of severe
aphid and virus pressure, indicated that sprayable mulches can
be as effective as plastic film mulches in reducing disease losses.
Additional studies to refine biological and economic considerations
of using spray mulch for virus suppression in vegetable crops
are currently underway.

<H1>A dietary, social and economic evaluation of the Philadelphia
<BR>
urban gardening project. </H1>

<I>Dorothy Blair, Carol C. Giesecke and Sandra Sherman </I>

Journal of Nutrition Education 23(4): 161-167. 1991 
<P>
Urban gardening has been widely promoted as a strategy for improving
the food security of people in inner cities, particularly in low
income areas. This study evaluates the nutritional, social and
economic contributions of the Philadelphia Urban Gardening Project,
one of the country's largest urban gardens. Sponsored by the Pennsylvania
State University Cooperative Extension and the Philadelphia Horticultural
Society, the project involves 560 sites and nearly 5,000 families,
including the urban poor, the elderly and diverse ethnic groups.
<H3>Methods</H3>

<P>
One hundred forty-four gardeners (40 black, 40 Korean, 40 white
and 24 Hispanic) were selected from a stratified random sample
of 64 selected sites throughout the city. Sixty-seven non-gardening
controls (21 black, 20 Korean, 20 white and 6 Hispanic) were selected
from nearby neighborhoods using the same ethnic and geographic
criteria as the gardeners. Trained interviewers conducted oral
surveys with study participants at either their gardens or their
homes from July 1987 to November 1987. Survey participants were
asked how frequently they consumed various foods during the previous
month, specifically, 23 categories of vegetables, six categories
of fruits, and six other categories of food. Additional questions
addressed vegetable use in meals and four questions measured life
satisfaction. The potential yields of 151 garden plots were estimated
based on a scale of very good (90 percent of potential yield)
to poor (25 percent of potential yield). Early harvest yields
were not estimated for 100 plots due to a delay in recruiting
gardener subjects. The market value of the vegetables and fruits
in these gardens was estimated using the assessed potential yield
and the 1987-1988 dollar market value for each food item.
<H3>Results </H3>

<P>
Description of gardeners and controls. A demographic comparison
of gardeners and controls found that gardeners were significantly
older than controls (60.3 years vs. 45.5 years) and had a lower
mean education. Gardeners were longer-time Philadelphia residents
than non-gardeners and had also lived in their neighborhoods significantly
longer. Gardeners had maintained their plots a mean of 4.1 years,
working about 11.7 hours per week in the gardens, yet over half
(51%) had never gardened before the 1987 season. On average, gardeners
ate fresh produce from the garden for five months of the year
with almost 10 percent harvesting vegetables all year. Sixty-two
percent preserved food from their gardens by freezing, canning
or drying. Home preserved food was consumed for an average of
7.2 months of the year. Additional produce was shared with neighbors
and relatives, often on a weekly basis and more than 40 percent
of gardeners shared produce with a church or community organization.
<P>
Gardeners were motivated to garden for several reasons including
recreation (21%), mental health (19%), physical health/exercise
(17%_especially the Korean population), produce quality/nutrition
(14%_especially the black and white populations), spiritual reasons/contact
with nature (10%), self-fulfillment (7%) and cost/convenience
(7%). The authors note that quality of life issues outweighed
the economic benefits of gardening for these gardeners.
<P>
<B>Nutritional contributions.</B> Gardeners consumed significantly
more of six vegetable categories than non-gardeners, including
cole crops, okra/eggplants, sweet and hot peppers, summer squashes,
tomatoes and herbs. Their vegetable consumption frequency was
also almost always higher than controls. Gardeners, however, consumed
less fruit, especially citrus fruits and juices, than controls.
They also consumed less milk products, sweets and sweet drinks.
Gardeners and non-gardeners ate similar amounts of vegetables;
however, gardeners were more likely to eat vegetables in meatless
meals (vs. side dishes, salads, stews and snacks).
<P>
<B>Community participation/life satisfaction.</B> Gardeners were
more likely than controls to regard their neighbors as friendly.
They were also significantly more likely to participate in food
distribution projects, neighborhood clean-ups and neighborhood
social events. Gardeners gave significantly more positive responses
to questions on psychosocial well-being and frequency of meaningful
life events.
<P>
<B>Garden plot evaluations. </B>Average garden plantings yielded
77 percent of their potential with a mean of 8.1 plant species
per garden. The mean economic value of the 151 plots was $161
per year. The authors note this was likely an underestimate since
early plantings and flowers were not included. Gardeners spent
an average of $47 per person on plants, inputs and fencing, thus
netting $113 after expenses.
<P>
<B>Ethnic differences.</B> Each ethnic group tended to regard
their community gardens differently. According to the authors,
the older gardens, mainly in black neighborhoods, served as social
centers; smaller, newer Hispanic gardens were sources of pride;
the Korean gardens provided social cohesion as the gardeners worked
together on their plots; and whites tended to garden in larger
sites distant from their neighborhoods.
<H3>Conclusions</H3>

<P>
Low income, inner city residents may find it difficult to obtain
fresh produce due to a lack of availability or high cost in small
neighborhood stores, the exodus of large supermarkets and a lack
of adequate transportation. This study finds that access to community
gardens is an important strategy for improving vegetable consumption,
gaining control over the quality and variety of produce consumed,
and facilitating community relationships and development. The
authors conclude that urban gardening is related to an increased
frequency of vegetable consumption and a decrease in dairy, sweets
and sweet drink consumption. Cole crops may have provided some
of the calcium that gardeners did not get from dairy products;
however, nutrition advice that encourages foods high in calcium
would benefit these gardeners.
<P>
<I>Reviewer's Comment.</I> Community gardens provide an alternative
for people in low income communities to simultaneously improve
food security and their participation in a local food system.
For low income families, urban gardens are a potential source
of fresh, nutritious produce at relatively low cost. These benefits
take on greater significance in light of recent debate at the
national level about government food programs. Urban gardens also
provide a focal point for people to come together in community
and build neighborhood relationships at a time when disappearing
resources put a strain on inner city families.

<H1><A NAME="DDE_LINK13"><U><I>From the Director</I></U> - The
Urban/Agricultural Recycle Connection</A></H1>

<P>
Farmers, gardeners and scientists are familiar with recycling.
 They know that using microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi
as decomposers is key to the recycling of organic material.  Linking
rural and urban wastes and using the composting knowledge found
on farms may be a way to help us &quot;get out from under&quot;
the problem of our waste disposal and make society, as well as
agriculture, more sustainable.
<P>
 
<P>
Although all systems generate waste, some wastes are easier to
manage than others. The management of waste from modern industrial
systems is becoming more complex and expensive as landfills reach
capacity. Noting this, the California Legislature passed the Integrated
Waste Management Act (AB 939) in 1989, which gave communities
responsibility for waste reduction and recycling. The bill required
that by 1995, 25 percent of a community's total solid waste stream
must be diverted from landfills through source reduction, recycling
and composting. According to officials at the California Integrated
Waste Management Board (CIWMB), that goal will be met.  California
cities, like those throughout the nation, have increased their
recycling efforts. The City of Davis last year recycled 36 percent
of its waste, Lodi recycled 32 percent, while San Jose diverted
45 percent of its residential waste from landfills.
<P>
 
<P>
<B>Howard Levenson, </B>a CIWMB staff member, notes that the Integrated
Waste Management Act's second goal, to reduce waste by half by
the year 2000, will be a challenge for local governments, California
businesses, consumers and the CIWMB.  He said the focus will be
on waste prevention (i.e., helping businesses reduce waste while
saving money, and increasing backyard composting), and developing
greater markets for materials such as yard and wood debris, paper,
plastics, and construction and demolition debris.  The 28 percent
of the waste stream that can be composted-yard, food and wood
waste-may be used on farms.
<P>
In order to stimulate composting markets for urban waste, the
CIWMB has funded five two-year compost/mulch demonstration projects.
 Projects selected involve cooperative teams working in Fresno,
Tulare, Stanislaus, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties on the
use of composted orchard, cotton, grape and vegetable residue.
 Each team is comprised of farm operators, UCCE farm advisors
and other technical experts, compost/mulch processors, and representatives
of local government.  Participating farm advisors and UC researchers
include <B>Harry Andris, </B>Fresno County; <B>Carol Frate, </B>Tulare
County; <B>Craig Kolodge, </B>Santa Clara County; <B>Jesus Valencia
</B>and <B>Ed Perry, </B>Stanislaus County; and <B>Marc Buchanan,
</B>UC Santa Cruz.  The goal is to promote the use of municipally
derived mulch or compost in commercial agriculture.  Information
from the projects won't be available until the end of 1996, but
enthusiasm is high.  Additionally, other farm advisors throughout
the state are involved in waste management projects funded by
the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
<P>
Since California soils are characteristically low in organic material,
it is hoped that these projects will show that the following benefits
can be obtained from compost products: increased soil organic
matter; greater numbers of soil microbes; better soil moisture
retention; a decrease in the leaching of soil nutrients; and a
reduced need for commercial fertilizer to sustain crop reduction.
<P>
Agriculture is also continuing to find new ways to recycle its
own wastes.  Until recently, for example, almond processors were
able to sell most of their almond shell waste to biomass power
plants.  However, almond processors are now receiving lower returns
from shell sales due to changing regulations in both the electrical
utility and waste management sectors.  Faced with this situation,
processors representing a significant portion of the industry
have contracted with agAccess Information Service in Davis to
identify and evaluate potential alternative uses for shells. 
Such uses may include direct application as a mulch in orchards
and vineyards, and as a compost when combined with poultry or
livestock waste.  On a related note, increasing numbers of farmers
are leaving prunings in the orchards and chipping them on site,
eliminating the need for burning.
<P>
Animal agriculture systems in California are also big contributors
of organic waste material.  Manure from the state's animal production
totals 250 million pounds per day from approximately 300 million
animals, according to UC Davis Animal Systems Management Specialist
Jim Oltjen.  At a recent conference on the impact of animal agriculture
on California water quality, several speakers noted that California
livestock operations are larger and more concentrated than in
other states, and our limited water supplies make this an important
agriculture waste issue (See &quot;Agricultural Animals and California's
Water,&quot; page 5.)  Farmers, ranchers and regulators are working
to find creative solutions for potentially valuable manure waste.
<P>
Various sectors of society will play different roles in our efforts
to manage wastes.  For many industries, the important component
of waste management may be reducing waste.  For agriculture, it
may be composting its own waste, and also finding ways to use
the composted organic wastes of urban dwellers.  Identifying the
ways each of us can best manage waste may represent the critical
thin line that determines whether or not we're sustainable.-<I>Bill</I>

<H1>New Grants for Biologically Integrated Farming Systems</H1>

<P>
UC SAREP will be implementing a new competitive grants program
to help farmers reduce their use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers
by adopting biologically integrated farming systems.  The new
Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS) program is the
result of legislation unanimously passed by the California Legislature
and signed by Governor <B>Pete Wilson</B> last fall.  Assembly
Bill 3383 (Agricultural Chemical Reduction Pilot Demonstration
projects) enables the University of California to award grants
providing technical and financial incentives to growers.
<P>
In January 1995 the Regents of the University of California approved
the implementation of this legislation.  UC SAREP will be administering
the competitive grants program, which will provide $585,000 in
state and federal funds for pilot demonstration projects in up
to five commodities in up to five counties.  In 1995, $250,000
of this will come from the California Environmental Protection
Agency's Department of Pesticide Regulation and $335,000 from
US-EPA.
<P>
The program is based on the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems
(BIOS) model, pioneered by the Community Alliance with Family
Farmers Foundation in collaboration with the University of California
in the last several years.  The BIOS model involves a team approach
to project management. A management team is assembled of farmer
consultants, UC farm advisors and researchers, independent pest
control advisors and a project coordinator, all with experience
in reducing agrichemical use through whole-systems management.
 The management team helps the farmer and his or her pest control
advisor develop a customized farm and soil plan and guides them
over the course of the season.  The focus of the BIOS model is
on-farm reduction of agrichemicals.  It draws on a whole-systems
approach, i.e., enhancing soil fertility and crop protection through
the use of cultural practices and biological pest control, creating
on-farm habitats for beneficial insects, using cover crops to
meet some nitrogen needs, and reducing reliance on agricultural
chemicals.
<P>
Previous BIOS projects have emphasized reliance on UC Division
of Agriculture and Natural Resources research, including studies
funded by UC SAREP and the UC Statewide Integrated Pest Management
Project.
<P>
A BIFS program advisory committee has been assembled to evaluate
a draft Request for Proposals (RFP), and to review proposals that
are submitted.  The RFP will be issued in April, with proposals
due at the end of June or mid-July.  Awards will be announced
and made in August.  For more information, contact <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A></B>,

<H2>Students Experience On-farm Research</H2>

<P>
A pilot program designed to offer high school students firsthand
experience in sustainable agriculture and on-farm research has
been started by Winters walnut grower <B>Craig McNamara</B>. 
The one year program is being coordinated by <B>Sandy Creighton</B>
and <B>Mark Linder</B> of the California Foundation for Agriculture
in the Classroom.  It involves six students from each of four
high schools from Northern California.  Students will be working
on projects with the assistance of four UC Davis mentors: <B>Chuck
Ingels</B> and <B><A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A></B> of SAREP; <B>Mike Singer</B>,
soil scientist in the Land, Air and Water Resources Department;
and <B>Frank Zalom</B>, Director of the Statewide Integrated Pest
Management Project.  Students have been participating in the walnut
harvest, planting cover crops, attaching cardboard bands to trees
for codling moth control, and building and installing barn owl
boxes.  The program is being evaluated by <B>Linda Whent,</B>
UCD agricultural teacher trainer.  For more information, contact
Craig McNamara at (916) 795-3824.
<H2>Study: Sustainable Ag Is Economically Competitive</H2>

<P>
A new Northwest Area Foundation publication highlighting six years
of work on sustainable agriculture in seven states finds that
sustainable agriculture can be economically competitive with conventional
agriculture.  The publication, called <I>A Better Row to Hoe,
</I>summarizes the findings of $4.5 million dollars worth of research
projects funded by the Foundation in Iowa, Minnesota, North and
South Dakota, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.  The report notes
that sustainable agriculture can provide new farming and business
opportunities for people in rural communities, and may be especially
appropriate for beginning farmers because it depends more on skilled
labor and management than on capital resources.  It recommends
a comprehensive rural development strategy based on sustainable
agriculture.  In addition, the report calls for a greater emphasis
on research and education which strengthens the management systems
and technology required of sustainable agriculture.  Free copies
of the report can be obtained by contacting the Northwest Area
Foundation, 332 Minnesota St. #E-1201, St. Paul, MN 55101-1373;
(612) 224-9635.
<H2>Community Food Security Coalition Active</H2>

<P>
A coalition of 20 farm, food, and agricultural policy groups is
proposing that agricultural policy reform be based on the concept
of community food security.  The group defines food security as
&quot;all<B> </B>persons obtaining at all times a culturally acceptable,
nutritionally adequate diet through local non-emergency sources.&quot;
They propose to append a section to the 1995 Farm Bill called
<I>The Community Food Security Empowerment </I>Act.  The Act identifies
four strategies for reform: creating a Community Food Security
Program office within the USDA to integrate the concept as a &quot;central
agency mission&quot;; intensifying USDA direct marketing efforts
which support initiatives that encourage consumers to eat locally
grown food; encouraging farming and gardening in urban areas;
and expanding support for federal food assistance programs, particularly
Food Stamps and the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (see related WIC article, page 13).  The
coalition stresses the need for a &quot;comprehensive food systems
approach&quot; that integrates agricultural, nutritional and environmental
concerns at the local level.  For more information, contact <B>Andy
Fisher</B> at (310) 822-5410.
<H2>FDA Approves Seven Genetically Altered Products</H2>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given its endorsement
to companies seeking to market seven new genetically altered products.
 Among the products are three slow-ripening tomatoes, virus-resistant
squash, beetle-resistant potatoes, and herbicide-tolerant cotton
and soybean plants.  The manufacturers had voluntarily submitted
their products to the FDA, which concluded that these plants appear
to be as safe as their nonaltered counterparts.  In addition to
the FDA acceptance, some of these products must be approved by
the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the
Environmental Protection Agency).  For more information, contact
<B>Brad Stone</B> at FDA, (202) 205-4144
<H2>Sustainable Ag Summer Course</H2>

<P>

<H1>FOUND: Spanish Language Sustainable Ag Publications</H1>

<P>
UC SAREP has released a new publication for farm advisors and
others who work with Spanish speaking farmers and farm workers.
 A guide to Spanish Language Sustainable Agriculture Publications
is a collection of English abstracts of 74 Spanish-language documents
about sustainable farming practices.  The abstracts cover a wide
range of topics, from principles of sustainability to practical
information about soil and water management, agricultural machinery,
field safety and learning English as a second language.
<P>
Each abstract includes the author of the original publication,
a summary, its availability, cost and level of readability.  Most
publications were chosen so that individuals with primary or secondary
education can read them.
<P>
SAREP has established repositories of the original Spanish documents
at five strategic sites in California including the farm advisors'
offices in San Diego and Fresno, at UC Santa Barbara, at the Rural
Development Center in Salinas, and at the Small Farm Center at
UC Davis.  The 90-page publication was compiled by Beatriz Cabezon
and published by SAREP in December 1994.  To order, send a check
or money order for $10 payable to &quot;UC Regents&quot; to UC
SAREP, University of California, Davis, CA 95616.  Please note
on the check the name of the publication.  For information about
other SAREP publications, please see <B>Resources</B>, page 18.

<I>[Editor's Note: This is the second part of a two-part article
on the Oct. 20,1994 conference &quot;Animal Agriculture Impacts
on Water Quality in California, ' which reported the results of
a year-long study of the same name undertaken by the UC Davis
Animal Agriculture Research Center and the UC Agricultural Issues
Center. Proceedings are available from both centers (See Resources,
page 18).  The first part appeared in Sustainable Agriculture,
Winter 1995, Vol.7, No.1]</I>
<P>
The third research team report on management practices, technologies
and regulations and their effectiveness at preventing water pollution
was summarized by <B>Valerie Mellano</B>, environmental issues
advisor in the UC Cooperative Extension office in San Diego County.
 She reviewed pertinent regulations including the 1969 Porter-Cologne
Act, which is California's lead water legislation, and the Coastal
Zone Management Act.  Her team's report includes descriptions
of existing practices for confined animal operations in the state,
and comparisons of four major California regions.  She said monitoring
of individual operations can vary from inexpensive manure application
records or photographs to record the status of water bodies and
vegetation, to more technical methods like laboratory analysis
of water quality.  She also itemized the areas where research
is needed to provide new practices and technologies.
<P>
&quot;Management options that are appropriate for one producer
may not be appropriate for another, so regulations and technologies
need to be flexible,&quot; she said.  &quot;You can't write a
regulation or provide a technology that fits everything and expect
it to working all situations-it simply won't.  Therefore, the
input of producers is absolutely necessary.  I realize there's
a need for regulations, but instead of the government specifying
how it has to be done, it would have greater success if it stated
the goal and let the producers come up with a way of meeting that
goal.&quot;
<P>
Yolo County hydrologist <B>Steve Deverel </B>reiterated that a
systems approach is necessary to truly understand the processes
involved in water pollution.  He said in addition to monitoring,
an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to defining and responding
to water pollution problems is required.
<H3>Self-Regulation</H3>

<P>
<B>Paul Feder, </B>an agricultural policy specialist in the US-EPA's
San Francisco water management division, also urged an approach
to water issues that is not &quot;too attached to technologies,
but rather is holistic.&quot; He pointed out that air pollution,
as well as water pollution, is a by-product of animal agriculture.
 He suggested a possible tax on nitrogen fertilizer, which he
called &quot;the most unregulated chemical out there.&quot; He
noted that &quot;it is not whether, but how we regulate&quot;
that is important.  He wondered if the &quot;top-down' approach
is useful, or whether it might be better for the industry to look
at self-regulation.
<P>
&quot;The conservation ethic exists in the field,&quot; he said,
&quot;and finger-pointing hurts the small producers and taxpayers.&quot;
He noted that the Sonoma Marin Dairy Waste Task Force is an outstanding
example of self-regulation and success.  &quot;Strong leadership
is needed,&quot; he said,<B> </B>&quot;and producers have to demand
accountability.&quot;
<P>
Feder said agricultural leadership also needs to put pressure
on the EPA and other regulatory agencies to support more systems
approaches to problem solving.  He urged producers to &quot;move
beyond fear and reactivity, and base solutions on a conservation
ethic.  Who better to do it than the people on the land?&quot;
<P>
<B>Ernie Gemperle, </B>a poultry producer with 1.5 million chickens,
talked about the successful conservation efforts used in his chicken
houses.  He has one acre of lagoon for every 10,000 chickens,
which dilutes the salt content of the waste.  Automatic systems
clean out the chicken houses twice daily, waste goes to holding
tanks, and the chicken manure is used on Gemperle's and neighboring
farms.
<P>
&quot;We have never had a problem getting rid of 200 tons per
day of (wet) manure,' he said.  His new chicken house are designed
so that &quot;bone-dry manure&quot; is under the pens.  Dry manure
only has to be removed and spread every one or two <B>years, </B>compared
to the daily or three times a week spreading that is required
for wet manure.  Gemperle said that as his facilities are modernized
or replaced, there will be no manure on the ground in the rainy
season.
<H3>Hog Lagoons</H3>

<P>
Pork producer <B>Roy Sharp </B>talked about his 17,000 hog operation
in Tulare and the triple lagoon system he has used for 18 years
to handle three tons per day of manure dry matter.
<P>
&quot;With the amount of waste that we produce, we have to do
something with it,&quot; Sharp said.  &quot;With this triple lagoon
system, we digest the waste materials, clean up the water, use
the methane gas byproduct we produce for electricity, and we recycle
the water both through a flushing system as well as through irrigation
and fertilization of crop land.&quot;
<P>
The manure dry matter is flushed daily into the covered primary
lagoon.  The lagoon acts as an anaerobic digester on the waste
materials.  Sharp adds a bacterial enzyme to the primary lagoon
as an enhancement for this process.  The digestion byproduct is
methane gas.  Water used in the system is further cleaned in the
other two lagoons.
<P>
The gas has been producing energy for the Sharp operation for
12 years.  The system includes a 75 kw engine generator, which
uses a 1/2 hp blower pump.  The lagoon produces 70 to 80 percent
methane, in comparison to most bio-gas systems which only produce
50 to 60 percent methane, according to Sharp.  He said he built
his system in 1982 with a $90,000 loan, which he has since paid
off.  In 1985, the operation added a 100 kw generator to make
use of the additional volume of methane from the lagoon.  &quot;The
system is cost-effective and doing a sustainable job for the environment,
&quot; Sharp said.  &quot;It has been so successful that we now
have four cogeneration systems in operation on different sites,
and are completing a fifth system.  It has been a significant
savings in overhead costs.&quot;
<H3>Watershed Perspective</H3>

<P>
The fourth team report on strategies and options for sustaining
animal agriculture from a watershed perspective was presented
by <B>Wesley Wallender, </B>professor of hydrologic science at
UC Davis.  He noted the complexity of California's watersheds,
and stressed that it is necessary to identify the impact of animal
agriculture on each one in order to protect the long-term viability
of the watersheds and the animal systems themselves.
<P>
&quot;Without this information, the door is open for favoring
short-term economic gains over long-term environmental quality,
or vice versa,&quot; he said.  He noted that better measurements
and observations are making it easier &quot;to estimate the flow
of pollutants across boundaries and to appreciate the cumulative
impacts over multiple interconnected land uses.&quot;
<P>
Wallender said &quot;liability and regulation&quot; are the two
categories of tools which guide the management of animal agriculture
systems toward both economic and environmental viability.  His
team's report analyzed them using a systems analysis approach.
 &quot;With liability, there are penalties for polluting, and
with regulation you try to prevent pollution,&quot; he said. 
Tools include cost internalization (producers absorbing all costs),
regulation (regulators setting standards of pollution), and voluntary
compliance, which combines pro-active self-regulation with other
issues.
<P>
&quot;Right now we're at regulation, and we're moving toward voluntary
compliance, but the final stage should be cost internalization,&quot;
Wallender said.  &quot;However, with cost internalization, the
cost of the products must go up to cover production costs.&quot;
<H3>Beef Ranchers </H3>

<P>
Cattle rancher <B>Jack Hanson, Jr. </B>noted that half of California's
39 million acres of range land, which includes approximately 80
percent of the critical, water-filled riparian habitat, is in
private hands.  &quot;A lot of us within our industry believe
we borrow this land from our children,&quot; he said.
<P>
Hanson said that beef ranchers &quot;are essentially 'price-takers,'
and if there are additional costs added to production, we can't
just pass this on to consumers.&quot; He said in California, ranchers
are &quot;ahead of the game,&quot; but fear being too far ahead.
<P>
&quot;A California steer is the same as a Wyoming steer, &quot;
he said, &quot;If we have regulatory costs that they don't have,
it puts us at a competitive disadvantage.&quot;
<P>
<B>Gordon Rausser, </B>dean of the College of Natural Resources
at UC Berkeley, said that regulatory agencies will encourage self-regulation
in manure management by &quot;defining the default options.&quot;
He said this will create incentives for farmers and ranchers to
&quot;come together to collectively set their own regulations,
which in turn, will lead to standards that will hopefully be accepted
by the regulatory agencies.  That's what's beginning to happen
in other areas, and I expect that to happen here, too.&quot;
<P>
<B>George Wingate, </B>a US Bureau of Land Management watershed
specialist noted that &quot;a watershed is a system contained
by a boundary, and includes lots of resources, uses, and values.&quot;
He said pollutants flow through watersheds in the waterways. 
He said the information presented at the conference must be disseminated
throughout the state.
<H3>Systems Approach</H3>

<P>
<B>Terry Young, </B>a senior consulting scientist with the Environmental
Defense Fund, agreed that a systems approach is necessary to solve
water problems.  She said the function of a systems approach is
to analyze the problem (i.e., animal systems and waste management)
and to determine the technical options for solving the problem.
 The next step is the solution, &quot;figuring out what regulatory
or voluntary system will be optimal for where you want to use
it.&quot;
<P>
She said the producers must be made accountable for the pollution
they generate, and environmental objectives must be achieved.
 Ideally, however, a regulatory system can also &quot;acknowledge
that the person on the farm knows better how to solve the problem
than bureaucrats.&quot; The ideal programs are therefore those
that are decentralized and flexible, as well as equitable, fair
and easily administered.  One option for designing such a system
is to use a range of financial incentives that &quot;ease the
pain of regulation.&quot; Incentives are especially attractive
if the proceeds from any taxes are kept within the community and
used to fund operations that the producers would have to finance
anyway.
<P>
Trying to figure out if solutions should be voluntary or mandatory
is asking the wrong question, Young said.  &quot;Instead, the
regulatory agencies should set the goal, then let folks in a watershed
consortium decide how to accomplish the goal, but hold the producers
responsible for results.&quot;
<H3>Research Summary</H3>

<P>
<B>     Kenneth R. Farrell</B>, UC Vice President for the Division
of Agriculture and Natural Resources summarized the conference's
research results at the program's conclusion.  He noted that many
of the California agriculture animal systems use non-edible forage
to make food.  In addition to their own value as food producers,
their byproducts include manure, which can be both a fertilizer
and a pollutant.  The conference identified several approaches
to the use and disposal of that manure.  Site specificity is very
important to the manure's use and disposal, as no two areas are
alike.  Technologies are available to turn manure's potential
detriments into benefits.  Priority problem areas include nitrate
and salt contamination of water, runoff into surface water, and
sedimentation.  Regulatory alternatives include voluntary solutions,
voluntary with economic incentives, and farmers and ranchers internalizing
the cost.
<P>
     He noted that exporting manure from some areas of the state
is necessary, and determining how to make that economically feasible
with transportation is a challenge.  Farrell reiterated that technologies
from other states are not readily or obviously adaptable to California,
thus there is a need here for research and information dissemination.
 Research areas include the characteristics of wastes after treatment;
manures as fertilizers; information on combinations of manure
and chemical fertilizers; economic feasibility of bio-gas production;
and dietary means of altering animal efficiency.
<P>
He urged researchers to integrate their information well, because
&quot;holistic and systems approach solutions based on particular
ecosystems will have the best chance of succeeding.&quot;
<P>
<I>[Correction: In the first part of this series, incorrect figures
were given for the amount of manure produced daily by the 300
million agricultural animals in California.  The correct figure
is approximately 250 million pounds of manure/day.]</I>

<H1>Cover Cropping in Vineyards: Grower Profiles</H1>

<P>
<I>by Chuck Ingels, SAREP</I>
<P>
<I>[Editor's Note: The Grower Profile series is from a chapter
in a forthcoming SAREP publication on cover cropping in vineyards.
 The publication includes contributions by numerous UC and Natural
Resource Conservation Service researchers.  It is edited by Chuck
Ingels and <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> of SAREP,- Glenn McGourty, director, Mendocino
Viticulture Specialist at the UC Kearney Agricultural County;
and Peter Christensen, Cooperative Extension Center in Parlier.]</I>
<P>
   <B>Zach Berkowitz</B> is no stranger to vineyard cover cropping.
 The vice president of vineyard operations at 
<P>
Domaine Chandon, Berkowitz has worked at the vineyard since 1974
and has tested a wide range of cover crop species and management
practices.  He oversees 1,300 acres of vineyards (mostly Pinot
Noir and Chardonnay) in Sonoma, Napa, and Mendocino counties.
 The vineyards have a diverse array of conditions: Terrain ranges
from flat to rolling hills to very steep hillsides; soils range
from clayey to sandy, and from very deep to only one to two feet
deep; rainfall varies from 20 to 45 inches; and both drip and
sprinkler irrigation are used.
<P>
     Domaine Chandon managers started using cover crops in vineyards
prone to erosion, testing different quick-growing species.  One
mix that proved successful in a trial with the Napa County Resource
Conservation District involved the perennial grasses meadow barley,
Covar sheep fescue, and the annual forb crimson clover, which
reseeds well.  Now, however, the most commonly used no-till cover
crop for hillside vineyards at Chandon is a mix of Blando brome
and annual clovers (rose, crimson, and subterranean).
<H3>Green Manure</H3>

<P>
     On less fertile sites, or where erosion control is needed
in new vineyards, a green manure (plow-down) blend of common,
purple, and Lana woollypod vetches, Austrian winter pea, bell
bean, and either oat or barley is used.  This mix is also used
to build the soil in fallow areas before planting vines.  On very
high-vigor sites, Chandon managers have tried annual ryegrass
and other aggressive grass mixes in various layouts to control
excessive vine growth.  The strategy that best reduced vine growth
involved alternate row planting of these grasses.  Berkowitz notes
that grasses alone may take up large quantities of nitrogen from
the soil.  In most of Chandon's vineyards, he has observed that
including a legume in cover crop mixes reduces competition and
often results in improved wine quality.  Chandon's vineyard managers
are now testing California native perennial grasses and insectary
blends.
<P>
     Managing the cover crop has proven as challenging as selecting
the right species.  Like many growers, Berkowitz has found that
the earlier in the fall the cover crop is planted (at least by
mid-October), the better the cover crop seems to grow.  But harvest
is still taking place, and the only grain drill available is in
high demand during this period.  To avoid this conflict, cover
crop seeding is started in mid-September in vineyards harvested
early.  After sowing, fall rains germinate the cover crop; no
irrigation is applied to the cover crops in the fall or spring.
 The cover is mowed high (six to eight inches) once in the winter
and again in the spring before vine flowering.
<P>
Berkowitz and the vineyard managers weighed the benefits of disking
vs. nontillage for vetch mix described.  Ultimately, they would
like to avoid disking altogether.  They like the biomass which
vetch contributes, but the vetch  frequently grows up onto trellises;
also vetch dries the soil rapidly.  To balance these issues, they
cultivate every other row in early April and mow the alternating
rows.  The mowed rows are disked in May, giving more time for
the cover crop to attract beneficial insects, spiders, and mites.
 This strategy has proved successful since it reduces the competition
with the vines for water and nutrients in late spring.  For the
same reason, every row is disked in April during exceptionally
dry springs.  According to Berkowitz, this alternate row strategy
has improved wine quality by reducing the green characters (lowering
the malic acid level) of their sparkling wines.              
     
<P>
  
<H3>Timing</H3>

<P>
As with most growers, not all Domaine Chandon's experiments with
cover cropping have been successful.  Berkowitz says Zorro fescue
was planted in one vineyard in the fall between rows where vines
were to be planted the following spring; the vineyard was to be
managed without tillage.  During the first year, the vines grew
poorly and many of their leaves had fallen by late summer.  The
vines were again stressed in the second spring.  Then the vineyard
manger decided to disk part of the vineyard  in early June, after
which the vines appeared to recover rapidly.  Berkowitz cautions
that, if possible growers should hold off on cover cropping until
about the second fall after planting the vines in order to avoid
stressing them.  If cover crops are used from the start, he notes,
growers should consider disking alternate rows early in the spring,
adding extra nitrogen and potassium, increasing the proportion
of legumes in the mix, or planting the cover crop in a narrow
band between vine rows.
<P>
     The potential effects of Phylloxera on vines are also considered
when choosing and managing cover crops.  Berkowitz notes that
there are two viewpoints on soil management practices in susceptible
vineyards:  1) cover cropping without tillage, to avoid spreading
the insects via soil cultivation tools, and 2) cover cropping
with tillage to reduce competition of the cover crop with the
already compromised vine root systems.  As a result, tillage is
used with cover crops in Domaine Chandon vineyards planted on
AXR 1 rootstock.  Green manure cover crops are often used to improve
the root environment of susceptible blocks.

<H3>SAREP/BIFS Grants</H3>

<P>
UC SAREP is implementing a new competitive grants program, the
Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS), to help farmers
reduce their use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.  BIFS
is the result of AB 3383, legislation that authorizes agricultural
chemical reduction pilot demonstration projects throughout the
state.  SAREP will administer the grants program, which will provide
$585,000 in state and federal funds for projects in up to five
commodities in up to five counties.  Please see &quot;New Grants
for Biologically Integrated Farming Systems,&quot; page 2. To
receive the Request for Proposals, contact <A HREF="/sarep/staff/staff4.html">Robert Bugg</A> at SAREP,
(916) 754-8549, or 752-7556.
<H3>USDA SARE Grants</H3>

<P>
Producers and producer groups residing in the Western U.S. are
now eligible to compete for USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education (SARE) program grants of up to $5,000 each to identify,
evaluate and test sustainable agriculture practices.  Western
SARE has issued a call for farmer/rancher research grant proposals
from agricultural producers in its 13-state region (Alaska, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and the Island Protectorates).
 Proposals should define local sustainable agriculture problems
and propose innovative solutions.  On-farm tests of suggested
technologies and approaches are strongly encouraged.  Research
proposals must be led by one or more producers, include a professional
agricultural technical advisor and provide a plan for sharing
information with others in the community.  A majority of the review
committee are producers familiar with sustainable agriculture.
 All funding will be awarded competitively.  For information or
to request application materials, write grants program manager
Rhonda Miller, Western Region SARE, ASTE Building, Utah State
University, Logan, UT, 84322-2300 or call (801) 797-0351.  Proposals
are due at the program's host institution at Utah State University
by 5 p.m., May 2, 1995 (or postmarked by April 28, 1995).  No
faxed applications will be accepted.
<H3>Lindbergh Grants</H3>

<P>

<H1>Soil and water quality: An agenda for agriculture.</H1>

<I>National Academy Press, Washington, DC. 1993</I>

<P>
In 1989, the same year the National Research Council published
its landmark book <I>Alternative Agriculture, </I>the Council's
Board on Agriculture convened a committee to address the critical
issues of soil and water quality in the U.S. Their purpose was
to identify what agriculture could do to protect and improve the
quality of these natural resources.  The result of the committee's
work is <I>Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for Agriculture.
 </I>The book contains 12 chapters.  The main part of the committee's
analysis and recommendations are included in the first four chapters,
in which they define the problems and issues.  The remaining eight
chapters provide the technical information that form the basis
of their recommendations.
<H3>What is the Agenda?</H3>

<P>
According to the book's Executive Summary, &quot;the committee's
deliberations were based on three basic concepts of soil and water
resource management: 1) the fundamental importance of the soil
and of the links between soil quality and water pollution, 2)
the importance of preventing rather than mitigating water pollution,
and 3) the need to sustain profitable and productive farming systems
to provide the food and fiber society demands.&quot; From this
foundation, the report outlines four areas which hold the greatest
opportunities for maintaining or improving soil and water quality.
 These four areas comprise the &quot;agenda for agriculture&quot;
referred to in the title of the book.
<P>
<B>Enhancing soil quality.  </B>The report suggests that soil
quality has been defined too narrowly by erosion potential and
soil
<P>
nutrient status.  In fact, soil quality encompasses much more
than these two areas: salinization, compaction, acidification,
and loss of biological activity are also concerns.  The importance
of maintaining and improving soil quality is not just a productivity
or yield issue.  The quality of our air and water resources are
also at stake since they are so closely linked to soil quality.
<P>
<B>Improving efficiency in the use of inputs.  </B>Protecting
soil quality alone will not prevent water pollution unless farm
inputs are also used efficiently.  Many technologies and management
practices are available to farmers and ranchers to improve efficiency.
 In some cases efficiency may mean improving yield with the same
level of inputs; in other cases it involves maintaining yield
and quality while reducing inputs.  The most important factor
determining the success of new technologies and practices is whether
or not the farmer or rancher has an economic incentive for adopting
the new methods.  In the absence of economic incentives, regulations
will play a key role.
<P>
<B>Preventing erosion and runoff.  </B>Much progress has been
made in developing conservation tillage and residue management
systems over the last decade.  These have been adopted to varying
degrees, but where they have been implemented they result in dramatic
decreases in erosion and runoff from farms and watersheds.  To
improve on these conservation practices, the report says, we need
also to design farming systems that account for the infrequent
and unpredictable storm events that can do so much damage.  These
design changes could include on-farm flood control, the use of
vegetative cover, or the planting of hedgerows and windbreaks.
<P>
<B>Use of field and landscape buffer zones.  </B>A farm-by-farm
approach to conserving soil and water quality will not be adequate
to protect regions where overland and subsurface movements of
nutrients, pesticides, salts, and sediment occur &quot;Buffer
zones,&quot; according to the report, &quot;to intercept or immobilize
pollutants and reduce the amount and energy of runoff need to
be created.&quot;  Buffer zones can include riparian corridors,
grass strips, wetlands, and shelterbelts.
<P>
<B>     </B>
<H3>Implementing the Agenda</H3>

<P>
To implement this agenda, according to the committee, we must
first make better use of available technologies and
<P>
information.  Many of these are alluded to in the four points
of the agenda and include the use of cover crops and green manures,
improved management and use of livestock wastes, conservation
tillage, irrigation management technologies, drip irrigation,
environmental monitoring on farms and ranches, improved fertilizer
and pesticide application techniques, crop rotation, biological
control, and hedgerows and other plantings for habitat and erosion
control.  These and other practices are helping us achieve some
soil and water quality goals, but to make real progress will require
a greater emphasis on and awareness of the interrelationships
and links that exist within farming systems and watersheds.  The
committee recognizes this need and devotes one chapter to the
subject.
<P>
<B>     </B>
<H3>A Systems Approach to Soil and Water Quality Management</H3>

<P>
The farming system includes the crops grown, and/or the livestock
managed; the ecosystem and landscape in which the farm or ranch
exists; the environmental and human resources involved in production;
inputs and management
<P>
skills; and the policies and programs affecting the farm or ranch.
 The challenge for farmers and ranchers in imple- menting a soil
and water quality agenda is to balance the multiple and linked
objectives involved in the production system.  A change in one
management practice affects other components of the farm or ranch,
therefore an integrated approach to the four points of the agenda
is essential to meet soil and water quality goals and ensure that
farms and ranches remain economically viable.
<P>
This systems-level perspective is also important for policy makers
and regulators.  A broad range of local, state, and federal programs
have a significant impact on farmers and ranchers.  Ideally these
programs should complement and reinforce one another.  Without
a systems perspective, however, programs may contradict and counteract
each other, placing an undue burden on the farmer or rancher.
 The report provides an overview of many of the programs currently
in place.
<P>
Use of a farming systems approach rather than emphasizing individual
best management practices pays off in five ways, according to
the book.  A farming systems approach:  1) accounts for resource
and enterprise variability, 2) provides a basis for targeting
programs and financial support where improved soil and water quality
is most needed, 3) encourages better coordination of local, state,
and federal programs, 4) increase the likelihood of finding practices
and programs that simultaneously improve financial and environmental
performance; and 5) allows for greater flexibility to adapt programs,
policies and practices to changing resource or market conditions.
<P>
In closing this discussion, the report builds a strong case for
the current USDA emphasis on developing integrated farming system
plans.  This process is currently underway throughout the country,
coordinated mainly through the Natural Resources Conservation
Service.  The success of this planning effort will be measured
by farmers' and ranchers' ability to meet their own goals as well
as the objectives or standards set by state and federal policies.

In 1989, Connecticut was one of ten states that received USDA
funding to provide some of its WIC (Women, Infant and Children
nutrition program) participants with special coupons to purchase
fresh produce at farmers' markets.  Matching funds came from the
Connecticut Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health
Services.  A total of 3 7,71 1 WIC participants received an additional
$10 in coupons for fresh fruit and vegetables, redeemable only
at farmers' markets.  Overall goals of the Farmers' Market Coupon
Program are to expand marketing opportunities for local farmers,
while at the same time improve access to fresh, local foods for
low-income residents.
<P>
This study evaluated the success of Connecticut's program in meeting
these goals.  The hypotheses tested were: 1) the distribution
of farmers' market coupons would lead to increased utilization
of farmers' markets by WIC participants, and 2) program participants
would show significant increases in their frequency of consumption
of fresh fruits and vegetables.
<H3>Methods</H3>

<P>
Nine WIC programs participated in the study; six distributing
farmers' market coupons (treatment group) and three that did not
(control group).  Four of the six treatment programs had distributed
the coupons in previous years.  These programs were specifically
selected to determine if the previous coupon distribution would
influence later use.  A total of 489 participants were interviewed
in July and August for a pre-assessment (411 in the treatment
group and 78 in the control group).  The treatment group was deliberately
oversampled in order to compare subjects who received and <I>used
</I>coupons with those who received and <I>did not </I>use coupons.
<P>
The initial interviews included questions about participants'
use of farmers' markets and consumption of fruits, vegetables
and juices.  About two to four months later (November/December),
the same subjects were contacted by phone for a post-assessment.
 Questions included the participants' use of farmers' markets
during the test period, their use of the farmers' market coupons
(if received), factors associated with their use and a re-evaluation
of fruit, vegetable and juice consumption.
<H3>Results</H3>

<P>
Post-assessments were completed with 216 of the original 489 subjects:
172 treatment subjects and 44 control subjects.  This return rate
(44%) is characteristic of low-income, mobile populations.  Those
who responded were not representative of the group that was initially
interviewed.  They were more likely to be white, more educated,
have cars and come from larger households, but they were less
likely to be heads of households.
<P>
<B>Coupon use and use of other resources.  </B>In the treatment
group, 79.1 percent said they used some of their coupons and 57
percent said they used all of their coupons.  Factors that were
significantly associated with coupon use included: having shopped
at a farmers' market before, having received farmers' market coupons
previously, having a shorter distance to travel to get to a farmers'
market, and ethnicity (Black and Hispanic subjects were more likely
to use their coupons).  Thirty-six percent of participants said
they also spent either some of their own money (33.8%) or Food
Stamps (2.2%) or both (9.6%) at farmers' markets in addition to
the coupons.
<P>
<B>Repeated use of farmers' markets.  </B>Almost one-third of
coupon users went back to farmers' markets after using the farmers'
market coupons.  Those factors associated with returning to farmers'
markets included: mode of transportation (subjects who walked,
drove or rode with a friend were twice as likely to return as
those who depended on buses or other ways of getting to markets),
and a positive perception of produce quality at the markets. 
Lack of information about the market was mentioned as a reason
by more than half of the control group that did not go to the
farmers' market in the summer.  This suggests that the Farmers'
Market Coupon Program can help promote the use of farmers' markets
by making participants more aware of them.
<P>
<B>Food purchasing patterns.  </B>Specific foods purchased at
farmers' markets by more than one quarter of participants included
corn (38.2%), tomatoes (31.3%) and apples (28.5%). Foods chosen
by ten to 15 percent of study participants included peaches, peppers,
cucumbers, squash and pears.  Over 60 percent said that the quality
of the produce was better at farmers' markets than where they
usually shopped and that prices were lower.  Almost one quarter
of participants said they tried a new food they had never bought
before.  Nearly half (44.2%) of coupon users said the Farmers'
Market Coupon Program caused them to make changes in their diets,
particularly in eating more fresh foods and more fruits and vegetables.
<P>
Although participants praised food quality, they also had suggestions
for improving the Farmers' Market Coupon Program, including: changing
the hours of operation, improving the location of the farmers'
market (62.5% of subjects who received but did not use any of
their coupons identified the location as a barrier), making transportation
available, making childcare available and offering more information.
<P>
<B>Frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption.  </B>Interview
questions in this area referred to overall consumption of fruits
and vegetables, not just that from farmers' markets.  Changes
in the overall frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption between
pre- and post-assessments did not differ significantly between
control and treatment groups or
<P>
between coupon users and non-users.  This result is not surprising,
since the average addition of $6 worth of produce per year cannot
be expected to produce major dietary changes.  However, coupon
users who also used their own resources at farmers' markets did
show significant increases in their overall consumption of certain
fresh vegetables (i.e., dark orange vegetables, peppers, tomatoes)
over those who did not use additional resources.  In addition,
subjects who returned to the farmers' market after using up their
coupons showed significantly greater consumption of fresh dark
green vegetables, cauliflower, cabbage and other canned or frozen
vegetables in their diets.
<P>
The authors conclude that the Connecticut Farmers'  Market Coupon
Program was generally successful in meeting its goals-three-quarters
of the program recipients used their coupons at farmers' markets
to purchase fresh, local produce; some groups also benefited by
significantly increasing their overall produce consumption; and
local farmers simultaneously expanded their markets.
<H3>Reviewer's Comments</H3>

<P>
California has conducted a very successful Farmers' Market Coupon
Program since 1990 (federal funds were received for the first
time in 1994).  Since the state was not able to provide funding
for the program, monies were raised from farmers' markets associations
in order to get federal matching funds.  In 1994, $32,000 was
raised from farmers' market &quot;sponsors&quot; and the federal
government provided another $52,000 for a total of $84,000.  These
monies provided for the administration of the program as well
as $20 coupon booklets for 4,368 WIC participants.  Almost 85
percent of these coupons were redeemed at 34 participating farmers'
markets, providing fresh, local produce to thousands of pregnant
and nursing women and their children.  Moreover, California farmers
more than doubled their initial investment from $32,000 to more
than $64,000 (including in-kind contributions).  Every market
that participated realized at least a 50 percent gain.  The Farmers'
Market Nutrition Program (as it is now called) is an opportunity
to benefit both California farmers and low-income consumers. 
Increased funding for this program would leverage additional resources
and simultaneously improve the nutritional status of California's
WIC participants and the economic viability of its family farmers.

1995
<P>
Farmers and ranchers are looking closely at the benefits barn
owls offer as an alternative method of controlling vertebrate
pests (see <I>Sustainable Agriculture Vol. 5. No. 1</I>).  The
diet of the barn owl <I>(Tyto alba) </I>is<B> </B>relatively easy
to ascertain, and several dozen studies have been conducted throughout
the U.S. to determine the prey species consumed (Clark and Bunck,
1991).  Barn owls swallow their prey whole and later regurgitate
one to two inch pellets containing undigested bones, teeth, and
fur.  The owls usually produce one to two pellets per day, often
dropping one at their nesting site and one at a distant roosting
site (Evans and Emlen, 1947).  Skulls found in these pellets can
be keyed out to determine the identity of the prey species.
<P>
Over 95 percent of the diet usually consists of small mammals
(mostly rodents), however in some studies substantial bird remains
have been found.  According to Colvin (1986), each adult barn
owl may consume about one or two rodents per night; a nesting
pair and their young can eat over 1,000 rodents per year.  Dietary
studies from California and other states show that a barn owl
consumes an average 50 to 60 grams of prey per day (0.11-0.13
pounds per day, 40-48 pounds per year).  The actual species consumed
depends on the species abundance and availability in the area.
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
Table 1 shows the results of several barn owl prey studies conducted
in California.  In many studies, meadow voles and/or pocket gophers
were consumed most often, while pocket, white-footed, and house
mice were also important.  One notable species missing in nearly
all these studies is the California ground squirrel <I>(Spermophilus
beecheyi).  </I>This species ventures above ground only during
the day, while the barn owl hunts almost strictly at night.
<H3>Study Findings</H3>

<P>
<B>Berkeley 1926-27.  </B>Because each of these studies took place
in Berkeley and because the results of each were very similar,
the percentages of each species were averaged and combined into
one column.  In one study (Foster, 1926), pellets were collected
on one sampling date from under a nest in Wildcat Canyon, just
northeast of Berkeley.  In another study (Foster, 1927), pellets
were collected over a period of one and a half years from a nest
located in a cave in Wildcat Canyon.  Prey counts were separated
by the dry season vs. the wet season.  More shrews, Jerusalem
crickets, and white-footed and pocket mice were taken during the
dry season than the wet season, while the opposite was true for
pocket gophers.  In a third study (Hall, 1927), accumulated pellets
were collected on one sampling date from a location in Berkeley.

<B>San Francisco Bay region </B>(Smith and Hopkins, 1937).  In
this study, 12 boxes were installed in trees and barns in these
counties: Marin (4), Contra Costa (2), Alameda (3), and San Mateo
(3).  A total of 141 pellets were collected over three years.
 California meadow voles were found most frequently except in
Marin County, where pocket gophers predominated.
<P>
<B>Central California </B>(Hawbecker, 1945).  Pellets were collected
over a wide area during the nesting seasons of several years.
 Three types of habitat were included in this study, ranging from
a well-forested, humid region to one that is treeless and shrubless.
 The specific regions and important prey findings are as follows:
<P>
1. Santa Cruz and western Monterey counties (coastal Transition
Zone): pocket gophers-33%, meadow voles-17%, and birds-16%.
<P>
2. Eastern Monterey and western San Benito counties (Upper Sonoran
zone): pocket gophers-52%, pocket mice-17%.
<P>
3. Western Merced and Fresno counties (Lower Sonoran Zone): pocket
mice-66%.
<P>
Based on rodent trapping in several of the study areas, the barn
owl was found to serve as a good sampler of the small mammals
of a given area.  However, the author noted that the selection
of species appeared to be based partially upon numbers and ease
of capture.
<P>
<B>Davis </B>(Evans and Emlen, 1947).  An average of one pellet
per day was found beneath a palm tree over a one year period.
 The palm tree served as a daytime roost to one barn owl.  Based
on nighttime observations, the owl was determined to have a hunting
range of about 165 acres.  About 140 acres were in open fields
planted largely to grain and alfalfa and 25 were in wooded areas
along Putah Creek.  Animals typically associated with wooded or
brushy cover, including house mice, deer mice <I>(Peromyscus),
</I>harvest mice, and roof rats, comprised 57 percent of the total
food items.  Open field habitats, more than six times as extensive
on the owl's range, contributed the remaining 43 percent of the
items, which included pocket gophers and meadow voles.  During
the fall, the numbers of house and deer mice taken declined, while
pocket gopher numbers steadily increased from winter through fall.
<P>
<B>Madera County foothills </B>(Fitch, 1947).  This study was
conducted in the blue oak-Digger pine belt of the Upper Sonoran
Zone of Madera County.  The region is comprised of rolling foothills
broken by numerous ravines, and includes substantial grassland.
 Barn owl pellets were collected over four years at four sites.
 Computed on a prey weight basis, the pocket gopher accounted
for 71 percent of the diet of the barn owls.  Pellets were also
collected from day roosts of great horned owls, which were far
more numerous than barn owls in this area.  The diet of the great
horned owls consisted largely of Jerusalem crickets, woodrats,
cottontails, kangaroo rats, and pocket gophers.  On a weight basis,
56 percent of the diet was cottontails.  For comparison, the diet
of red-tailed hawks was also presented from a related study. 
On a weight basis, 50 percent of the diet of the hawks consisted
of ground squirrels.
<P>
<B>Coastal Los Angeles County </B>(Cunningham, 1960).  Pellets
were collected once from the base of a date palm tree.  Because
of the abundance of wood rats and the low percentage of pocket
gophers and meadow mice, the author concluded that the barn owls
foraged largely in the chaparral-covered Santa Monica Mountains
about two miles north of the collection site.  Two samples of
great homed owl pellets were also taken; their diet consisted
mostly of pocket gophers, house mice, meadow mice, and wood rats.
<P>
<B>Placer County</B> (Clark and Wise, 1974).  Pellets were collected
at eight sites along the eastern edge of the Sacramento Valley,
mostly from barns just northwest of Lincoln.  On a weight basis,
over half of the diet of the barn owl consisted of pocket gophers,
while white-footed mice accounted for only about seven percent.
<P>
<B>Siskiyou County</B> (Rudolph, 1978).  This study examined the
coexistence and diets of barn owls and great horned owls at Tule
Lake National Wildlife Refuge.  The owls roosted on rock cliffs
with a hunting range that included natural vegetation and agricultural
fields.  Pellets were collected at weekly intervals from the roosting
sites.  The diet of the great horned owls was very similar to
that of the barn owls.  Barn owls were found to hunt primarily
on the wing, while great horned owls hunted primarily from telephone
poles.

<P>
USDA SARE/ACE Western Region Annual Report, p. 13. 1994
<P>
<I>Editor's Note: In the fall 1994 issue of <B>Sustainable Agriculture</B>
(<B>Vol.6, No.4),</B> we included a technical review that addressed
the importance of soil microfauna (mainly nematodes and protozoa)
in plant disease suppression.  Although these soil animals represent
a significant biological control potential, it is not clear whether
or not that potential can be exploited in the field.  The article
reviewed here provides an example of how soil-dwelling organisms
might be manipulated in cropping systems.  The pest in this case
is a weed; the biocontrol agents are soil bacteria.</I>
<P>
Jointed goatgrass <I>(Aegilops cylindrica) </I>is fast becoming
a major threat to fall-sown small grains.  It now infests an estimated
five million acres nationally and is reducing growers' income
by $145 million annually.  Herbicides for controlling this weed
are not available.  The objective of this research was to develop
a biological weed control method that would provide an economic
benefit to grain growers affected by jointed goatgrass.  The approach
taken was to isolate soil bacteria that could inhibit growth of
the weed.
<P>
In initial greenhouse studies, four isolated bacteria reduced
jointed goatgrass growth 30 to 70 percent.  These isolates were
used in field tests in 1993.  In the field, two of the four tested
bacteria effectively suppressed growth of the weed.  These two
isolates reduced weed emergence, but by June, visual differences
in aboveground plant growth were not evident.  The effect of the
bacteria was more pronounced in the latter part of the growing
season, because by August aboveground growth had been suppressed
by 20 to 30 percent.  Researchers noted that the bacteria delayed
flowering and increased anthocyanin production by the weed.  Wheat
growth was not affected by the bacteria.  In addition, the bacteria
were found to be more effective when used in combination with
low rates of a synthetic herbicide.
<P>
The ability of the bacteria to survive in different geographical
regions, and from season to season, is critical if this biological
control method is to be successful.  The researchers have been
able to select for isolates that are better able to withstand
desiccation, but further studies under other types of stresses
are needed.

For the past three years he has been a member of the steering committee of the California Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (CASA), a coalition of non-profit groups and university programs funded by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. He considers all this work appropriate penance for having grown up laughing at his quirky gardener Grandmother and her compost pile next to the outhouse. He now has his own compost pile, and a slug-infested garden, but not, alas, an outhouse. When hes not trying to save the world he enjoys writing and reading poetry.<BR>

<p><hr><p><blockquote>
Gail Feenstra is a senior writer and food systems analyst at the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program.  Her interests lie in the area of working with university and community members to develop community food systems in California.  She is on the board of the California Sustainable Agriculture Working Group (SAWG) and also participates as a co-chair of the Community Food Security Committee of the California SAWG.  She has been involved in helping to organize a number of activities and projects that link farmers and consumers in California.  Gail is also a nutritionist with a background in nutrition education.  One of her goals has been to encourage nutritionists, anti-hunger advocates and sustainable agriculture groups in California to become coalition partners in building more sustainable food systems.<P>
</blockquote>
<B>Current/Past Projects:</b><blockquote>Gail has been working for the past several years, with Dave Campbell, SAREP's economic and public policy analyst on a project that links sustainable agriculture and community development.This project arose out of a growing recognition of the opportunities to connect the use of sustainable production practices with the economic and social development of California communities.  Initial funding came from a $2 million grant from the W.K. Kelloggs Integrated Farming Systems Initiative, which funded a three-year project directed by the California Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (CASA), a new coalition of six non-profit groups and three university programs.  The community development work represents an important piece of the CASA project and has influenced a much broader network of researchers and practitioners in the sustainable agriculture movement.<P>
The goal of the project is to identify both general principles and concrete strategies which link sustainable agricultural practices to community development.  The following methods have been used to achieve this goal:<BR>
 a review of existing literature linking sustainable agriculture to community development,<BR>
 a review of new directions in "community-controlled economic development,"<BR>
 a review of existing local food systems across the U.S.,<BR>
 a survey of community food systems collaborations currently underway in California<BR>
 intentional networking with people in community food security, community economic development and sustainable agriculture areas,<BR>
 creation and support of the Sustainable Agriculture Working Group.<P>
Progress to date<BR>
Initial working papers about community economic development strategies and local food systems were drafted and reviewed by individuals within and outside DANR.  These papers were revised and subsequently presented at a conference on "The Politics of Sustainable Agriculture," held in Eugene, Oregon, in October 1995.  Since then, Local Food Systems and Sustainable Communities, by Gail Feenstra has been accepted for publication by the American Journal of Alternative Agriculture.  Community-controlled Economic Development as a Strategic Vision for the Sustainable Agriculture Movement by Dave Campbell is currently under consideration for publication by the AJAA.<P>
A community food systems bibliography with nearly 100 entries has been prepared, along with a two-page pamphlet "Steps for Developing a Sustainable Community Food System."  These materials along with the two papers have been widely distributed among interested parties in the state, including CE personnel, community organizations and university researchers.<P>
Currently, a survey is underway to identify and profile the most prominent community food systems in California.  We define a community food system as a collaborative effort to integrate local agricultural production with food distribution in order to enhance the economic, environmental and social well-being of a particular place (i.e., a neighborhood, city, county or region).  Although there is a growing interest in developing these community food systems nationwide, few have been documented.  Responses from the survey will be used to compile a publication which will document current activities, enable existing organizations to make connections and benefit from each others experiences, and analyze what can be done to encourage new and more effective collaborations.<P>
This October 2-3, SAREP is planning a major community food systems conference called, "Community Food Systems: Sustaining Farms and People in the Emerging Economy" which will bring together interested parties from across the state, showcase innovative work, and promote further reflection on the issues facing communities who wish to revitalize their food and agricultural economies.  The conference is co-sponsored by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, the Community Food Security Coalition, the California Communities Program and SAREP.<P>
SAREP and the California Communities Program are currently in discussion with a nationwide research team to propose a USDA-funded study of "Local Food and Agricultural Systems in a Globalizing Environment." Along with grassroots organizing, more research of this kind is needed to assess the tangible social and economic benefits associated with developing community food systems. <P>
In addition to these projects, Gail is on the advisory board of the California Federation of Farmers' Markets.  She has been involved in discussions with the California Federation of Farmers' Markets and the USDA to develop a statewide consumer education campaign to promote farmers' markets.<P>
She is also on the board of the Agriculture, Food and Human Values Society.  She is participating with other board members in a project to improve communication and research initiatives among people across the country interested in community or local food systems.<P>

<P>
The University of California Sustainable Agriculture Research
and Education Program is soliciting proposals for new and continuing
research and education projects that will enhance the future of
California agriculture and the natural and human resources upon
which it depends. Sustainable agriculture integrates three goals:
environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic
equity. Please consult our publications for specific methods and
examples that address these goals. Free publications include a
five-page paper, What is Sustainable Agriculture, our recent Progress
Report: 1993-1995, and the quarterly newsletter Sustainable Agriculture.
Order them from SAREP, University of California, Davis, CA 95616,
telephone (916) 752-7556.
<P>
SAREP actively seeks proposals from private non-profit groups
as well as UC investigators and researchers from other universities.
Projects that creatively link university faculty, UC Cooperative
Extension, farmers, and non-profit, community-based organizations
are particularly welcome. All investigators must be affiliated
with a California non-profit, tax-exempt organization.
<P>
We encourage proposals that exhibit a blend between a research
component which gathers reliable data, an educational component
which brings practical and timely information to targeted audiences,
and a demonstration or community development component which creates
new relationships, alliances, or institutions. Projects that are
not collaborative in nature or that focus exclusively on only
one of these three components will also be considered, especially
where it can be demonstrated that the results will be useful to
ongoing or future development of sustainable food and agricultural
systems. 
<P>
Projects may address either a single problem or a set of interrelated
problems that are critical to the sustainable functioning of a
particular farming, ranching, or food system. Proposals must clearly
demonstrate how the component in question is critical to the system
being studied, and how the results of the work can be integrated
into the whole agricultural system.<BR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER>CRITERIA </CENTER></H3>

<P>
<B>All proposals will be judged according to the following criteria:</B>
<BR>
<B>Relevance: </B>Help achieve the stated goals and priorities
of SAREP, and be consistent with a holistic approach that simultaneously
weighs concerns for environmental quality, economic viability,
and social responsibility. 
<P>
<B>Team Approach:</B> Include on the project team people affected
by the project (especially farmers or farmworkers) and demonstrate
the ability of the proposal to foster collaboration which educates
and links a variety of players in the food system, including researchers,
farmers and farmworkers, farm advisors, non-profit groups, policymakers,
community organizations, and consumers. 
<P>
<B>Technical Merit:</B> Demonstrate the feasibility of fulfilling
objectives, the effectiveness of the methods proposed, and the
qualifications and relevant experience of the individuals and
organizations submitting the proposal. 
<P>
<B>Impact:</B> Produce new information, or make accessible existing
information, that reaches a significant audience and has a timely
and tangible impact. Tangible products are strongly encouraged.

<P>
<B>Cost-Effectiveness</B>: Provide evidence that the money requested
will be used effectively and is realistic given the objectives
of the project.
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>FUNDING PRIORITIES </CENTER></H3>

<P>
Projects that involve both crop and livestock production issues
as well as community development and public policy issues, and
that integrate the three goals of sustainable agriculture (environmental
health, economic profitability, and social and economic equity)
are particularly welcome. We wish to fund a mix of projects reflecting
the agricultural, geographic and ethnic diversity in the state-projects
useful to both large and small farmers and ranchers, as well as
consumers, farm workers, and other members of the public. The
specific possibilities mentioned in each area below are intended
to give suggestions but not to limit possible proposals. 
<H3>Crop and Livestock Production </H3>

<P>
Proposals are accepted on a variety of topics in production agriculture.
Generally, proposals should be explicitly linked to the principles
of sustainable farming practices that apply to innovations in
&quot;conventional&quot; agriculture as well as low-input and
organic agriculture. These principles include, but are not limited
to: 
<OL>
<LI>reduced reliance on off-farm inputs, especially fertilizers
and pesticides 
<LI>diversification of crops and/or livestock, surrounding habitat,
and other practices to enhance the biological and economic stability
of the farm or ranch
<LI>management of the soil to enhance and protect soil quality
and to prevent the off-site movement of soil nutrients
<LI>use of cultural practices that are least toxic and use the
least amount of nonrenewable energy. 
</OL>

<P>
Within these general principles, the following topics are of particular
interest:
<P>
<I><B>Soil Management</B></I> <BR>
Topics of research or education projects in this area may include,
but are not limited to:
<UL>
<LI>Improvement of soil fertility
<LI>Nutrient recycling
<LI>Improvement of soil structure and water penetration
<LI>Suppression of soil-borne pathogens
<LI>Erosion control 
</UL>

<P>
Suggested approaches include farming practices such as crop rotation,
cover cropping, addition of composts, manures, mulches, or similar
materials, micro and mesofauna enhancement, tillage practices,
and/or irrigation management, and proposals that lead to an increased
understanding of basic soil processes.
<P>
<I><B>Habitat Enhancement for Biological Pest Management</B></I>
<BR>
Projects are encouraged that increase our understanding of the
control of insect, weed, disease, or vertebrate pests through
the manipulation of habitats on or adjacent to cropland. Specific
practices may include:
<UL>
<LI>Crop rotation
<LI>Cover cropping
<LI>Use of insectary plants or hedgerows
<LI>Enhancement of riparian areas
<LI>Application of mulches
<LI>Installation of raptor nest boxes or perches
<LI>Other innovative biocontrol methods 
</UL>

<P>
<I><B>Economic Analysis</B></I> <BR>
Projects in this category include those that assess the costs
and returns to farmers and ranchers of different management practices
and systems. We are particularly interested in projects that compare
practices and systems that are thought to be more environmentally
and/or socially advantageous than those that are currently practiced.
The analysis should assess costs and returns within the current
economic and regulatory context, and also take into account potential
changes in that context over the short and long term.
<P>
<I><B>Concentrated Animal Production<BR>
</B></I>Concentrated livestock and poultry systems are very important
in California. They provide ways to use resources that people
cannot utilize, while providing high-quality products. Concentrated
production systems have issues of concern with respect to the
short- and long-term sustainability of California agriculture.
These issues include but are not limited to: 
<UL>
<LI>Waste management
<LI>Pathogen resistance to antibiotics
<LI>Natural resource use
<LI>Nutrient cycling
<LI>Input use
<LI>Animal welfare
<LI>Regulations
<LI>Labor use
<LI>Rural community effects 
</UL>

<P>
Proposals that address these issues or other factors related to
sustainable animal agriculture are invited.<BR>

<H3>Community Development and Public Policy </H3>

<P>
<I><B>Community Food Systems <BR>
</B></I>We are seeking to fund long-term, collaborative demonstrations
in particular places (i.e. a city, county, region, bioregion,
etc.) that take a holistic approach to developing a sustainable
community food system. SAREP funding could support new collaborations
or augment existing ones. The projects should work toward several
of the following goals and should be consistent with all of them:

<OL>
<LI>access by all community members to an adequate, affordable
diet of high nutritional value;
<LI>a stable base of family farms using production practices that
are less chemical and energy- intensive; 
<LI>marketing practices that create more direct and beneficial
links between farmers and consumers and to the extent possible
reduce the resources used to move food between production and
consumption; 
<LI>development of ag-related businesses that create jobs, recirculate
financial capital in the community, or in other ways contribute
to the community's economic development;
<LI>improved working and living conditions of farm labor such
that farmers and farmworkers can be fully contributing members
of the community; and 
<LI>public policies to encourage a community's transition to a
sustainable food and agricultural system by protecting farmland,
developing necessary infrastructure, and providing research and
technical assistance. 
</OL>

<P>
To be considered for a larger budget and/or a long-term commitment
of funding, proposals in this category should show clear evidence
of broad community support and involvement with the project, including
matching grants or in-kind contributions. Proposals should also
speak to the track record of project organizers in community-based
projects, identify tangible end products (reports, publications,
videos, etc.) that will result, and include a research or evaluation
component which produces tangible data on the project's economic
and social impacts on the community. 
<P>
<I><B>Marketing, Consumer Education and Community Food Security</B></I>
<BR>
We are seeking projects that facilitate direct marketing and/or
increase value-added returns to farmers; that develop or implement
strategies to educate consumers about their role in sustainable
food systems; or that improve access to fresh, affordable and
nutritious foods, particularly among low-income families in rural
and inner-city areas.
<P>
<I><B>Community Economic Development</B></I> <BR>
We are seeking projects that develop indicators, gather data,
and provide concrete analysis of how agricultural practices and
structures contribute to the viability or decline of California
communities; case studies of how the adoption of environmentally
sensitive agricultural production and marketing practices has
contributed or might contribute to community economic, social
and political development; or studies of how corporate concentration
and the emerging global economy impact the sustainability of California
agriculture.
<P>
<I><B>Public Policy<BR>
</B></I>We are seeking projects that develop concrete analyses
of the impact of federal, state and/or local government policies
and programs on the sustainability of agriculture in California;
develop criteria to assess current policies, and/or anticipate
the benefits, costs and political feasibility of policy alternatives;
create economic incentives that encourage growers, processors,
retailer and others to make the transition to sustainable agriculture;
or initiate Food Policy Councils as permanent institutional vehicles
for planning community food systems.
<P>
<I><B>Land Use and the Urban-Rural Interface</B></I> <BR>
We are seeking projects that address the threat to the sustainability
of California agriculture posed by rapid urban expansion on prime
soils and the potential for sustainable farming practices to help
ease this threat; that concretely document the existing and potential
impact of sustainable farming practices on agricultural conversion
patterns; or that promote mutual understanding and political cooperation
among urban residents and farmers.
<P>
<I><B>Labor Policies and Practices</B></I> <BR>
We are seeking research or community-based projects that improve
labor policies and practices to enhance sustainability, provide
critical data relating the conditions of agricultural labor to
the goals of sustainability; or use existing data to make comparisons
of how different farming practices impact labor; or otherwise
promote the full inclusion of agricultural laborers in decision-making
about the future of California agriculture.<BR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER>ELIGIBILITY AND FUNDING </CENTER></H3>

<P>
Eligible applicants include researchers affiliated with California
public and private institutions of higher education or with California
non-profit, tax-exempt organizations. SAREP staff and members
of SAREP's Public Advisory and Technical Advisory Committees are
not eligible to participate as principal investigator, investigator,
or cooperator on any project. Proposals will be rejected if they
involve investigators or cooperators who are on SAREP's Public
or Technical Advisory Committees. Current members are: PAC- Catherine
Brandel, Jenny Broome, Cynthia Cory, David Costa, Leonard Diggs,
Gail Gant, Marion Kalb, James Liebman, Ron Mansfield, Andrew Rubin,
Bryte Stewart, Michael Straus, Brock Taylor, Don Villarejo and
Angus Wright; TAC-Edith Allen, Tim Hartz, Scott Johnson, Don Klingborg,
Craig Kolodge, Juan Palerm, Terry Prichard, Janet Savage, Tom
Shultz, Rob Thayer, and Lucia Varela. 
<P>
We are interested in funding a variety of small projects, with
typical awards of $3,000-15,000, but larger budgets will be considered
if well justified. Larger awards are reserved for integrative
and interdisciplinary projects that involve teams of researchers,
or for projects that link a range of players and constituent groups
within agriculture and the food system. Continued funding of larger
grants will be dependent on provision of matching funds or in-kind
contributions. Total funding for all grants (new and continuing)
is expected to be around $170,000. A number of projects funded
in 1995-96 are expected to apply for continuation funding, and
we expect the competition to be strong for both new and continuing
proposals.
<P>
Multiple-year projects should indicate total length (number of
years) at the time of the original proposal, with a work plan
and budget for up to three years. 
<P>
<B>Note: </B>Requests for Proposals for Graduate Student Awards
and for Educational Events (meetings, demonstrations, and field
days) are being made in separate documents, with different formats
for the requested proposals. The due date for these proposals
is the same (August 1, 1996) and both RFPs can be obtained by

<CENTER><H1>A Request For Proposals</H1><P><H2>Extending Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS)</H2><H2>For Field Crops, Row Crops, Orchards, Vineyards</H2>U.C. Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (UC SAREP)<BR>University of California<BR>Davis, CA 95616<BR>916-752-7556<P><H3><I>Proposals Due: July 6, 1995</I></H3><P></CENTER>An increasing number of California farmers representing many commodities and counties have been able to maintain yields and quality while greatly reducing their reliance on agrichemicals, including pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. These farmers integrate the following elements into their production systems: <P><DL><OL><LI>Biological and cultural control of pests;<P><LI>	On-farm habitats for beneficial insects, mites, and spiders;<P><LI>	A strong emphasis on soil-building practices, often including biological nitrogen fixation to supply all or part of the nitrogen needed by crop plants;<P><LI>Reduced reliance on agricultural chemicals.</OL></DL><P> We call such production systems Biologically Integrated Farming Systems (BIFS). Many BIFS also employ additional tools, such as field monitoring for pest and beneficial organisms, collection of weather data, reliance on research-based action thresholds for decision making, use of selective biorational pesticides, and soil, water, and plant-tissue testing. BIFS are not necessarily limited to organic farming systems. Under BIFS management, agrichemical programs are crafted so as to interfere minimally with the integration of the elements mentioned above.<P> New legislation (Assembly Bill 3383) has enabled the University of California to award grants, for developing pilot demonstration projects for the purpose of extending BIFS methods. As described in the legislation, the projects will enable farmers to emulate regionally successful BIFS methodology. In essence, each funded project would be expected to transfer BIFS technology to 10-30 interested farmers, through technical support and farmer-to-farmer information sharing. The state legislature recognizes that a team outreach approach may help farmers learn and adapt integrated farming practices to local conditions most efficiently. To accomplish this, a management team of persons experienced in BIFS would provide technical support to a class of participating farmers. Such management teams should involve farmers, scientists, extension workers, and pest control advisers. Each applicant must outline a program which requires a maximum of 3 years of funding. Funds will be disbursed quarterly from invoices submitted. Renewed funding of ongoing projects contingent on demonstrated progress and available monies. Projects should be designed to be self-sufficient beyond the 3-year period. <P><B>Conflict of Interest Policy</B><BR>Members of Assembly Bill 3383 Program Advisory Review Board and UC SAREPs Public Advisory and Technical Advisory committees, and UC SAREP staff are not eligible to participate as Principal Investigator, Other Investigator, or Cooperator on any proposal for funding under this program. Proposals that involve the persons mentioned above will not be considered. <P><B>Eligibility</B><BR>Only individuals and institutions based in California may receive funding. The following people or groups are eligible to apply as principal investigator for a BIFS grant: private individuals, both for-profit and non-profit corporations, including commodity boards, Resource Conservation Districts, Natural Resources Conservation Service District or Soil Conservationists, University of California Cooperative Extension Farm Advisors, Cooperative Extension Specialists, Area IPM Advisors, and faculty of any accredited institution of higher learning in California. <P><B>Funding</B><BR>The funding for these awards is provided jointly by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Awards will range from $80,000 to $130,000 per year. <P><B>Use of Funds</B><BR>Principal expenditures should be for personnel, including the program coordinator, members of the management team, and persons who assist in field data collection and analysis. Funds may not be used for equipment purchases, unless these are clearly shown to be more economical than rentals. <P><B>Criteria</B><BR>The enabling legislation states that to the degree feasible, fundedprojects should be patterned after the Biologically Integrated OrchardSystems (BIOS) Project for almonds in Merced County (See <AHREF="#Appendix">Appendix</A>). Extension models other than BIOS may bemore appropriate in other crops, and we encourage applications which propose additional models for making BIFS accessible to farmers. <P> <DL><OL>The following principal criteria will be used to evaluate proposals:<P><LI> 	Has at least one Biologically Integrated Farming System, currentlyin use on a California farm, been identified that will serve as the template for the proposed outreach project?<P><P><LI> 	Have the practices employed on that BIFS farm been clearly documented? <P><P><LI> 	Does the proposed program address soil fertility, plant nutrition, and pest management decisions in the context of a whole system or at least multiple elements?<P><P><LI> 	Have the elements of the proposed BIFS technology been shown, through scientific studies, to reduce pest damage or incidence or to promote soil fertility?<P><P><LI> 	Does the proposed BIFS technology enable farmers to reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizer and biologically disruptive, non-selective pesticides? <P><P><LI> 	Does the proposal include a two- to three-year plan for extending BIFS to interested farmers and agricultural consultants?<P><P><LI> 	Has support been documented for the proposed BIFS outreach program from growers, appropriate commodity groups, and extension personnel? <P><P><LI>	Does the targeted conventional farming system employ relatively high total or per acre amounts of restricted-use pesticides, biologically disruptive, non-selective pesticides, or highly soluble nitrogen fertilizer? <P><P><LI>	Are current pest management strategies in the targeted conventional farming system threatened due to pest resistance, loss of pesticide registration, ineffective control, high costs or documented risk to health or the environment?<P></DL><P><B>Procedure and Timeline for Application, Evaluation, and Awards </B><BR>Twenty (20) copies of each proposal, typed, single-spaced, with 10 pt. font or larger, are due at U.C. Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (UC SAREP), University of California, (DANR Building, Hopkins Road) Davis, CA 95616 by July 6, 1995, at 5:00 P.M.

These must include the following:  <P><DL><B>A.</B>A roster of proposed members of the management team, includingaddresses, and phone numbers, with attachments documenting their experience and achievements in BIFS and signed letters of intent to serve. Each management team must include a project coordinator, at least one BIFS farmer, at least one pest control advisor, a U.C. faculty member, and a U.C. farm advisor or specialist. Any of the technical personnel mentioned can double as project coordinator. The role of management team members is to implement the proposed outreach program and to serve for its duration as resources for participating farmers (see <AHREF="#Appendix">Appendix</A> for additional details).<P><B>B.</B> 	Petition signed by 10-30 farmers of the relevant counties andfarming system, expressing willingness to participate. Participating farmers should represent a range of prior experience with elements of BIFS. However, all participating farmers must be willing to commit acreage as transitional parcels. Acreage may vary according to crop and local farm size. For orchard, vineyard, and field crops, 10-30 acres would be standard. For high-value row crops, lesser acreages may be appropriate. Signatory farmers must agree to implement recommendations to achieve biological integration and agrichemical use reduction, to monitor key variables, and to share data freely with other farmers, the management team, and the community at large. <P><B>C.</B> 	A draft calendar of possible field days for participatingfarmers and the general public (see <A HREF="#Appendix">Appendix</A> for examples).<P><B>D.</B> 	A description of the conventional farming system to beaddressed, specifying and documenting county yields, pest problems, use patterns for pesticides and fertilizers, and any associated environmental, health, or regulatory issues or concerns.<P></DL><B>VIII.</B> Optional attachments. Highest rankings will be assigned toproposals that fulfill the above requirements and also includeattachments documenting the following:<P><DL><B>A.</B> A proposed program ofcontinuing side-by-side comparisons between randomly chosen conventionally managed and BIFS blocks. <P><P><B>B.</B> Expressions of intent (signed letters or memoranda) to providematching contributions, rebates, or cost-sharing from other entities,for example, governmental agencies, academic institutions, non-profitorganizations, commodity groups, and private businesses.<P><B>C.</B> Letters of intent from scientists documenting piggybackresearch projects to be conducted in coordination with the proposed BIFS extension efforts. These projects could involve monitoring selected variables or evaluating proposed improvements to BIFS technology (see <AHREF="#Appendix">Appendix</A> for examples from the Merced County Almond BIOS Project). This criterion is not critical for the first years funding cycle, but will become important in ensuring renewed funding of projects in subsequent years.</DL><P><B>Publications and Annual Reports</B><BR>UC SAREP requires quarterly progress reports and one report at the end of each year of funding. The text format is 10 pt. font, double-spaced. The reports should include the following sections where appropriate: Summary, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Work Plan for Coming Year, References Cited, Tables, Figures, Attachments (including publications produced by and concerning the funded project). The reports should be provided in hard copy and on floppy diskette.<P><B>Evaluation and Renewal of Funding</B><BR>In total, projects can qualify for up to 3 years of funding. To qualify, a report must be submitted that confirms and documents continued grower participation and progress in agrichemical use reduction and adoption of BIFS practices, while maintaining yields and quality. Data may also be presented on adoption of BIFS technology by non-participating farmers who have been influenced by the outreach program. The report must include an updated work plan for the coming year. As mentioned above, documentation of increasing matching contributions and numbers of piggyback scientific studies will be increasingly important criteria for renewed funding. Evidence of continual enrichment and refinement of BIFS technology will also be an important criterion, as will continuing side-by-side comparisons of BIFS and conventional practices. The reports will be evaluated by the Program Review Advisory Board, with final decisions on renewed funding being made by the Director of UC SAREP.<P><B>Further Information</B><BR>For further information, contact Robert L.

Interested farmers applied to CAFF Foundation, and a subset of applicants were chosen as participants so as to represent a range of farming practices, soil conditions, locales, and level of experience with biologically integrated farming.  CAFF Foundation assembled a consortium of farmers, U.C. scientists and extension workers, private agricultural consultants, private corporations, and governmental agencies to provide a package of technical and financial support to these participants. <P><B>Technical Support and Evaluation</B><BR>BIOS projects are intended to provide a continually enriched and updated package of technical support, and to evaluate the progress of participating farmers in adopting the suggested techniques and at maintaining yields and quality.  Elements are as follows:<DL><LI> A customized plan for each transitional parcel developed in consultation with the farmer and his or her pest control adviser (PCA) by a "Management Team" of experienced BIOS farmers, a U.C. Cooperative Extension Farm Advisor, and a researcher.<P><LI> A coordinated program of pest monitoring for each parcel, based in part on guidelines from the University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management (U.C.I.P.M.) Project and developed in consultation with the Management Team and the cooperating PCAs.<P><LI>Customized monitoring program to assess orchard ecology, including cover crop growth, density of earthworms, beneficial arthropods in cover crops in the almond canopy, and pest and beneficial arthropods inside the almonds. <P><LI> Before/after and side-by-side comparison of BIOS and conventional almond orchard blocks.<P><LI> A newsletter summarizing the results of the monitoring and current field conditions sent regularly to participating farmers and PCAs. <P><LI> Consulting services (including a hot line) throughout the season to answer questions concerning the transitional process and to trouble-shoot difficulties that arise.<P><LI> Monthly problem-solving meetings or on-farm workshops, seminars, and facilitated focus sessions.  Topics have included identification and management of pathogens, arthropod pests, beneficial insects, cover crops, resident vegetation, and earthworms; compost quality and use; soil structure as related to cover cropping and soil-borne pathogens; dynamics of soil organic matter; tree nutrition; pruning methods; methods of chipping prunings; owl and bat management; etc.  Upcoming sessions will concern nitrogen cycling in Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems, domestic and wild pollinator insects of almonds, and spray oils, <P><LI> A "BIOS Document" presenting the technical details, scientific background, and trade-offs implicit in the production system.<P><LI> A "BIOS Reader" comprising reprints of technical articles, periodically updated and augmented, supplied to participating farmers and their pest control advisers.<P><LI> Certification credit for pest control advisers and other agricultural consultants who attend BIOS field days and workshops.<P><LI>Evaluation of adoption of BIOS practices by participating farmers. </DL><P><B>Financial Incentives</B><BR>Financial incentives to participating BIOS farmers include thefollowing: <P><DL><LI> Subsidies of up to $20 per acre were available through the U.S.D.A. Consolidated Farm Service SP53 program, administered through the local Resource Conservation District. These subsidies are contingent on the farmer demonstrating a 20% reduction in nitrogen fertilizer or pesticide application.  <P><LI> Cost-sharing and rebates were available through various corporate sponsors for cover crop seed, beneficial insects and mites, insectary shrubs and trees, insect traps, laboratory services, farm implements, and microbial preparations for bioremediation of pre-emergence herbicides.</DL><P><B>A Summary of Features of The BIOS Model</B><BR>The following characteristics of the BIOS model enable comparison to other extension models.  The BIOS model:<P><DL><LI>Addresses farmers directly, as well as pest control advisers and other agricultural consultants.<P><LI>Targets whole production systems.<P><LI>Does not assume a strict top-down, teacher-student relationship whereby specialists impart knowledge to farmers or PCAs.  Rather, the model emphasizes developing a co-learning environment wherein farmers, researchers, and agricultural consultants share insights.<P><LI>External structure is provided by CAFF Foundation.<P><LI>Programmed instruction on a specific type of production system, and the adaptation of the system to individual farms.</DL><BR><B>Piggyback Scientific and Economic Studies</B><BR>The Merced County Almond BIOS Project currently hosts three piggyback scientific studies:<BR><DL><LI>Evaluation of use of nectar-bearing plants by parasitic and predatory insects through rubidium labelling, conducted by Dr. Andrew Corbett of the Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis.<P><LI>Evaluation of the decomposition of cover crop residues and resultant nitrogen mineralization, conducted by Robert McGuinn and Dr. Alison Berry of the Department of Environmental Horticulture,  University of California, Davis. <P><LI>Evaluation of pheromonal confusants for mating disruption of navel orangeworm, conducted by Walt Bentley, Area Advisor with the University of California Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project.<P><LI>Dr. Karen Klonsky of the Department of Agricultural Economics is conducting an economic comparison of BIOS and conventional almond production. </DL><P><B>First-Year Results from Merced County</B><BR>Under BIOS management, first-year survey results, though still incomplete, suggest that most participating Merced County almond growers eliminated organophosphate and pyrethroid dormant sprays, and substantially reduced herbicide and synthetic N fertilizer use.  Data are available for yields and pest damage obtained in ongoing side-by-side comparisons of BIOS and conventionally managed blocks, for before/after comparisons of synthetic N applications, use of pesticides targeted for reduction by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and adoption of BIOS techniques by participating farmers.<P>For further information on the BIOS projects, consult Thomas Nelson,Community Alliance with Family Farmers Foundation, P.O.

<h2><a name="what">What</a> is a Community Food System?</h2>
<p>A community food system is a collaborative effort in a particular place to build more locally-based, self-reliant food economies. 
Community food systems seek comprehensive solutions to food and agricultural problems by involving community members in 
promoting: community food security; farmland preservation; local, direct marketing; community economic development; a stable base 
of family farmers that use production practices that are less chemical and energy-intensive; improved working and living conditions 
for farm labor; and public policies and planning that encourage a more sustainable food system. </p>
<h2><a name="who">Who</a> Should Attend?</h2>
<p>This conference is intended for a diverse audience, including representatives of community-based organizations, Cooperative 
Extension, farmers, University faculty, anti-hunger and food security representatives, farmers' market personnel, consumers, 
community gardeners, economic development planners, local government officials, church groups, environmentalists and others 
interested in developing a more locally-based, self-reliant food system. </p>
<h2>Conference <a name="features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenging keynote addresses that articulate the role of community food systems in the midst of the global food economy, </li>
<li>Panel presentations of innovative community food system projects from across California, including SAREP-funded projects, </li>
<li>Plenaries that describe coalitions, institutions and businesses that can promote the long-term sustainability of community food 
systems, </li>
<li>Workshops in which to learn and share practical skills for developing community food systems, </li>
<li>Time for networking and building bridges of cooperation among allies, </li>
<li>Social time, food, culture and entertainment at the famous Davis Farmers' Market, and </li>
<li>Delicious lunches prepared from locally grown foods </li>
</ul>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>griculture has changed dramatically, especially 
since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity soared due to new 
technologies, mechanization, increased chemical use, specialization 
and government policies that favored maximizing production. These 
changes allowed fewer farmers with reduced labor demands to produce 
the majority of the food and fiber in the U.S.<P> 
Although these changes have had many positive effects and reduced 
many risks in farming, there have also been significant 
costs.Prominent among these are topsoil depletion, groundwater 
contamination, the decline of family farms, continued neglect of 
the living and working conditions for farm laborers, increasing 
costs of production, and the disintegration of economic and social 
conditions in rural communities.<P> 
 
A growing movement has emerged during the past two decades to 
question the role of the agricultural establishment in promoting 
practices that contribute to these social problems. Today this 
movement for sustainable agriculture is garnering increasing 
support and acceptance within mainstream agriculture. Not only does 
sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social 
concerns, but it offers innovative and economically viable 
opportunities for growers, laborers, consumers, policymakers and 
many others in the entire food system.<P> 
This paper is an effort to identify the ideas, practices and 
policies that constitute our concept of sustainable agriculture. We 
do so for two reasons: 1) to clarify the research agenda and 
priorities of our program, and 2) to suggest to others practical 
steps that may be appropriate for them in moving toward sustainable 
agriculture.Because the concept of sustainable agriculture is still 
evolving, we intend the paper not as a definitive or final 
statement, but as an invitation to continue the dialogue.<P>  
 
<A NAME="Themes"><H2>Concept Themes</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
Sustainable agriculture integrates three main 
goals--environmental health, economic profitability, and social 
and economic equity. A variety of philosophies, policies and 
practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different 
capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and 
contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and 
perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through 
definitions of sustainable agriculture.<P> 
Sustainability rests on the principle that we must meet the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. Therefore, <EM>stewardship of both 
natural and human resources</EM> is of prime importance. Stewardship of 
human resources includes consideration of social responsibilities 
such as working and living conditions of laborers, the needs of 
rural communities, and consumer health and safety both in the 
present and the future. Stewardship of land and natural resources 
involves maintaining or enhancing this vital resource base for the 
long term.<P>  
A <EM>systems perspective</EM> is essential to understanding sustainability. 
The system is envisioned in its broadest sense, from the individual 
farm, to the local ecosystem, <EM>and</EM> to communities affected by this 
farming system both locally and globally. An emphasis on the system 
allows a larger and more thorough view of the consequences of 
farming practices on both human communities and the environment. A 
systems approach gives us the tools to explore the interconnections 
between farming and other aspects of our environment.<P> 
 
A systems approach also implies <EM>interdisciplinary efforts in 
research and education</EM>. This requires not only the input of 
researchers from various disciplines, but also farmers, 
farmworkers, consumers, policymakers and others. <P> 
 
<EM>Making the transition to sustainable agriculture is a process</EM>. For 
farmers, the transition to sustainable agriculture normally 
requires a series of small, realistic steps. Family economics and 
personal goals influence how fast or how far participants can go in 
the transition. It is important to realize that each small decision 
can make a difference and contribute to advancing the entire system 
further on the "sustainable agriculture continuum." The key 
to moving forward is the will to take the next step.<P> 
 
Finally, it is important to point out that <EM>reaching toward the goal 
of sustainable agriculture is the responsibility of all 
participants in the system</EM>, including farmers, laborers, 
policymakers, researchers, retailers, and consumers. Each group has 
its own part to play, its own unique contribution to make to 
strengthen the sustainable agriculture community.<P> 
 
The remainder of this document considers specific strategies for 
realizing these broad themes or goals.  The strategies are grouped 
according to three separate though related areas of concern: 
Farming and Natural Resources, Plant and Animal Production 
Practices, and the Economic, Social and Political Context. They 
represent a range of potential ideas for individuals committed to 
interpreting the vision of sustainable agriculture within their own 
circumstances.<P> 
 
<A NAME="NaturalResources"><H2>Farming and Natural Resources</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
<STRONG>Water.</STRONG> When the production of food and fiber degrades the natural 
resource base, the ability of future generations to produce and 
flourish decreases. The decline of ancient civilizations in 
Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean region, Pre-Columbian southwest U.S. 
and Central America is believed to have been strongly influenced by 
natural resource degradation from non-sustainable farming and 
forestry practices. Water is the principal resource that has helped 
agriculture and society to prosper, and it has been a major 
limiting factor when mismanaged.<P> 
 
<EM>Water supply and use.</EM> In California, an extensive water storage and 
transfer system has been established which has allowed crop 
production to expand to very arid regions. In drought years, 
limited surface water supplies have prompted overdraft of 
groundwater and consequent intrusion of salt water, or permanent 
collapse of aquifers. Periodic droughts, some lasting up to 50 
years, have occurred in California. Several steps should be taken 
to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in "normal" 
years, including both policy and management actions: 1) improving 
water conservation and storage measures, 2) providing incentives 
for selection of drought-tolerant crop species, 3) using 
reduced-volume irrigation systems, 4) managing crops to reduce 
water loss, or 5) not planting at all.<P> 
 
<EM>Water quality.</EM> The most important issues related to water quality 
involve salinization and contamination of ground and surface waters 
by pesticides, nitrates and selenium. Salinity has become a problem 
wherever water of even relatively low salt content is used on 
shallow soils in arid regions and/or where the water table is near 
the root zone of crops. Tile drainage can remove the water and 
salts, but the disposal of the salts and other contaminants may 
negatively affect the environment depending upon where they are 
deposited. Temporary solutions include the use of salt-tolerant 
crops, low-volume irrigation, and various management techniques to 
minimize the effects of salts on crops. In the long-term, some 
farmland may need to be removed from production or converted to 
other uses. Other uses include conversion of row crop land to 
production of drought-tolerant forages, the restoration of wildlife 
habitat or the use of agroforestry to minimize the impacts of 
salinity and high water tables. Pesticide and nitrate contamination 
of water can be reduced using many of the practices discussed later 
in the <A HREF="#PlantPractices">Plant Production 
Practices</A> and <A HREF="#AnimalPractices">Animal Production 
Practices</A> sections.<P> 
 <IMG SRC="/Images/random/owl.jpg" ALT="Image: Owl"  WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=213 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT>

<EM>Wildlife.</EM> Another way in which agriculture affects water resources 
is through the destruction of riparian habitats within watersheds. 
The conversion of wild habitat to agricultural land reduces fish 
and wildlife through erosion and sedimentation, the effects of 
pesticides, removal of riparian plants, and the diversion of water. 
The plant diversity in and around both riparian and agricultural 
areas should be maintained in order to support a diversity of 
wildlife. This diversity will enhance natural ecosystems and could 
aid in agricultural pest management.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Energy.</STRONG> Modern agriculture is heavily dependent on non-renewable 
energy sources, especially petroleum. The continued use of these 
energy sources cannot be sustained indefinitely, yet to abruptly 
abandon our reliance on them would be economically catastrophic. 
However, a sudden cutoff in energy supply would be equally 
disruptive. In sustainable agricultural systems, there is reduced 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources and a substitution of 
renewable sources or labor to the extent that is economically 
feasible.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Air.</STRONG> Many agricultural activities affect air quality.  These 
include smoke from agricultural burning; dust from tillage, traffic 
and harvest; pesticide drift from spraying; and nitrous oxide 
emissions from the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Options to improve 
air quality include incorporating crop residue into the soil, using 
appropriate levels of tillage, and planting wind breaks, cover 
crops or strips of native perennial grasses to reduce dust.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Soil.</STRONG> Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to our 
continued ability to produce adequate food. Numerous practices have 
been developed to keep soil in place, which include reducing or 
eliminating tillage, managing irrigation to reduce runoff, and 
keeping the soil covered with plants or mulch. Enhancement of soil 
quality is discussed in the next section. <P> 
 
<A NAME="PlantPractices"><H2>Plant Production Practices</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
Sustainable production practices involve a variety of approaches. 
Specific strategies must take into account topography, soil 
characteristics, climate, pests, local availability of inputs and 
the individual grower's goals. Despite the site-specific and 
individual nature of sustainable agriculture, several general 
principles can be applied to help growers select appropriate 
management practices: 
 
<UL> 
	<LI>Selection of species and varieties that are well suited to the site 
and to conditions on the farm; 
	<LI>Diversification of crops (including livestock) and cultural 
practices to enhance the biological and economic stability of the farm; 
	<LI>Management of the soil to enhance and protect soil quality; 
	<LI>Efficient and humane use of inputs; and 
	<LI>Consideration of farmers' goals and lifestyle choices. 
</UL> 
 
<STRONG>Selection of site, species and variety.</STRONG> Preventive strategies, 
adopted early, can reduce inputs and help establish a sustainable 
production system. When possible, pest-resistant crops should be 
selected which are tolerant of existing soil or site conditions. 
When site selection is an option, factors such as soil type and 
depth, previous crop history, and location (e.g. climate, 
topography) should be taken into account before planting.<P> 
   
<STRONG>Diversity.</STRONG> Diversified farms are usually more economically and 
ecologically resilient. While monoculture farming has advantages in 
terms of efficiency and ease of management, the loss of the crop in 
any one year could put a farm out of business and/or seriously 
disrupt the stability of a community dependent on that crop. By 
growing a variety of crops, farmers spread economic risk and are 
less susceptible to the radical price fluctuations associated with 
changes in supply and demand.  <P> 


 
<IMG SRC="/Images/random/close_up.jpg" ALT="Image: Vetch"  WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=186 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT>




Properly managed, diversity can also buffer a farm in a biological 
sense. For example, in annual cropping systems, crop rotation can 
be used to suppress weeds, pathogens and insect pests. Also, cover 
crops can have stabilizing effects on the agroecosystem by holding 
soil and nutrients in place, conserving soil moisture with mowed or 
standing dead mulches, and by increasing the water infiltration 
rate and soil water holding capacity. Cover crops in orchards and 
vineyards can buffer the system against pest infestations by 
increasing beneficial arthropod populations and can therefore 
reduce the need for chemical inputs. Using a variety of cover crops 
is also important in order to protect against the failure of a 
particular species to grow and to attract and sustain a wide range 
of beneficial arthropods.<P> 
 
Optimum diversity may be obtained by integrating both crops and 
livestock in the same farming operation. This was the common 
practice for centuries until the mid-1900s when technology, 
government policy and economics compelled farms to become more 
specialized. Mixed crop and livestock operations have several 
advantages. First, growing row crops only on more level land and 
pasture or forages on steeper slopes will reduce soil erosion. 
Second, pasture and forage crops in rotation enhance soil quality 
and reduce erosion; livestock manure, in turn, contributes to soil 
fertility. Third, livestock can buffer the negative impacts of low 
rainfall periods by consuming crop residue that in "plant only" 
systems would have been considered crop failures. Finally, feeding 
and marketing are flexible in animal production systems. This can 
help cushion farmers against trade and price fluctuations and, in 
conjunction with cropping operations, make more efficient use of 
farm labor. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Soil management.</STRONG>  A common philosophy among sustainable agriculture 
practitioners is that a "healthy" soil is a key component 
of sustainability; that is, a healthy soil will produce healthy 
crop plants that have optimum vigor and are less susceptible to 
pests. While many crops have key pests that attack even the 
healthiest of plants, proper soil, water and nutrient management 
can help prevent some pest problems brought on by crop stress or 
nutrient imbalance. Furthermore, crop management systems that 
impair soil quality often result in greater inputs of water, 
nutrients, pesticides, and/or energy for tillage to maintain 
yields.<P> 
 
In sustainable systems, the soil is viewed as a fragile and living 
medium that must be protected and nurtured to ensure its long-term 
productivity and stability. Methods to protect and enhance the 
productivity of the soil include using cover crops, compost and/or 
manures, reducing tillage, avoiding traffic on wet soils, and 
maintaining soil cover with plants and/or mulches. Conditions in 
most California soils (warm, irrigated, and tilled) do not favor 
the buildup of organic matter. Regular additions of organic matter 
or the use of cover crops can increase soil aggregate stability, 
soil tilth, and diversity of soil microbial life.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Efficient use of inputs.</STRONG> Many inputs and practices used by 
conventional farmers are also used in sustainable agriculture. 
Sustainable farmers, however, maximize reliance on natural, 
renewable, and on-farm inputs. Equally important are the 
environmental, social, and economic impacts of a particular 
strategy. Converting to sustainable practices does not mean simple 
input substitution. Frequently, it substitutes enhanced management 
and scientific knowledge for conventional inputs, especially 
chemical inputs that harm the environment on farms and in rural 
communities. The goal is to develop efficient, biological systems 
which do not need high levels of material inputs.<P> 
 
Growers frequently ask if synthetic chemicals are appropriate in a 
sustainable farming system. Sustainable approaches are those that 
are the least toxic and least energy intensive, and yet maintain 
productivity and profitability. Preventive strategies and other 
alternatives should be employed before using chemical inputs from 
any source. However, there may be situations where the use of 
synthetic chemicals would be more "sustainable" than a strictly 
nonchemical approach or an approach using toxic "organic" 
chemicals. For example, one grape grower switched from tillage to 
a few applications of a broad spectrum contact herbicide in the 
vine row.  This approach may use less energy and may compact the 
soil less than numerous passes with a cultivator or mower.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consideration of farmer goals and lifestyle choices.</STRONG>  Management 
decisions should reflect not only environmental and broad social 
considerations, but also individual goals and lifestyle choices. 
For example, adoption of some technologies or practices that 
promise profitability may also require such intensive management 
that one's lifestyle actually deteriorates. Management decisions 
that promote sustainability, nourish the environment, the community 
<EM>and</EM> the individual.<P> 
 
<A NAME="AnimalPractices"><H2>Animal Production Practices</H2></A> 
 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
In the early part of this century, most farms integrated both crop 
and livestock operations. Indeed, the two were highly complementary 
both biologically and economically. The current picture has changed 
quite drastically since then. Crop and animal producers now are 
still dependent on one another to some degree, but the integration 
now most commonly takes place at a higher level--<EM>between</EM> farmers, 
through intermediaries, rather than <EM>within</EM> the farm itself. This is 
the result of a trend toward separation and specialization of crop 
and animal production systems. Despite this trend, there are still 
many farmers, particularly in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. 
that integrate crop and animal systems--either on dairy farms, or 
with range cattle, sheep or hog operations.<P> 
 
Even with the growing specialization of livestock and crop 
producers, many of the principles outlined in the crop production 
section apply to both groups. The actual management practices will, 
of course, be quite different.  Some of the specific points that 
livestock producers need to address are listed below.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Management Planning.</STRONG> Including livestock in the farming system 
increases the complexity of biological and economic relationships. 
The mobility of the stock, daily feeding, health concerns, breeding 
operations, seasonal feed and forage sources, and complex marketing 
are sources of this complexity. Therefore, a successful ranch plan 
should include enterprise calendars of operations, stock flows, 
forage flows, labor needs, herd production records and land use 
plans to give the manager control and a means of monitoring 
progress toward goals.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Animal Selection.</STRONG> The animal enterprise must be appropriate for the 
farm or ranch resources. Farm capabilities and constraints such as 
feed and forage sources, landscape, climate and skill of the 
manager must be considered in selecting which animals to produce. 
For example, ruminant animals can be raised on a variety of feed 
sources including range and pasture, cultivated forage, cover 
crops, shrubs, weeds, and crop residues. There is a wide range of 
breeds available in each of the major ruminant species, i.e., 
cattle, sheep and goats.  Hardier breeds that, in general, have 
lower growth and milk production potential, are better adapted to 
less favorable environments with sparse or highly seasonal forage 
growth. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Animal nutrition.</STRONG> Feed costs are the largest single variable cost 
in any livestock operation. While most of the feed may come from 
other enterprises on the ranch, some purchased feed is usually 
imported from off the farm. Feed costs can be kept to a minimum by 
monitoring animal condition and performance and understanding 
seasonal variations in feed and forage quality on the farm. 
Determining the optimal use of farm-generated by-products is an 
important challenge of diversified farming.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Reproduction.</STRONG> Use of quality germplasm to improve herd performance 
is another key to sustainability. In combination with good genetic 
stock, adapting the reproduction season to fit the climate and 
sources of feed and forage reduce health problems and feed costs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Herd Health.</STRONG> Animal health greatly influences reproductive success 
and weight gains, two key aspects of successful livestock 
production. Unhealthy stock waste feed and require additional 
labor. A herd health program is critical to sustainable livestock 
production.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Grazing Management.</STRONG> Most adverse environmental impacts associated 
with grazing can be prevented or mitigated with proper grazing 
management. First, the number of stock per unit area (stocking 
rate) must be correct for the landscape and the forage sources.   
There will need to be compromises between the convenience of 
tilling large, unfenced fields and the fencing needs of livestock 
operations. Use of modern, temporary fencing may provide one 
practical solution to this dilemma.  Second, the long term carrying 
capacity and the stocking rate must take into account short and 
long-term droughts.  Especially in Mediterranean climates such as 
in California, properly managed grazing significantly reduces fire 
hazards by reducing fuel build-up in grasslands and brushlands. 
Finally, the manager must achieve sufficient control to reduce 
overuse in some areas while other areas go unused. Prolonged 
concentration of stock that results in permanent loss of vegetative 
cover on uplands or in riparian zones should be avoided. However, 
small scale loss of vegetative cover around water or feed troughs 
may be tolerated if surrounding vegetative cover is adequate.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Confined Livestock Production.</STRONG> Animal health and waste management 
are key issues in confined livestock operations. The moral and 
ethical debate taking place today regarding animal welfare is 
particularly intense for confined livestock production systems. The 
issues raised in this debate need to be addressed.<P> 
  
Confinement livestock production is increasingly a source of 
surface and ground water pollutants, particularly where there are 
large numbers of animals per unit area. Expensive waste management 
facilities are now a necessary cost of confined production systems.  
Waste is a problem of almost all operations and must be managed 
with respect to both the environment and the quality of life in 
nearby communities. Livestock production systems that disperse 
stock in pastures so the wastes are not concentrated and do not 
overwhelm natural nutrient cycling processes have become a subject 
of renewed interest.<P> 
  
<A NAME="Context"><H2>The Economic, Social & Political Context</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
In addition to strategies for preserving natural resources and 
changing production practices, sustainable agriculture requires a 
commitment to changing public policies, economic institutions, and 
social values. Strategies for change must take into account the 
complex, reciprocal and ever-changing relationship between 
agricultural production and the broader society.<P> 
 
The "food system" extends far beyond the farm and involves the 
interaction of individuals and institutions with contrasting and 
often competing goals including farmers, researchers, input 
suppliers, farmworkers, unions, farm advisors, processors, 
retailers, consumers, and policymakers. Relationships among these 
actors shift over time as new technologies spawn economic, social 
and political changes.<P> 
 
A wide diversity of strategies and approaches are necessary to 
create a more sustainable food system. These will range from 
specific and concentrated efforts to alter specific policies or 
practices, to the longer-term tasks of reforming key institutions, 
rethinking economic priorities, and challenging widely-held social 
values. Areas of concern where change is most needed include the 
following:<P> 
 
<STRONG>Food and agricultural policy.</STRONG> Existing federal, state and local 
government policies often impede the goals of sustainable 
agriculture. New policies are needed to simultaneously promote 
environmental health, economic profitability, and social and 
economic equity. For example, commodity and price support programs 
could be restructured to allow farmers to realize the full benefits 
of the productivity gains made possible through alternative 
practices. Tax and credit policies could be modified to encourage 
a diverse and decentralized system of family farms rather than 
corporate concentration and absentee ownership. Government and land 
grant university research policies could be modified to emphasize 
the development of sustainable alternatives. Marketing orders and 
cosmetic standards could be amended to encourage reduced pesticide 
use. Coalitions must be created to address these policy concerns at 
the local, regional, and national level.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Land use.</STRONG> Conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is a 
particular concern in California, as rapid growth and escalating 
land values threaten farming on prime soils. Existing farmland 
conversion patterns often discourage farmers from adopting 
sustainable practices and a long-term perspective on the value of 
land. At the same time, the close proximity of newly developed 
residential areas to farms is increasing the public demand for 
environmentally safe farming practices. Comprehensive new policies 
to protect prime soils and regulate development are needed, 
particularly in California's Central Valley. By helping farmers to 
adopt practices that reduce chemical use and conserve scarce 
resources, sustainable agriculture research and education can play 
a key role in building public support for agricultural land 
preservation. Educating land use planners and decision-makers about 
sustainable agriculture is an important priority. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Labor.</STRONG> In California, the conditions of agricultural labor are 
generally far below accepted social standards and legal protections 
in other forms of employment. Policies and programs are needed to 
address this problem, working toward socially just and safe 
employment that provides adequate wages, working conditions, health 
benefits, and chances for economic stability. The needs of migrant 
labor for year-around employment and adequate housing are a 
particularly crucial problem needing immediate attention. To be 
more sustainable over the long-term, labor must be acknowledged and 
supported by government policies, recognized as important 
constituents of land grant universities, and carefully considered 
when assessing the impacts of new technologies and practices.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Rural Community Development.</STRONG> Rural communities in California are 
currently characterized by economic and environmental 
deterioration. Many are among the poorest locations in the nation. 
The reasons for the decline are complex, but changes in farm 
structure have played a significant role. Sustainable agriculture 
presents an opportunity to rethink the importance of family farms 
and rural communities. Economic development policies are needed 
that encourage more diversified agricultural production on family 
farms as a foundation for healthy economies in rural communities. 
In combination with other strategies, sustainable agriculture 
practices and policies can help foster community institutions that 
meet employment, educational, health, cultural and spiritual needs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consumers and the Food System.</STRONG>  Consumers can play a critical role in 
creating a sustainable food system. Through their purchases, they 
send strong messages to producers, retailers and others in the 
system about what they think is important. Food cost and 
nutritional quality have always influenced consumer choices. The 
challenge now is to find strategies that broaden consumer 
perspectives, so that environmental quality, resource use, and 
social equity issues are also considered in shopping decisions. At 
the same time, new policies and institutions must be created to 
enable producers using sustainable practices to market their goods 
to a wider public. Coalitions organized around improving the food 
system are one specific method of creating a dialogue among 
consumers, retailers, producers and others. These coalitions or 
other public forums can be important vehicles for clarifying 
issues, suggesting new policies, increasing mutual trust, and 
encouraging a long-term view of food production, distribution and 
consumption.<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>griculture has changed dramatically, especially 
since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity soared due to new 
technologies, mechanization, increased chemical use, specialization 
and government policies that favored maximizing production. These 
changes allowed fewer farmers with reduced labor demands to produce 
the majority of the food and fiber in the U.S.<P> 
Although these changes have had many positive effects and reduced 
many risks in farming, there have also been significant 
costs.Prominent among these are topsoil depletion, groundwater 
contamination, the decline of family farms, continued neglect of 
the living and working conditions for farm laborers, increasing 
costs of production, and the disintegration of economic and social 
conditions in rural communities.<P> 
 
A growing movement has emerged during the past two decades to 
question the role of the agricultural establishment in promoting 
practices that contribute to these social problems. Today this 
movement for sustainable agriculture is garnering increasing 
support and acceptance within mainstream agriculture. Not only does 
sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social 
concerns, but it offers innovative and economically viable 
opportunities for growers, laborers, consumers, policymakers and 
many others in the entire food system.<P> 
This paper is an effort to identify the ideas, practices and 
policies that constitute our concept of sustainable agriculture. We 
do so for two reasons: 1) to clarify the research agenda and 
priorities of our program, and 2) to suggest to others practical 
steps that may be appropriate for them in moving toward sustainable 
agriculture.Because the concept of sustainable agriculture is still 
evolving, we intend the paper not as a definitive or final 
statement, but as an invitation to continue the dialogue.<P>  
 
<A NAME="Themes"><H2>Concept Themes</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
Sustainable agriculture integrates three main 
goals--environmental health, economic profitability, and social 
and economic equity. A variety of philosophies, policies and 
practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different 
capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and 
contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and 
perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through 
definitions of sustainable agriculture.<P> 
Sustainability rests on the principle that we must meet the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. Therefore, <EM>stewardship of both 
natural and human resources</EM> is of prime importance. Stewardship of 
human resources includes consideration of social responsibilities 
such as working and living conditions of laborers, the needs of 
rural communities, and consumer health and safety both in the 
present and the future. Stewardship of land and natural resources 
involves maintaining or enhancing this vital resource base for the 
long term.<P>  
A <EM>systems perspective</EM> is essential to understanding sustainability. 
The system is envisioned in its broadest sense, from the individual 
farm, to the local ecosystem, <EM>and</EM> to communities affected by this 
farming system both locally and globally. An emphasis on the system 
allows a larger and more thorough view of the consequences of 
farming practices on both human communities and the environment. A 
systems approach gives us the tools to explore the interconnections 
between farming and other aspects of our environment.<P> 
 
A systems approach also implies <EM>interdisciplinary efforts in 
research and education</EM>. This requires not only the input of 
researchers from various disciplines, but also farmers, 
farmworkers, consumers, policymakers and others. <P> 
 
<EM>Making the transition to sustainable agriculture is a process</EM>. For 
farmers, the transition to sustainable agriculture normally 
requires a series of small, realistic steps. Family economics and 
personal goals influence how fast or how far participants can go in 
the transition. It is important to realize that each small decision 
can make a difference and contribute to advancing the entire system 
further on the "sustainable agriculture continuum." The key 
to moving forward is the will to take the next step.<P> 
 
Finally, it is important to point out that <EM>reaching toward the goal 
of sustainable agriculture is the responsibility of all 
participants in the system</EM>, including farmers, laborers, 
policymakers, researchers, retailers, and consumers. Each group has 
its own part to play, its own unique contribution to make to 
strengthen the sustainable agriculture community.<P> 
 
The remainder of this document considers specific strategies for 
realizing these broad themes or goals.  The strategies are grouped 
according to three separate though related areas of concern: 
Farming and Natural Resources, Plant and Animal Production 
Practices, and the Economic, Social and Political Context. They 
represent a range of potential ideas for individuals committed to 
interpreting the vision of sustainable agriculture within their own 
circumstances.<P> 
 
<A NAME="NaturalResources"><H2>Farming and Natural Resources</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
<STRONG>Water.</STRONG> When the production of food and fiber degrades the natural 
resource base, the ability of future generations to produce and 
flourish decreases. The decline of ancient civilizations in 
Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean region, Pre-Columbian southwest U.S. 
and Central America is believed to have been strongly influenced by 
natural resource degradation from non-sustainable farming and 
forestry practices. Water is the principal resource that has helped 
agriculture and society to prosper, and it has been a major 
limiting factor when mismanaged.<P> 
 
<EM>Water supply and use.</EM> In California, an extensive water storage and 
transfer system has been established which has allowed crop 
production to expand to very arid regions. In drought years, 
limited surface water supplies have prompted overdraft of 
groundwater and consequent intrusion of salt water, or permanent 
collapse of aquifers. Periodic droughts, some lasting up to 50 
years, have occurred in California. Several steps should be taken 
to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in "normal" 
years, including both policy and management actions: 1) improving 
water conservation and storage measures, 2) providing incentives 
for selection of drought-tolerant crop species, 3) using 
reduced-volume irrigation systems, 4) managing crops to reduce 
water loss, or 5) not planting at all.<P> 
 
<EM>Water quality.</EM> The most important issues related to water quality 
involve salinization and contamination of ground and surface waters 
by pesticides, nitrates and selenium. Salinity has become a problem 
wherever water of even relatively low salt content is used on 
shallow soils in arid regions and/or where the water table is near 
the root zone of crops. Tile drainage can remove the water and 
salts, but the disposal of the salts and other contaminants may 
negatively affect the environment depending upon where they are 
deposited. Temporary solutions include the use of salt-tolerant 
crops, low-volume irrigation, and various management techniques to 
minimize the effects of salts on crops. In the long-term, some 
farmland may need to be removed from production or converted to 
other uses. Other uses include conversion of row crop land to 
production of drought-tolerant forages, the restoration of wildlife 
habitat or the use of agroforestry to minimize the impacts of 
salinity and high water tables. Pesticide and nitrate contamination 
of water can be reduced using many of the practices discussed later 
in the <A HREF="#PlantPractices">Plant Production 
Practices</A> and <A HREF="#AnimalPractices">Animal Production 
Practices</A> sections.<P> 
 <IMG SRC="/Images/random/owl.jpg" ALT="Image: Owl"  WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=213 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT>

<EM>Wildlife.</EM> Another way in which agriculture affects water resources 
is through the destruction of riparian habitats within watersheds. 
The conversion of wild habitat to agricultural land reduces fish 
and wildlife through erosion and sedimentation, the effects of 
pesticides, removal of riparian plants, and the diversion of water. 
The plant diversity in and around both riparian and agricultural 
areas should be maintained in order to support a diversity of 
wildlife. This diversity will enhance natural ecosystems and could 
aid in agricultural pest management.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Energy.</STRONG> Modern agriculture is heavily dependent on non-renewable 
energy sources, especially petroleum. The continued use of these 
energy sources cannot be sustained indefinitely, yet to abruptly 
abandon our reliance on them would be economically catastrophic. 
However, a sudden cutoff in energy supply would be equally 
disruptive. In sustainable agricultural systems, there is reduced 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources and a substitution of 
renewable sources or labor to the extent that is economically 
feasible.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Air.</STRONG> Many agricultural activities affect air quality.  These 
include smoke from agricultural burning; dust from tillage, traffic 
and harvest; pesticide drift from spraying; and nitrous oxide 
emissions from the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Options to improve 
air quality include incorporating crop residue into the soil, using 
appropriate levels of tillage, and planting wind breaks, cover 
crops or strips of native perennial grasses to reduce dust.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Soil.</STRONG> Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to our 
continued ability to produce adequate food. Numerous practices have 
been developed to keep soil in place, which include reducing or 
eliminating tillage, managing irrigation to reduce runoff, and 
keeping the soil covered with plants or mulch. Enhancement of soil 
quality is discussed in the next section. <P> 
 
<A NAME="PlantPractices"><H2>Plant Production Practices</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
Sustainable production practices involve a variety of approaches. 
Specific strategies must take into account topography, soil 
characteristics, climate, pests, local availability of inputs and 
the individual grower's goals. Despite the site-specific and 
individual nature of sustainable agriculture, several general 
principles can be applied to help growers select appropriate 
management practices: 
 
<UL> 
	<LI>Selection of species and varieties that are well suited to the site 
and to conditions on the farm; 
	<LI>Diversification of crops (including livestock) and cultural 
practices to enhance the biological and economic stability of the farm; 
	<LI>Management of the soil to enhance and protect soil quality; 
	<LI>Efficient and humane use of inputs; and 
	<LI>Consideration of farmers' goals and lifestyle choices. 
</UL> 
 
<STRONG>Selection of site, species and variety.</STRONG> Preventive strategies, 
adopted early, can reduce inputs and help establish a sustainable 
production system. When possible, pest-resistant crops should be 
selected which are tolerant of existing soil or site conditions. 
When site selection is an option, factors such as soil type and 
depth, previous crop history, and location (e.g. climate, 
topography) should be taken into account before planting.<P> 
   
<STRONG>Diversity.</STRONG> Diversified farms are usually more economically and 
ecologically resilient. While monoculture farming has advantages in 
terms of efficiency and ease of management, the loss of the crop in 
any one year could put a farm out of business and/or seriously 
disrupt the stability of a community dependent on that crop. By 
growing a variety of crops, farmers spread economic risk and are 
less susceptible to the radical price fluctuations associated with 
changes in supply and demand.  <P> 


 
<IMG SRC="/Images/random/close_up.jpg" ALT="Image: Vetch"  WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=186 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT>




Properly managed, diversity can also buffer a farm in a biological 
sense. For example, in annual cropping systems, crop rotation can 
be used to suppress weeds, pathogens and insect pests. Also, cover 
crops can have stabilizing effects on the agroecosystem by holding 
soil and nutrients in place, conserving soil moisture with mowed or 
standing dead mulches, and by increasing the water infiltration 
rate and soil water holding capacity. Cover crops in orchards and 
vineyards can buffer the system against pest infestations by 
increasing beneficial arthropod populations and can therefore 
reduce the need for chemical inputs. Using a variety of cover crops 
is also important in order to protect against the failure of a 
particular species to grow and to attract and sustain a wide range 
of beneficial arthropods.<P> 
 
Optimum diversity may be obtained by integrating both crops and 
livestock in the same farming operation. This was the common 
practice for centuries until the mid-1900s when technology, 
government policy and economics compelled farms to become more 
specialized. Mixed crop and livestock operations have several 
advantages. First, growing row crops only on more level land and 
pasture or forages on steeper slopes will reduce soil erosion. 
Second, pasture and forage crops in rotation enhance soil quality 
and reduce erosion; livestock manure, in turn, contributes to soil 
fertility. Third, livestock can buffer the negative impacts of low 
rainfall periods by consuming crop residue that in "plant only" 
systems would have been considered crop failures. Finally, feeding 
and marketing are flexible in animal production systems. This can 
help cushion farmers against trade and price fluctuations and, in 
conjunction with cropping operations, make more efficient use of 
farm labor. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Soil management.</STRONG>  A common philosophy among sustainable agriculture 
practitioners is that a "healthy" soil is a key component 
of sustainability; that is, a healthy soil will produce healthy 
crop plants that have optimum vigor and are less susceptible to 
pests. While many crops have key pests that attack even the 
healthiest of plants, proper soil, water and nutrient management 
can help prevent some pest problems brought on by crop stress or 
nutrient imbalance. Furthermore, crop management systems that 
impair soil quality often result in greater inputs of water, 
nutrients, pesticides, and/or energy for tillage to maintain 
yields.<P> 
 
In sustainable systems, the soil is viewed as a fragile and living 
medium that must be protected and nurtured to ensure its long-term 
productivity and stability. Methods to protect and enhance the 
productivity of the soil include using cover crops, compost and/or 
manures, reducing tillage, avoiding traffic on wet soils, and 
maintaining soil cover with plants and/or mulches. Conditions in 
most California soils (warm, irrigated, and tilled) do not favor 
the buildup of organic matter. Regular additions of organic matter 
or the use of cover crops can increase soil aggregate stability, 
soil tilth, and diversity of soil microbial life.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Efficient use of inputs.</STRONG> Many inputs and practices used by 
conventional farmers are also used in sustainable agriculture. 
Sustainable farmers, however, maximize reliance on natural, 
renewable, and on-farm inputs. Equally important are the 
environmental, social, and economic impacts of a particular 
strategy. Converting to sustainable practices does not mean simple 
input substitution. Frequently, it substitutes enhanced management 
and scientific knowledge for conventional inputs, especially 
chemical inputs that harm the environment on farms and in rural 
communities. The goal is to develop efficient, biological systems 
which do not need high levels of material inputs.<P> 
 
Growers frequently ask if synthetic chemicals are appropriate in a 
sustainable farming system. Sustainable approaches are those that 
are the least toxic and least energy intensive, and yet maintain 
productivity and profitability. Preventive strategies and other 
alternatives should be employed before using chemical inputs from 
any source. However, there may be situations where the use of 
synthetic chemicals would be more "sustainable" than a strictly 
nonchemical approach or an approach using toxic "organic" 
chemicals. For example, one grape grower switched from tillage to 
a few applications of a broad spectrum contact herbicide in the 
vine row.  This approach may use less energy and may compact the 
soil less than numerous passes with a cultivator or mower.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consideration of farmer goals and lifestyle choices.</STRONG>  Management 
decisions should reflect not only environmental and broad social 
considerations, but also individual goals and lifestyle choices. 
For example, adoption of some technologies or practices that 
promise profitability may also require such intensive management 
that one's lifestyle actually deteriorates. Management decisions 
that promote sustainability, nourish the environment, the community 
<EM>and</EM> the individual.<P> 
 
<A NAME="AnimalPractices"><H2>Animal Production Practices</H2></A> 
 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
In the early part of this century, most farms integrated both crop 
and livestock operations. Indeed, the two were highly complementary 
both biologically and economically. The current picture has changed 
quite drastically since then. Crop and animal producers now are 
still dependent on one another to some degree, but the integration 
now most commonly takes place at a higher level--<EM>between</EM> farmers, 
through intermediaries, rather than <EM>within</EM> the farm itself. This is 
the result of a trend toward separation and specialization of crop 
and animal production systems. Despite this trend, there are still 
many farmers, particularly in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. 
that integrate crop and animal systems--either on dairy farms, or 
with range cattle, sheep or hog operations.<P> 
 
Even with the growing specialization of livestock and crop 
producers, many of the principles outlined in the crop production 
section apply to both groups. The actual management practices will, 
of course, be quite different.  Some of the specific points that 
livestock producers need to address are listed below.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Management Planning.</STRONG> Including livestock in the farming system 
increases the complexity of biological and economic relationships. 
The mobility of the stock, daily feeding, health concerns, breeding 
operations, seasonal feed and forage sources, and complex marketing 
are sources of this complexity. Therefore, a successful ranch plan 
should include enterprise calendars of operations, stock flows, 
forage flows, labor needs, herd production records and land use 
plans to give the manager control and a means of monitoring 
progress toward goals.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Animal Selection.</STRONG> The animal enterprise must be appropriate for the 
farm or ranch resources. Farm capabilities and constraints such as 
feed and forage sources, landscape, climate and skill of the 
manager must be considered in selecting which animals to produce. 
For example, ruminant animals can be raised on a variety of feed 
sources including range and pasture, cultivated forage, cover 
crops, shrubs, weeds, and crop residues. There is a wide range of 
breeds available in each of the major ruminant species, i.e., 
cattle, sheep and goats.  Hardier breeds that, in general, have 
lower growth and milk production potential, are better adapted to 
less favorable environments with sparse or highly seasonal forage 
growth. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Animal nutrition.</STRONG> Feed costs are the largest single variable cost 
in any livestock operation. While most of the feed may come from 
other enterprises on the ranch, some purchased feed is usually 
imported from off the farm. Feed costs can be kept to a minimum by 
monitoring animal condition and performance and understanding 
seasonal variations in feed and forage quality on the farm. 
Determining the optimal use of farm-generated by-products is an 
important challenge of diversified farming.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Reproduction.</STRONG> Use of quality germplasm to improve herd performance 
is another key to sustainability. In combination with good genetic 
stock, adapting the reproduction season to fit the climate and 
sources of feed and forage reduce health problems and feed costs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Herd Health.</STRONG> Animal health greatly influences reproductive success 
and weight gains, two key aspects of successful livestock 
production. Unhealthy stock waste feed and require additional 
labor. A herd health program is critical to sustainable livestock 
production.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Grazing Management.</STRONG> Most adverse environmental impacts associated 
with grazing can be prevented or mitigated with proper grazing 
management. First, the number of stock per unit area (stocking 
rate) must be correct for the landscape and the forage sources.   
There will need to be compromises between the convenience of 
tilling large, unfenced fields and the fencing needs of livestock 
operations. Use of modern, temporary fencing may provide one 
practical solution to this dilemma.  Second, the long term carrying 
capacity and the stocking rate must take into account short and 
long-term droughts.  Especially in Mediterranean climates such as 
in California, properly managed grazing significantly reduces fire 
hazards by reducing fuel build-up in grasslands and brushlands. 
Finally, the manager must achieve sufficient control to reduce 
overuse in some areas while other areas go unused. Prolonged 
concentration of stock that results in permanent loss of vegetative 
cover on uplands or in riparian zones should be avoided. However, 
small scale loss of vegetative cover around water or feed troughs 
may be tolerated if surrounding vegetative cover is adequate.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Confined Livestock Production.</STRONG> Animal health and waste management 
are key issues in confined livestock operations. The moral and 
ethical debate taking place today regarding animal welfare is 
particularly intense for confined livestock production systems. The 
issues raised in this debate need to be addressed.<P> 
  
Confinement livestock production is increasingly a source of 
surface and ground water pollutants, particularly where there are 
large numbers of animals per unit area. Expensive waste management 
facilities are now a necessary cost of confined production systems.  
Waste is a problem of almost all operations and must be managed 
with respect to both the environment and the quality of life in 
nearby communities. Livestock production systems that disperse 
stock in pastures so the wastes are not concentrated and do not 
overwhelm natural nutrient cycling processes have become a subject

In addition to strategies for preserving natural resources and 
changing production practices, sustainable agriculture requires a 
commitment to changing public policies, economic institutions, and 
social values. Strategies for change must take into account the 
complex, reciprocal and ever-changing relationship between 
agricultural production and the broader society.<P> 
 
The "food system" extends far beyond the farm and involves the 
interaction of individuals and institutions with contrasting and 
often competing goals including farmers, researchers, input 
suppliers, farmworkers, unions, farm advisors, processors, 
retailers, consumers, and policymakers. Relationships among these 
actors shift over time as new technologies spawn economic, social 
and political changes.<P> 
 
A wide diversity of strategies and approaches are necessary to 
create a more sustainable food system. These will range from 
specific and concentrated efforts to alter specific policies or 
practices, to the longer-term tasks of reforming key institutions, 
rethinking economic priorities, and challenging widely-held social 
values. Areas of concern where change is most needed include the 
following:<P> 
 
<STRONG>Food and agricultural policy.</STRONG> Existing federal, state and local 
government policies often impede the goals of sustainable 
agriculture. New policies are needed to simultaneously promote 
environmental health, economic profitability, and social and 
economic equity. For example, commodity and price support programs 
could be restructured to allow farmers to realize the full benefits 
of the productivity gains made possible through alternative 
practices. Tax and credit policies could be modified to encourage 
a diverse and decentralized system of family farms rather than 
corporate concentration and absentee ownership. Government and land 
grant university research policies could be modified to emphasize 
the development of sustainable alternatives. Marketing orders and 
cosmetic standards could be amended to encourage reduced pesticide 
use. Coalitions must be created to address these policy concerns at 
the local, regional, and national level.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Land use.</STRONG> Conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is a 
particular concern in California, as rapid growth and escalating 
land values threaten farming on prime soils. Existing farmland 
conversion patterns often discourage farmers from adopting 
sustainable practices and a long-term perspective on the value of 
land. At the same time, the close proximity of newly developed 
residential areas to farms is increasing the public demand for 
environmentally safe farming practices. Comprehensive new policies 
to protect prime soils and regulate development are needed, 
particularly in California's Central Valley. By helping farmers to 
adopt practices that reduce chemical use and conserve scarce 
resources, sustainable agriculture research and education can play 
a key role in building public support for agricultural land 
preservation. Educating land use planners and decision-makers about 
sustainable agriculture is an important priority. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Labor.</STRONG> In California, the conditions of agricultural labor are 
generally far below accepted social standards and legal protections 
in other forms of employment. Policies and programs are needed to 
address this problem, working toward socially just and safe 
employment that provides adequate wages, working conditions, health 
benefits, and chances for economic stability. The needs of migrant 
labor for year-around employment and adequate housing are a 
particularly crucial problem needing immediate attention. To be 
more sustainable over the long-term, labor must be acknowledged and 
supported by government policies, recognized as important 
constituents of land grant universities, and carefully considered 
when assessing the impacts of new technologies and practices.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Rural Community Development.</STRONG> Rural communities in California are 
currently characterized by economic and environmental 
deterioration. Many are among the poorest locations in the nation. 
The reasons for the decline are complex, but changes in farm 
structure have played a significant role. Sustainable agriculture 
presents an opportunity to rethink the importance of family farms 
and rural communities. Economic development policies are needed 
that encourage more diversified agricultural production on family 
farms as a foundation for healthy economies in rural communities. 
In combination with other strategies, sustainable agriculture 
practices and policies can help foster community institutions that 
meet employment, educational, health, cultural and spiritual needs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consumers and the Food System.</STRONG>  Consumers can play a critical role in 
creating a sustainable food system. Through their purchases, they 
send strong messages to producers, retailers and others in the 
system about what they think is important. Food cost and 
nutritional quality have always influenced consumer choices. The 
challenge now is to find strategies that broaden consumer 
perspectives, so that environmental quality, resource use, and 
social equity issues are also considered in shopping decisions. At 
the same time, new policies and institutions must be created to 
enable producers using sustainable practices to market their goods 
to a wider public. Coalitions organized around improving the food 
system are one specific method of creating a dialogue among 
consumers, retailers, producers and others. These coalitions or 
other public forums can be important vehicles for clarifying 
issues, suggesting new policies, increasing mutual trust, and 
encouraging a long-term view of food production, distribution and 
consumption.<P>

<FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>griculture has changed dramatically, especially 
since the end of World War II. Food and fiber productivity soared due to new 
technologies, mechanization, increased chemical use, specialization 
and government policies that favored maximizing production. These 
changes allowed fewer farmers with reduced labor demands to produce 
the majority of the food and fiber in the U.S.<P> 
Although these changes have had many positive effects and reduced 
many risks in farming, there have also been significant 
costs.Prominent among these are topsoil depletion, groundwater 
contamination, the decline of family farms, continued neglect of 
the living and working conditions for farm laborers, increasing 
costs of production, and the disintegration of economic and social 
conditions in rural communities.<P> 
 
A growing movement has emerged during the past two decades to 
question the role of the agricultural establishment in promoting 
practices that contribute to these social problems. Today this 
movement for sustainable agriculture is garnering increasing 
support and acceptance within mainstream agriculture. Not only does 
sustainable agriculture address many environmental and social 
concerns, but it offers innovative and economically viable 
opportunities for growers, laborers, consumers, policymakers and 
many others in the entire food system.<P> 
This paper is an effort to identify the ideas, practices and 
policies that constitute our concept of sustainable agriculture. We 
do so for two reasons: 1) to clarify the research agenda and 
priorities of our program, and 2) to suggest to others practical 
steps that may be appropriate for them in moving toward sustainable 
agriculture.Because the concept of sustainable agriculture is still 
evolving, we intend the paper not as a definitive or final 
statement, but as an invitation to continue the dialogue.<P>  
 
<A NAME="Themes"><H2>Concept Themes</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
Sustainable agriculture integrates three main 
goals--environmental health, economic profitability, and social 
and economic equity. A variety of philosophies, policies and 
practices have contributed to these goals. People in many different 
capacities, from farmers to consumers, have shared this vision and 
contributed to it. Despite the diversity of people and 
perspectives, the following themes commonly weave through 
definitions of sustainable agriculture.<P> 
Sustainability rests on the principle that we must meet the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. Therefore, <EM>stewardship of both 
natural and human resources</EM> is of prime importance. Stewardship of 
human resources includes consideration of social responsibilities 
such as working and living conditions of laborers, the needs of 
rural communities, and consumer health and safety both in the 
present and the future. Stewardship of land and natural resources 
involves maintaining or enhancing this vital resource base for the 
long term.<P>  
A <EM>systems perspective</EM> is essential to understanding sustainability. 
The system is envisioned in its broadest sense, from the individual 
farm, to the local ecosystem, <EM>and</EM> to communities affected by this 
farming system both locally and globally. An emphasis on the system 
allows a larger and more thorough view of the consequences of 
farming practices on both human communities and the environment. A 
systems approach gives us the tools to explore the interconnections 
between farming and other aspects of our environment.<P> 
 
A systems approach also implies <EM>interdisciplinary efforts in 
research and education</EM>. This requires not only the input of 
researchers from various disciplines, but also farmers, 
farmworkers, consumers, policymakers and others. <P> 
 
<EM>Making the transition to sustainable agriculture is a process</EM>. For 
farmers, the transition to sustainable agriculture normally 
requires a series of small, realistic steps. Family economics and 
personal goals influence how fast or how far participants can go in 
the transition. It is important to realize that each small decision 
can make a difference and contribute to advancing the entire system 
further on the "sustainable agriculture continuum." The key 
to moving forward is the will to take the next step.<P> 
 
Finally, it is important to point out that <EM>reaching toward the goal 
of sustainable agriculture is the responsibility of all 
participants in the system</EM>, including farmers, laborers, 
policymakers, researchers, retailers, and consumers. Each group has 
its own part to play, its own unique contribution to make to 
strengthen the sustainable agriculture community.<P> 
 
The remainder of this document considers specific strategies for 
realizing these broad themes or goals.  The strategies are grouped 
according to three separate though related areas of concern: 
Farming and Natural Resources, Plant and Animal Production 
Practices, and the Economic, Social and Political Context. They 
represent a range of potential ideas for individuals committed to 
interpreting the vision of sustainable agriculture within their own 
circumstances.<P> 
 
<A NAME="NaturalResources"><H2>Farming and Natural Resources</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
<STRONG>Water.</STRONG> When the production of food and fiber degrades the natural 
resource base, the ability of future generations to produce and 
flourish decreases. The decline of ancient civilizations in 
Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean region, Pre-Columbian southwest U.S. 
and Central America is believed to have been strongly influenced by 
natural resource degradation from non-sustainable farming and 
forestry practices. Water is the principal resource that has helped 
agriculture and society to prosper, and it has been a major 
limiting factor when mismanaged.<P> 
 
<EM>Water supply and use.</EM> In California, an extensive water storage and 
transfer system has been established which has allowed crop 
production to expand to very arid regions. In drought years, 
limited surface water supplies have prompted overdraft of 
groundwater and consequent intrusion of salt water, or permanent 
collapse of aquifers. Periodic droughts, some lasting up to 50 
years, have occurred in California. Several steps should be taken 
to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in "normal" 
years, including both policy and management actions: 1) improving 
water conservation and storage measures, 2) providing incentives 
for selection of drought-tolerant crop species, 3) using 
reduced-volume irrigation systems, 4) managing crops to reduce 
water loss, or 5) not planting at all.<P> 
 
<EM>Water quality.</EM> The most important issues related to water quality 
involve salinization and contamination of ground and surface waters 
by pesticides, nitrates and selenium. Salinity has become a problem 
wherever water of even relatively low salt content is used on 
shallow soils in arid regions and/or where the water table is near 
the root zone of crops. Tile drainage can remove the water and 
salts, but the disposal of the salts and other contaminants may 
negatively affect the environment depending upon where they are 
deposited. Temporary solutions include the use of salt-tolerant 
crops, low-volume irrigation, and various management techniques to 
minimize the effects of salts on crops. In the long-term, some 
farmland may need to be removed from production or converted to 
other uses. Other uses include conversion of row crop land to 
production of drought-tolerant forages, the restoration of wildlife 
habitat or the use of agroforestry to minimize the impacts of 
salinity and high water tables. Pesticide and nitrate contamination 
of water can be reduced using many of the practices discussed later 
in the <A HREF="#PlantPractices">Plant Production 
Practices</A> and <A HREF="#AnimalPractices">Animal Production 
Practices</A> sections.<P> 
 <IMG SRC="/Images/random/owl.jpg" ALT="Image: Owl"  WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=213 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=LEFT>

<EM>Wildlife.</EM> Another way in which agriculture affects water resources 
is through the destruction of riparian habitats within watersheds. 
The conversion of wild habitat to agricultural land reduces fish 
and wildlife through erosion and sedimentation, the effects of 
pesticides, removal of riparian plants, and the diversion of water. 
The plant diversity in and around both riparian and agricultural 
areas should be maintained in order to support a diversity of 
wildlife. This diversity will enhance natural ecosystems and could 
aid in agricultural pest management.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Energy.</STRONG> Modern agriculture is heavily dependent on non-renewable 
energy sources, especially petroleum. The continued use of these 
energy sources cannot be sustained indefinitely, yet to abruptly 
abandon our reliance on them would be economically catastrophic. 
However, a sudden cutoff in energy supply would be equally 
disruptive. In sustainable agricultural systems, there is reduced 
reliance on non-renewable energy sources and a substitution of 
renewable sources or labor to the extent that is economically 
feasible.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Air.</STRONG> Many agricultural activities affect air quality.  These 
include smoke from agricultural burning; dust from tillage, traffic 
and harvest; pesticide drift from spraying; and nitrous oxide 
emissions from the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Options to improve 
air quality include incorporating crop residue into the soil, using 
appropriate levels of tillage, and planting wind breaks, cover 
crops or strips of native perennial grasses to reduce dust.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Soil.</STRONG> Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to our 
continued ability to produce adequate food. Numerous practices have 
been developed to keep soil in place, which include reducing or 
eliminating tillage, managing irrigation to reduce runoff, and 
keeping the soil covered with plants or mulch. Enhancement of soil 
quality is discussed in the next section. <P> 
 
<A NAME="PlantPractices"><H2>Plant Production Practices</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
Sustainable production practices involve a variety of approaches. 
Specific strategies must take into account topography, soil 
characteristics, climate, pests, local availability of inputs and 
the individual grower's goals. Despite the site-specific and 
individual nature of sustainable agriculture, several general 
principles can be applied to help growers select appropriate 
management practices: 
 
<UL> 
	<LI>Selection of species and varieties that are well suited to the site 
and to conditions on the farm; 
	<LI>Diversification of crops (including livestock) and cultural 
practices to enhance the biological and economic stability of the farm; 
	<LI>Management of the soil to enhance and protect soil quality; 
	<LI>Efficient and humane use of inputs; and 
	<LI>Consideration of farmers' goals and lifestyle choices. 
</UL> 
 
<STRONG>Selection of site, species and variety.</STRONG> Preventive strategies, 
adopted early, can reduce inputs and help establish a sustainable 
production system. When possible, pest-resistant crops should be 
selected which are tolerant of existing soil or site conditions. 
When site selection is an option, factors such as soil type and 
depth, previous crop history, and location (e.g. climate, 
topography) should be taken into account before planting.<P> 
   
<STRONG>Diversity.</STRONG> Diversified farms are usually more economically and 
ecologically resilient. While monoculture farming has advantages in 
terms of efficiency and ease of management, the loss of the crop in 
any one year could put a farm out of business and/or seriously 
disrupt the stability of a community dependent on that crop. By 
growing a variety of crops, farmers spread economic risk and are 
less susceptible to the radical price fluctuations associated with 
changes in supply and demand.  <P> 


 
<IMG SRC="/Images/random/close_up.jpg" ALT="Image: Vetch"  WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=186 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT>




Properly managed, diversity can also buffer a farm in a biological 
sense. For example, in annual cropping systems, crop rotation can 
be used to suppress weeds, pathogens and insect pests. Also, cover 
crops can have stabilizing effects on the agroecosystem by holding 
soil and nutrients in place, conserving soil moisture with mowed or 
standing dead mulches, and by increasing the water infiltration 
rate and soil water holding capacity. Cover crops in orchards and 
vineyards can buffer the system against pest infestations by 
increasing beneficial arthropod populations and can therefore 
reduce the need for chemical inputs. Using a variety of cover crops 
is also important in order to protect against the failure of a 
particular species to grow and to attract and sustain a wide range 
of beneficial arthropods.<P> 
 
Optimum diversity may be obtained by integrating both crops and 
livestock in the same farming operation. This was the common 
practice for centuries until the mid-1900s when technology, 
government policy and economics compelled farms to become more 
specialized. Mixed crop and livestock operations have several 
advantages. First, growing row crops only on more level land and 
pasture or forages on steeper slopes will reduce soil erosion. 
Second, pasture and forage crops in rotation enhance soil quality 
and reduce erosion; livestock manure, in turn, contributes to soil 
fertility. Third, livestock can buffer the negative impacts of low 
rainfall periods by consuming crop residue that in "plant only" 
systems would have been considered crop failures. Finally, feeding 
and marketing are flexible in animal production systems. This can 
help cushion farmers against trade and price fluctuations and, in 
conjunction with cropping operations, make more efficient use of 
farm labor. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Soil management.</STRONG>  A common philosophy among sustainable agriculture 
practitioners is that a "healthy" soil is a key component 
of sustainability; that is, a healthy soil will produce healthy 
crop plants that have optimum vigor and are less susceptible to 
pests. While many crops have key pests that attack even the 
healthiest of plants, proper soil, water and nutrient management 
can help prevent some pest problems brought on by crop stress or 
nutrient imbalance. Furthermore, crop management systems that 
impair soil quality often result in greater inputs of water, 
nutrients, pesticides, and/or energy for tillage to maintain 
yields.<P> 
 
In sustainable systems, the soil is viewed as a fragile and living 
medium that must be protected and nurtured to ensure its long-term 
productivity and stability. Methods to protect and enhance the 
productivity of the soil include using cover crops, compost and/or 
manures, reducing tillage, avoiding traffic on wet soils, and 
maintaining soil cover with plants and/or mulches. Conditions in 
most California soils (warm, irrigated, and tilled) do not favor 
the buildup of organic matter. Regular additions of organic matter 
or the use of cover crops can increase soil aggregate stability, 
soil tilth, and diversity of soil microbial life.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Efficient use of inputs.</STRONG> Many inputs and practices used by 
conventional farmers are also used in sustainable agriculture. 
Sustainable farmers, however, maximize reliance on natural, 
renewable, and on-farm inputs. Equally important are the 
environmental, social, and economic impacts of a particular 
strategy. Converting to sustainable practices does not mean simple 
input substitution. Frequently, it substitutes enhanced management 
and scientific knowledge for conventional inputs, especially 
chemical inputs that harm the environment on farms and in rural 
communities. The goal is to develop efficient, biological systems 
which do not need high levels of material inputs.<P> 
 
Growers frequently ask if synthetic chemicals are appropriate in a 
sustainable farming system. Sustainable approaches are those that 
are the least toxic and least energy intensive, and yet maintain 
productivity and profitability. Preventive strategies and other 
alternatives should be employed before using chemical inputs from 
any source. However, there may be situations where the use of 
synthetic chemicals would be more "sustainable" than a strictly 
nonchemical approach or an approach using toxic "organic" 
chemicals. For example, one grape grower switched from tillage to 
a few applications of a broad spectrum contact herbicide in the 
vine row.  This approach may use less energy and may compact the 
soil less than numerous passes with a cultivator or mower.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consideration of farmer goals and lifestyle choices.</STRONG>  Management 
decisions should reflect not only environmental and broad social 
considerations, but also individual goals and lifestyle choices. 
For example, adoption of some technologies or practices that 
promise profitability may also require such intensive management 
that one's lifestyle actually deteriorates. Management decisions 
that promote sustainability, nourish the environment, the community 
<EM>and</EM> the individual.<P> 
 
<A NAME="AnimalPractices"><H2>Animal Production Practices</H2></A> 
 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
In the early part of this century, most farms integrated both crop 
and livestock operations. Indeed, the two were highly complementary 
both biologically and economically. The current picture has changed 
quite drastically since then. Crop and animal producers now are 
still dependent on one another to some degree, but the integration 
now most commonly takes place at a higher level--<EM>between</EM> farmers, 
through intermediaries, rather than <EM>within</EM> the farm itself. This is 
the result of a trend toward separation and specialization of crop 
and animal production systems. Despite this trend, there are still 
many farmers, particularly in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. 
that integrate crop and animal systems--either on dairy farms, or 
with range cattle, sheep or hog operations.<P> 
 
Even with the growing specialization of livestock and crop 
producers, many of the principles outlined in the crop production 
section apply to both groups. The actual management practices will, 
of course, be quite different.  Some of the specific points that 
livestock producers need to address are listed below.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Management Planning.</STRONG> Including livestock in the farming system 
increases the complexity of biological and economic relationships. 
The mobility of the stock, daily feeding, health concerns, breeding 
operations, seasonal feed and forage sources, and complex marketing 
are sources of this complexity. Therefore, a successful ranch plan 
should include enterprise calendars of operations, stock flows, 
forage flows, labor needs, herd production records and land use 
plans to give the manager control and a means of monitoring 
progress toward goals.<P> 
  
<STRONG>Animal Selection.</STRONG> The animal enterprise must be appropriate for the 
farm or ranch resources. Farm capabilities and constraints such as 
feed and forage sources, landscape, climate and skill of the 
manager must be considered in selecting which animals to produce. 
For example, ruminant animals can be raised on a variety of feed 
sources including range and pasture, cultivated forage, cover 
crops, shrubs, weeds, and crop residues. There is a wide range of 
breeds available in each of the major ruminant species, i.e., 
cattle, sheep and goats.  Hardier breeds that, in general, have 
lower growth and milk production potential, are better adapted to 
less favorable environments with sparse or highly seasonal forage 
growth. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Animal nutrition.</STRONG> Feed costs are the largest single variable cost 
in any livestock operation. While most of the feed may come from 
other enterprises on the ranch, some purchased feed is usually 
imported from off the farm. Feed costs can be kept to a minimum by 
monitoring animal condition and performance and understanding 
seasonal variations in feed and forage quality on the farm. 
Determining the optimal use of farm-generated by-products is an 
important challenge of diversified farming.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Reproduction.</STRONG> Use of quality germplasm to improve herd performance 
is another key to sustainability. In combination with good genetic 
stock, adapting the reproduction season to fit the climate and 
sources of feed and forage reduce health problems and feed costs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Herd Health.</STRONG> Animal health greatly influences reproductive success 
and weight gains, two key aspects of successful livestock 
production. Unhealthy stock waste feed and require additional 
labor. A herd health program is critical to sustainable livestock 
production.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Grazing Management.</STRONG> Most adverse environmental impacts associated 
with grazing can be prevented or mitigated with proper grazing 
management. First, the number of stock per unit area (stocking 
rate) must be correct for the landscape and the forage sources.   
There will need to be compromises between the convenience of 
tilling large, unfenced fields and the fencing needs of livestock 
operations. Use of modern, temporary fencing may provide one 
practical solution to this dilemma.  Second, the long term carrying 
capacity and the stocking rate must take into account short and 
long-term droughts.  Especially in Mediterranean climates such as 
in California, properly managed grazing significantly reduces fire 
hazards by reducing fuel build-up in grasslands and brushlands. 
Finally, the manager must achieve sufficient control to reduce 
overuse in some areas while other areas go unused. Prolonged 
concentration of stock that results in permanent loss of vegetative 
cover on uplands or in riparian zones should be avoided. However, 
small scale loss of vegetative cover around water or feed troughs 
may be tolerated if surrounding vegetative cover is adequate.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Confined Livestock Production.</STRONG> Animal health and waste management 
are key issues in confined livestock operations. The moral and 
ethical debate taking place today regarding animal welfare is 
particularly intense for confined livestock production systems. The 
issues raised in this debate need to be addressed.<P> 
  
Confinement livestock production is increasingly a source of 
surface and ground water pollutants, particularly where there are 
large numbers of animals per unit area. Expensive waste management 
facilities are now a necessary cost of confined production systems.  
Waste is a problem of almost all operations and must be managed 
with respect to both the environment and the quality of life in 
nearby communities. Livestock production systems that disperse 
stock in pastures so the wastes are not concentrated and do not 
overwhelm natural nutrient cycling processes have become a subject 
of renewed interest.<P> 
  
<A NAME="Context"><H2>The Economic, Social & Political Context</H2></A> 
<A HREF="#Top"><EM>Back to Top</EM></A><P> 
 
In addition to strategies for preserving natural resources and 
changing production practices, sustainable agriculture requires a 
commitment to changing public policies, economic institutions, and 
social values. Strategies for change must take into account the 
complex, reciprocal and ever-changing relationship between 
agricultural production and the broader society.<P> 
 
The "food system" extends far beyond the farm and involves the 
interaction of individuals and institutions with contrasting and 
often competing goals including farmers, researchers, input 
suppliers, farmworkers, unions, farm advisors, processors, 
retailers, consumers, and policymakers. Relationships among these 
actors shift over time as new technologies spawn economic, social 
and political changes.<P> 
 
A wide diversity of strategies and approaches are necessary to 
create a more sustainable food system. These will range from 
specific and concentrated efforts to alter specific policies or 
practices, to the longer-term tasks of reforming key institutions, 
rethinking economic priorities, and challenging widely-held social 
values. Areas of concern where change is most needed include the 
following:<P> 
 
<STRONG>Food and agricultural policy.</STRONG> Existing federal, state and local 
government policies often impede the goals of sustainable 
agriculture. New policies are needed to simultaneously promote 
environmental health, economic profitability, and social and 
economic equity. For example, commodity and price support programs 
could be restructured to allow farmers to realize the full benefits 
of the productivity gains made possible through alternative 
practices. Tax and credit policies could be modified to encourage 
a diverse and decentralized system of family farms rather than 
corporate concentration and absentee ownership. Government and land 
grant university research policies could be modified to emphasize 
the development of sustainable alternatives. Marketing orders and 
cosmetic standards could be amended to encourage reduced pesticide 
use. Coalitions must be created to address these policy concerns at 
the local, regional, and national level.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Land use.</STRONG> Conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is a 
particular concern in California, as rapid growth and escalating 
land values threaten farming on prime soils. Existing farmland 
conversion patterns often discourage farmers from adopting 
sustainable practices and a long-term perspective on the value of 
land. At the same time, the close proximity of newly developed 
residential areas to farms is increasing the public demand for 
environmentally safe farming practices. Comprehensive new policies 
to protect prime soils and regulate development are needed, 
particularly in California's Central Valley. By helping farmers to 
adopt practices that reduce chemical use and conserve scarce 
resources, sustainable agriculture research and education can play 
a key role in building public support for agricultural land 
preservation. Educating land use planners and decision-makers about 
sustainable agriculture is an important priority. <P> 
 
<STRONG>Labor.</STRONG> In California, the conditions of agricultural labor are 
generally far below accepted social standards and legal protections 
in other forms of employment. Policies and programs are needed to 
address this problem, working toward socially just and safe 
employment that provides adequate wages, working conditions, health 
benefits, and chances for economic stability. The needs of migrant 
labor for year-around employment and adequate housing are a 
particularly crucial problem needing immediate attention. To be 
more sustainable over the long-term, labor must be acknowledged and 
supported by government policies, recognized as important 
constituents of land grant universities, and carefully considered 
when assessing the impacts of new technologies and practices.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Rural Community Development.</STRONG> Rural communities in California are 
currently characterized by economic and environmental 
deterioration. Many are among the poorest locations in the nation. 
The reasons for the decline are complex, but changes in farm 
structure have played a significant role. Sustainable agriculture 
presents an opportunity to rethink the importance of family farms 
and rural communities. Economic development policies are needed 
that encourage more diversified agricultural production on family 
farms as a foundation for healthy economies in rural communities. 
In combination with other strategies, sustainable agriculture 
practices and policies can help foster community institutions that 
meet employment, educational, health, cultural and spiritual needs.<P> 
 
<STRONG>Consumers and the Food System.</STRONG>  Consumers can play a critical role in 
creating a sustainable food system. Through their purchases, they 
send strong messages to producers, retailers and others in the 
system about what they think is important. Food cost and 
nutritional quality have always influenced consumer choices. The 
challenge now is to find strategies that broaden consumer 
perspectives, so that environmental quality, resource use, and 
social equity issues are also considered in shopping decisions. At 
the same time, new policies and institutions must be created to 
enable producers using sustainable practices to market their goods 
to a wider public. Coalitions organized around improving the food 
system are one specific method of creating a dialogue among 
consumers, retailers, producers and others. These coalitions or 
other public forums can be important vehicles for clarifying 
issues, suggesting new policies, increasing mutual trust, and 
encouraging a long-term view of food production, distribution and 
consumption.<P>

<h3 align=center><a name="OVERVIEW"><b>OVERVIEW </b></a><b>FOR ORGANIC COTTON PRODUCTION<br>
</b></h3>
<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>The California cotton production industry ranks second in cotton production in the nation with over one million acres of irrigated 
cropland. This comprises about 15% of the United States cotton production, and about 4% of the global total. Cotton is the fifth 
largest contributor to total farm income in the state, and regularly has a gross value of approximately $1 billion in seed and lint. The 
vast majority of California's cotton is produced in the San Joaquin Valley, with lesser acreages found in the Imperial, Palo Verde and 
Sacramento Valleys.</p>
<p>In recent years California's organic agricultural industry has expanded considerably. The production of organic cotton has likewise 
increased. Several San Joaquin Valley growers now devote a portion of their acreage to the production of organic cotton, with a 
substantial number of those acres located in the Northern San Joaquin Valley. San Joaquin Valley farms producing organic cotton are 
typically large, with farm size reaching up to 2,500 acres. Growers either commit all, or only a portion, of their farm acreage to 
organic production. Crops are also rotated on the organic acreage, making the number of acres planted to organic cotton smaller 
than the total, usually ranging from 10 to 800 acres each year. Crops rotated with organic cotton include alfalfa, dried beans, 
leguminous green manure crops (bell beans, peas, and vetch), processing tomatoes, oats and wheat.</p>
<p>This overview is meant to familiarize the reader with grower practices and critical issues facing producers of organic cotton today. 
The first section details the seasonal flow of operations for the production and ginning (processing) of organic cotton. The subsequent 
sections discuss crop rotation and diversification, cover crops and pest management. Following these discussions, grower risk and 
marketing for organically produced cotton are addressed. The current status of regulations governing organic commodities is 
encapsulated in the final section.</p>
<p><b><u>Production and Ginning Practices</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Many of the production practices for organically grown cotton are similar to that of a conventionally grown crop. Cultural operations 
begin with land preparation in either the fall or winter depending on the rotation and/or preceding crop. Bed preparation, planting and 
all subsequent operations take place during the spring and summer months until harvest in October or November. At harvest, cotton 
is referred to as seed cotton. Ginning takes place after harvest and is usually completed by February. The ginning process yields two 
products: cotton lint and cottonseed. Cultural operations are often delayed in years with cool, wet springs. When this occurs, ginning 
may not be completed until March.</p>
<p><b>Land Preparation. </b>Production practices typically begin by working the ground with a subsoiler, followed by two discings. After 
these initial tillage operations, a composted poultry manure is often spread and incorporated into the soil by two additional discings. 
This fertilizing material provides organic matter as well as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients at varying levels 
depending on the material's composition. The volume of compost that is spread and the number of passes for each operation varies 
and is dependent on soil fertility, surface residue and soil tilth.</p>
<p>No other fertilizing materials are commonly applied prior to planting the crop. However, some fields may require additional or 
alternative fertilizing material applications. Only those materials considered organically acceptable by certification agencies and/or 
state and federal law may be used. Materials are generally applied if soil analyses indicate a need. In addition, grower experience, 
cropping sequence and cost will help determine the appropriate fertility program. Other soil fertility management techniques include 
crop rotation, and to a lesser extent, cover cropping. </p>
<p>After the initial land preparation, fields are preirrigated once in February or March depending on seasonal rains and water availability. 
In April, beds are listed and then worked with a rolling cultivator to remove weeds and prepare for planting.</p>
<p><b>Planting. </b>Cotton is direct seeded in April on single row 38-inch beds (furrow to furrow). An approved Acala variety is planted. For 
organic production, California state law and certification agency regulations stipulate the use of seed that has not been fungicide 
treated, unless untreated seed is unavailable. Organic cotton is often planted less densely than conventionally grown cotton to 
minimize competition for sunlight, water and nutrients, and encourage large boll development. Fields that are less densely planted also 
require fewer beneficial insects to assist in pest management. </p>
<p><b>Pest Management. </b>Pest management techniques for the control of diseases, insects, mites and weeds begin after planting and 
continue throughout the summer. Pest pressure varies depending on the farm location, climatic conditions, the previous year's pest 
incidence, and neighboring crops and habitat. Refer to the <b>Pest Management </b>section for further information</p>
<p><b>Irrigation Management</b>. Crop irrigations are usually performed from May through August. The delivery method, number of 
applications, and the amount of applied surface water varies from location to location. Total applied water depends on the soil type, 
residual soil moisture and water availability. Furrow irrigation is the preferred application method for cotton. Water is either pumped 
from underground wells or delivered by an irrigation district and applied to fields using ditches and siphon tubes or gated pipe. Gated 
poly or aluminum pipe is used to improve irrigation efficiency by minimizing evaporative water loss and reducing labor costs.</p>
<p>Proper irrigation management is essential for cotton, and is used to balance vegetative growth with boll development, as well as to 
manage disease and insect populations. Frequent, excessive irrigations promote &quot;rank&quot; cotton, that is, plants that favor vegetative 
growth over boll development. Not only is yield sacrificed in the long-run by too much water, but insect pests such as aphids and 
lygus bugs are more attracted to the lush vegetative growth that results. In contrast, too little water stresses cotton and also results in 
reduced boll development. For organic cotton, water management is commonly used as a defoliant tool: by curtailing the supply of 
water earlier in the season than for conventionally grown cotton, defoliation is enhanced. </p>
<p><b>Boll Maturation and Defoliation. </b>Prior to harvesting a conventionally grown cotton crop, synthetic growth regulators and 
defoliants are applied to fields to stimulate uniform boll maturation and leaf drop, respectively. These practices are used to increase 
the efficiency of mechanical harvesting and ginning. Specifically, plant leaves (trash) clog mechanical pickers, slow harvest, and stain 
cotton lint. Gin costs increase with increased trash levels because a greater amount of seed cotton is required to make a bale of 
cotton lint. In addition, stained lint reduces the grade of cotton.</p>
<p>According to California State law, the growth regulators and defoliants used by conventional growers are not allowed for use by 
growers of organic cotton. Instead, organic cotton growers rely on nutrient and water management to assist in boll maturation, 
opening and plant defoliation. For example, growers supply only enough nitrogen to insure fruit set and boll development on a yearly 
basis. Overfertilization or excessive soil nitrogen promotes vegetative growth and discourages boll maturation, resulting in reduced 
yields. Petiole analysis is sometimes used to determine the level of plant nitrogen, and to manage growth. Also, zinc sulfate is 
foliar-applied to assist in boll maturation and opening. A soil or plant deficiency in either zinc or sulfur must be demonstrated before 
this material can be applied. As mentioned above, water is cut off early in the season in an attempt to stress plants and aid in 
defoliation. </p>
<p>While these techniques help with respect to boll maturation and plant defoliation, they do not always achieve the same results as the 
synthetically formulated materials used by conventional growers. In cases where a low level of defoliation is attained, harvests may be 
slowed and cotton grades reduced, with trash levels and ginning costs increased. Defoliation presents one of the greatest challenges 
for the production of organic cotton. A number of different techniques that meet federal, state and certification agency standards are 
currently being tested for their value in assisting the defoliation process, including the use of various organically acceptable foliar 
sprays. However, at present none have been found to be as effective for defoliating organic cotton as the materials available to 
conventional growers.</p>
<p><b>Harvest and Ginning. </b>Organic cotton is mechanically harvested with spindle-type pickers by the grower, a custom operator, or a 
combination of the two. Harvest is performed in October or November depending on the seasonal conditions. Harvested seed 
cotton is unloaded into a module builder near the field, where it is compressed and then transported to the cotton gin for processing.</p>
<p>It is best if the crop is harvested with a low moisture content so that, if necessary, the cotton can be stored for a period of time prior 
to ginning without reducing quality or grade. To achieve this, harvest of organic cotton often begins later and is finished earlier in the 
day than is typical for conventionally grown cotton. Low moisture content (12% or less), and the potential for storage, is particularly 
important because state law and certification agency regulations require organic and conventional cotton to remain separated at the 
gin if the product is to be sold on the organic market. Gins must shut down and clean out their machinery prior to processing organic 
cotton in order to meet these regulations. Consequently, a gin may not be immediately available to accept and gin the organic seed 
cotton, resulting in the need for storage. Cotton that is harvested at a relatively high moisture content, and not ginned promptly, may 
have lower grades due to lint staining caused by leaf trash. In addition, decomposition of seed cotton can occur. </p>
<p>Yields for organically produced cotton in the Northern San Joaquin Valley range from 1.3 to 2.0 (500 pound) bales per acre for 
cotton lint, and 1,100 to 1,500 pounds per acre of cottonseed. This yield range is somewhat lower than the five year range average 
for conventionally grown cotton in the San Joaquin Valley. Yields are influenced by many factors including production location, 
weather conditions, soil fertility, pest control, irrigation and grower management. </p>
<p><b><u>Crop Rotation and Diversification</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Crop rotation and diversification are important elements of organic row and field crop operations. Diversification can enhance 
economic stability by allowing production risks to be spread over a greater number of crops. Ideally, the crop mix should be 
complementary; that is, all practices should be performed in a timely manner without competition for labor, equipment, and 
management expertise. In reality, this may not always be possible because of factors beyond a grower's control, such as unusual 
weather conditions, pest infestations, or peak work periods. Diversification may also mean that a grower will need additional 
resources such as specialized farm machinery.</p>
<p>Rotations are characterized by cropping sequences that alternate a variety of crops and may include a cover or green manure crop. 
A crop rotation's purpose is to recycle nutrients, break pest cycles, and/or maintain a balance between soil organic matter 
accumulation and decomposition. Organic matter is particularly important for improving soil structure and for providing nitrogen and 
other nutrients for crop production. Individual organic farmers have differing strategies for planting and rotating a variety of crops. 
Cropping history and grower experience will factor into the determination of each year's rotation. Other considerations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The requirements of each crop's culture. </li>
<li>The compatibility of each crop in terms of labor, equipment and seasonal timing. </li>
<li>The ability to provide year-round employment for farm workers. </li>
<li>The availability of nutrients. Crops with greater nutrient requirements may produce higher yields when following a cover crop. 
Also, crops with different root growth patterns may be better able to utilize residual nutrients that a previous crop was unable 
to capture. </li>
<li>The existing pest complex including weeds, disease, and arthropods (insects and mites). Selection of a crop that competes 
well with weeds, or planting disease-resistant cultivars may help overcome some of these difficulties. </li>
<li>The crop value and access to markets. </li>
</ol>
<p>Organic cotton growers usually plant cotton once every two to three years on a given field. Since a typical farm consists of multiple 
fields, cotton will be grown somewhere on the farm each season. In addition, because growers use a limited number of crops in their 
rotations, cotton is sometimes grown back-to-back on the same acreage. Other crops used with cotton in rotation include alfalfa, 
dried beans, leguminous green manure crops (bell beans, winter peas, and vetch), processing tomatoes, oats and wheat. </p>
<p><b><u>Cover Crops</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Cover crops can be beneficial for crop production in a number of ways. Water penetration and infiltration can be improved by root 
growth of a cover crop and by returning organic matter to soils. Grasses are particularly helpful in promoting soil structure and soil 
aggregate stability because of their fibrous root systems. Microbial activity, often stimulated by cover crop root exudates and organic 
matter additions to soils, has also been shown to promote aggregate stability. This is important because soil erosion and degradation 
processes are reduced in aggregated soils. In addition, nutrients are released as microbes decompose organic matter. Leguminous 
cover crops can increase soil nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Weed suppression for subsequent crops may be another benefit. 
Furthermore, cover crops increase plant diversity in a farming system and in the flowering stage can provide pollen and nectar to 
attract and sustain beneficial arthropods. Cover crops (and other rotation crops) also act as trap crops, attracting cotton crop pests 
away from cotton. </p>
<p>Planting cover crops may result in some negative impacts. Cover crops can attract some arthropod pests to production areas. Cover 
crops often require additional inputs such as seed, irrigation water and labor. In this area, water use in particular should be taken into 
consideration because it may be in short supply for some farms. Cover crops may also reduce the amount of land to which 
revenue-producing crops are planted unless land would otherwise have been winter-fallowed. However, some organic growers view 
the cost of planting and maintaining a cover crop as the cost of producing nitrogen and/or improving soil quality for the long-term.</p>
<p>Selection of a particular cover crop species should take into account the growing requirements of the cover crop itself as well as the 
previous and subsequent crops, the soil type, and possible irrigation for stand establishment. In this region grasses such as barley and 
wheat, and legumes such as bell beans, winter peas and vetch have been successfully managed and rotated on a small scale with 
cotton in the short winter between production seasons. However, the timing of cover crops and cotton plantings should remain 
flexible in response to winter weather in any given production year.</p>
<p><b><u>Pest Management</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Pest identification, monitoring and prevention are essential elements of successful cotton production. This is especially true for organic 
production because most of the pesticides that are currently used by producers of conventionally grown cotton are not approved for 
use by growers of organic cotton. Moreover, allowed pest control products are generally not as effective as synthetic pesticides for 
immediate or acute problems. Treatments such as biological controls and natural pesticides are used to decrease pest damage and 
reduce short-run economic risks when needed. These treatments, in conjunction with crop rotation, diversification and cultural 
practices may reduce and/or control disease, weed and insect problems. Growers should be certain that any materials used are in 
compliance with the rules and regulations of federal, state and organic certification agencies (refer to the <b>Regulations of 
Organically Grown Commodities</b> section). Application rates vary depending the extensiveness of a pest infestation.</p>
<p><b>Diseases. </b>The incidence of disease in organic cotton fields is similar to that of conventionally farmed acreages. Techniques used to 
minimize disease incidence include 1) avoid planting in cold, wet soils which encourage seedling diseases, 2) improve field drainage 
and/or modify irrigations methods so that saturated soils cannot provide a favorable environment for disease, and 3) crop rotation.</p>
<p><b>Insects and mites. </b>Important arthropod pests found in organic cotton production systems in the Northern San Joaquin Valley 
include lygus bugs (<i>Lygus hesperus)</i>, cotton aphid (<i>Aphis gossypii</i>) and spider mites (<i>Tetranychus</i> spp.). These insects feed on 
plant foliage, squares and small bolls. Economic damage occurs when pest populations are significant enough to weaken and reduce 
plant growth, promote square shedding and reduce overall yields. The aphid exudate honeydew can also contaminate cotton lint, and 
encourage sooty mold growth. Under these conditions, yields are also reduced.</p>
<p>In organic cotton fields, insect and mite pests are primarily managed by monitoring the level of natural predators, parasites and 
parasitoids, and by the release of biological control agents to augment that which already exists in the field. Fields are usually checked 
two to three times weekly. The natural predators, parasites and parasitoids that are found in Northern San Joaquin Valley cotton 
fields include: assassin bugs (Family <i>Reduviidae</i>), bigeyed bugs (<i>Geocoris</i> spp.), minute pirate bugs (<i>Orius</i> spp.) and various spiders 
and parasitic wasps. Green lacewings larvae (<i>Chrysopa </i>spp.) are often released to help reduce populations of lygus bugs, mites and 
other soft-bodied insects such as aphids. In the past predaceous mites and beneficial wasps of the genus <i>Trichogramma</i> have also 
been released to help reduce certain insect and caterpillar populations present in cotton fields.
</p>
<p>When necessary, sulfur dust is applied to fields and/or field edges to control mites. Alfalfa that is planted in neighboring fields also 
acts as a host or trap crop for insect pests, particularly lygus bugs. Native or planted vegetation can also act as beneficial insect 
habitats in which native predators are conserved. These management techniques, in addition to management of water and plant 
density, can successfully keep insect pests at tolerable levels. </p>
<p><b>Weeds. </b>Optimal weed control for organically produced cotton in the San Joaquin Valley results from the integration of mechanical 
cultivations and hand hoeing. Beds are mechanically cultivated prior to planting to remove weeds. After planting, weeds are largely 
managed by tillage with a cultivator that disturbs a weed's root system and prevents regrowth. The total number and exact timing of 
each cultivation is dependent on the crop's planting date, the amount of soil moisture, the crop's stage of growth, and the crop's 
ability to compete effectively with weeds. Hand weeding and chopping are also necessary for weed control in cotton rows. </p>
<p>Growers report greater difficulty in managing weeds in organic cotton acreages than in conventional cotton acreages. Furthermore, 
greater difficulty is encountered in managing perennial weeds over annual weeds within organic cotton systems in general. Perennial 
weeds are sometimes managed in organic fields by rotating land with known problems out of cotton and into a winter wheat (or other 
grain) crop. By spring, the grain crop is established and has the potential to suppress germination of perennial weeds by excluding 
sunlight. Because an overwintered grain crop is not irrigated in the spring, weeds must also complete with the established crop for 
water. In some cases, fields may be fallowed over the winter and cultivated multiple times in the spring and early summer to reduce 
perennial weed growth. In contrast herbicides, mechanical cultivations and hand hoeing are used to control annual and perennial 
weeds in conventional cotton fields. </p>
<p><b><u>Grower Risk and Marketing</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Growers of organically produced cotton currently face three major production and market risks each year. As mentioned above, 
defoliation of organic cotton is one of the major production challenges, or risks. Lack of defoliation can increase production costs, 
decrease yields and reduce overall cotton grade. A second, but equally important production risk is that of securing a production 
loan each year. Securing a yearly production loan is crucial to managing finances and bringing the crop to harvest.</p>
<p>The third major risk is marketing or selling the crop after ginning has been completed. Each gin retains the cottonseed that results 
from the ginning process, in effect purchasing the seed from the grower in &quot;exchange&quot; for the costs incurred to gin the cotton (refer to 
the <b>Cost and Returns</b> portion of this study for additional information). This means that growers are mainly concerned with selling the 
cotton lint. While commodities that are produced organically can often be sold for a premium price, production supply, market 
competition and consumer demand all affect returns to growers. At present the market for organic cotton is volatile, that is, demand 
and price vary significantly from year to year. Sales contracts and price premiums are not guaranteed nor are all bales of lint 
necessarily sold at one set price. Depending on the attained level of defoliation and leaf stain, a portion of the ginned cotton lint may 
be graded a lower quality, and therefore a receive a lower price. In addition, growers are sometimes forced to sell their product on 
the conventional market when a market for organic cotton lint is not available. In total, the risks associated with organic cotton should 
not be minimized; each affects the long-run economic viability of an operation.</p>
<p><b><u>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</u></b><b>: <br>
State Registration. </b>Growers who choose to produce and<b><i> </i></b>market their crops as organic must register on a yearly basis with the 
State of California under the California Organic Foods Act of 1990. Enforced under this act are the provisions of Article 4.5 
(commencing with Section 26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21 of the California Health and Safety Code and of the California 
Food and Agricultural Code commencing with Section 46000. These provisions contain rules and regulations that must be adhered 
to by all producers, processors and handlers of organic commodities. As of January 1, 1996 organic commodities must not be 
produced on land to which a prohibited substance has been applied for a minimum of three years immediately preceding harvest of 
the crop to qualify as organic. Annual registration fees are levied by the state and, in addition, a one-time only initial registration fee is 
assessed. Fees are payable before any sales of the commodity occur and are based on projected estimates from a previous year's 
gross receipts. The state program is administered through the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). </p>
<p><b>Federal Regulations.</b> On October 1, 1993, the federal Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) became effective. This act 
sets forth production standards and regulates all organic commodities on the national level. However, due to budget and time 
constraints, final recommendations for the law's implementation have not been completed. Therefore, even though the law is now in 
place, implementation and enforcement have been delayed. Current estimates indicate that implementation and enforcement will take 
place in late 1996. Nevertheless, growers would be wise to conform to federal production standards (in addition to state regulations) 
at this time. The federal program is administered through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p>
<p>In most cases the OFPA will preempt state law except in those cases where the state applies to the USDA for approval of stricter 
standards. One difference between state and federal law is noteworthy. The federal law stipulates that growers must be certified by a 
federally accredited certifying agent on an annual basis if yearly gross sales total more than $5,000. This federal requirement should 
not be confused with, and is separate from, state registration. </p>
<p><b>Certification.</b> During the 1992-1993 time period, 45% of the registered organic farmers in California were also certified by a 
certification agency. Ninety percent of those certified were certified by California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). In addition to 
CCOF, six other organizations now actively certify growers in the state. They are: Farm Verified Organic (FVO), Oregon Tilth 
Certified Organically Grown (OTCO), the Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA), the Organic Growers and Buyers 
Association (OGBA), Quality Assurance International (QAI) and Scientific Certification Systems (SCS). Each agency must adhere 
to all state and federal laws regulating organic commodities, and in addition may enforce procedures specific to their own agencies. 
Organizations differ with respect to the certification process and the associated costs. The above organizations are registered with the 
State of California. However, none are currently accredited by the USDA since the USDA's certification program has not yet been 
implemented. Refer to the references section of this publication for additional sources of information.</p>

<h3 align=center><b>COST OF PRODUCTION </b><a name="ASSUMPTIONS"><b>ASSUMPTIONS</b></a><b> FOR ORGANIC COTTON</b></h3>
<p align=left>This study reflects the practices and costs associated with a production system for organically grown cotton in the Northern San 
Joaquin Valley. While every effort is made to model a production system based on real world practices, this report cannot fully 
represent the costs and practices that are specific to each operation or production region. Production and management techniques 
are individualized to meet the specific needs of each operation. Therefore, this study should be interpreted as a representative 
operation and not as a statistical average. Costs are represented on an annual per acre basis.</p>
<p>The farm in this report is assumed to have all acreage registered and certified as organic. To be registered and certified organic, a 
transition period is required when any farm or production unit changes from conventional practices to organically acceptable 
methods. Federal, state and certification agency rules and regulations that are specific to organic commodities must be adhered to 
during this time period if the crops are to be marketed as organic. Crops grown in transition years may not be sold or labeled as 
organic. Commodities that are produced organically can often be sold for a premium price over conventionally grown products. 
However, the supply of organic products, market competition, and consumer demand will affect grower returns.</p>
<p>The following is a description of general assumptions pertaining to sample costs for the organic cotton.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> <b><u>LAND</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>The total farm size is assumed to be 1,200 acres, 800 of which are in organic cotton production each year. Other crops grown 
organically in rotation on the 1,200 acres include alfalfa, dried beans, leguminous green manure crops (bell beans, winter peas and 
vetch), processing tomatoes, oats and wheat. Land is assumed to be level with well drained soils of moderate depth and fertility. </p>
<p><b>2. </b><b><u>RENTAL AGREEMENT</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Land is rented by the grower on an annual per acre basis. Rental costs per acre range from $125 to $325, depending on such factors 
as parcel location, soil type, water availability, and land owner's contribution to costs such as water, taxes and road maintenance. A 
per acre cost of $140 is used in this study.</p>
<p><b>3. </b><b><u>PRODUCTION PRACTICES</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Production practices for the cotton crop are listed in <a href="#Table1"><b>Table 1</b></a><b>. Costs Per Acre - Operations</b>. These tables show the order in which 
the operations are performed, as well as the hours per acre to perform each operation. Labor and custom rates, material and fuel and 
repair costs are also included in this table. Input costs can be found in <a href="#Table2"><b>Table 2</b></a><b>. Detail of Costs Per Acre - Inputs</b><b><i>. </i></b>In addition, the 
sequence of operations and the monthly cash costs per acre for the crop can be found in<a href="#Table3"> <b>Table 3</b></a><b>. Monthly Cash Costs Per Acre</b>.</p>
<p>In this report an approved Acala variety is assumed to be planted. The crop is direct seeded in April on 38-inch beds at the rate of 
15 pounds per acre. Seed cotton is custom harvested in November. </p>
<p><b>4. </b><b><u>FERTILIZING MATERIALS</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>A composted poultry manure is spread and incorporated into the soil each year prior to planting the cotton crop at the rate of six 
tons per acre. In addition, zinc sulfate is applied twice to the crop, once during September and once during October. No other 
fertilizing materials or soil amendments are used to produce the crop. </p>
<p>Cover crops are grown in rotation with revenue-producing crops on a small portion of the organic acreage each year. Cover crops 
planted in this area include winter peas and vetch. In this report, specific costs for growing a cover crop are not shown, however, 
costs can range from $50 to $120 per acre.</p>
<p><b>5. </b><b><u>CROP IRRIGATION REQUIREMENTS</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Irrigation requirements for cotton generally range from 24 to 36 acre-inches per acre per year depending on rainfall and the amount 
of water stored in the soil profile.</p>
<p>In this study the crop is assumed to be furrow irrigated by gated poly-pipe with a total of 27 acre-inches of water per acre per year 
including one preirrigation. Water is pumped from a depth of 175 feet in a 250 foot well at a cost of $4.16 per acre-inch. This figure 
is within the range of water costs for growers in the area. Because the land is rented, the land owner is assumed to be responsible for 
well and underground irrigation system maintenance and repair. Individual irrigation practices and costs will vary among locations. 
Costs for poly-pipe and poly-pipe gates are located in <a href="#Table4"><b>Table 4</b></a><b>. Whole Farm Annual Equipment, Investment, and Business 
Overhead Costs</b> under investments.</p>
<p><b>6. </b><b><u>PEST MANAGEMENT</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Disease incidence and invertebrate and vertebrate pest damage varies on a year to year basis depending on pest populations and 
management techniques. This study assumes that insect and mite populations are monitored twice weekly. In addition, larvae of the 
beneficial insect green lacewings are released 11 times during the growing season to reduce lygus bug, aphid, and mite populations. 
The application rate for green lacewings is 10,000 larvae per acre. This rate will vary depending upon the field, season and target 
pest. Sulfur dust is applied to field perimeters twice to assist with mite control. Weeds are controlled using by mechanical cultivations, 
and by hand chopping and hoeing. Refer to <a href="#Table1"><b>Table</b> <b>1</b></a><b>. Costs Per Acre - Operations</b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> </i></b><a href="#Table2"><b>Table 2</b></a><b>. Detail of Costs Per Acre - 
Inputs</b>,<b><i> </i></b>following this section for pest control measures pertinent to this study. Individual situations may vary.</p>
<p><b>7. </b><b><u>HARVEST</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Seed cotton is custom harvested in November. The custom harvest rate used in this study is calculated using a $3.25 per 
hundredweight (cwt) cost. Assuming a seed cotton yield of 2,720 pounds per acre, harvest costs equal $88.40. This rate includes the 
cost to build and tarp modules. Custom rates can range from $80 to $120 per acre depending upon whether costs are based on 
yield or on a flat per acre fee.</p>
<p>Because a custom harvest is assumed, no costs for harvest equipment are included in this study. If growers choose to perform their 
own harvesting, equipment for the required operations should be inventoried and labor, fuel, repairs and capital recovery charges 
should be added as a cost of production. Custom harvest costs, then, would not be included. <br>
</p>
<p><b>8. </b><b><u>TRANSPORTATION</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Growers within a 20-mile radius of the gin are not required to pay transportation costs from the harvest site to the gin. Therefore, no 
transportation costs are included in this study. Growers outside of the 20-mile radius must pay transportation charges which are 
based on distance between the harvest site and gin, and on module weight. As distance from the gin increases, hauling costs increase. 
Transportation costs range from approximately $7.50 to $35.00 per bale of cotton lint outside the 20-mile radius. Growers with 
modules under a minimum weight may also be required to pay a surcharge for hauling costs.</p>
<p><b>9. </b><b><u>GINNING</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>The ginning process yields two products from harvested seed cotton: lint and cottonseed. Currently, ginning costs are $3.35 per cwt 
for seed cotton. Assuming a seed cotton yield of 2,720 pounds per acre for this study, gin costs are calculated to be $91.12 per 
acre. Turnout rates are estimated to be 34% for lint and 51% for cottonseed. Costs to gin seed cotton are essentially paid for by a 
&quot;cottonseed credit&quot;, that is, the cotton gin retains the ginned cottonseed and gives growers a credit to cover ginning costs. The cost of 
ginning is not included as a line-item cost because it is deducted directly from the grower's returns by the gin. Ginning costs are only 
represented in <a href="#Table6"><b>Table 6</b></a><b>. Ranging Analysis</b>.</p>
<p>Some gins charge growers a fee to shut down and clean out the gin prior to processing organic seed cotton. In this area, no 
surcharges are stipulated, therefore, none are included in this study. </p>
<p><b>10. Y</b><b><u>IELD &amp; RETURN RANGES FOR ORGANIC COTTON</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>This study assumes a yield of 1.85 bales of cotton lint per acre, and 1,387 pounds of cottonseed per acre in <b>Tables 1-3</b>. Yields for 
organically grown cotton range from 1.3 to 2.0 (500 pound) bales of lint per acre and 1,100 to 1,500 pounds of cottonseed per 
acre. Yields will vary depending on growing conditions, soil type and fertility, irrigation practices and pest populations. </p>
<p>Price premiums for organic cotton are not guaranteed, nor are all bales necessarily sold at one set price. In this study, however, the 
price received by growers of organic cotton lint is estimated to be $1.20 per pound for all bales. With the estimated price of $1.20 
per pound for cotton lint, net returns above total costs are positive at a yield of 750 pounds lint per acre for the hypothetical farm 
analyzed in this study. At a low price of $1.00 per pound lint, the breakeven yield is 869 pounds lint per acre. At a high price of 
$1.40 per pound lint, the breakeven yield is 604 pounds lint per acre. Returns to growers range from $1.00 to $1.40 per pound lint 
with the organic premium. Refer to <a href="#Table6"><b>Table 6</b></a><b>. Ranging Analysis </b>for costs and returns at various prices and yields. </p>
<p>If a market for organic cotton lint is unavailable in any given year, the lint is sold on the conventional market without receiving a 
premium. For 1995, the preliminary price for conventional cotton is estimated to be $0.815 per pound.</p>
<p><b>11. </b><b><u>LABOR</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Basic hourly wages for workers are $6.61 and $4.83 per hour for machine operators and field workers, respectively. Adding 34% 
for workers compensation, social security, insurance and other benefits increases the labor rates shown to $8.86 per hour for 
machine labor and $6.47 per hour for non-machine labor. The labor hours for operations involving machinery are 20% higher than 
the operation times listed on <a href="#Table1"><b>Table 1</b></a> to account for extra labor involved in equipment set-up, moving, maintenance, work breaks 
and repair. Wages for managers are not included as a cash cost. Any returns above total costs are considered returns to management 
and risk.</p>
<p><b>12. </b><b><u>CASH OVERHEAD</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Cash overhead consists of various cash expenses paid out during the year that are assigned to the whole farm and not to a particular 
operation. These costs include, but are not limited to, property taxes, interest on operating capital, offices expenses, property and 
liability insurance, sanitation services and equipment repairs. </p>
<p><b>Property Taxes: </b>Counties charge a base property tax rate of 1% on the assessed value of the property. In some counties special 
assessment districts exist and additional taxes are charged on property including equipment, buildings and improvements. For this 
study, county taxes are calculated as 1% of the average value of the property. Average value equals new cost plus salvage value, 
divided by two, on a per acre basis.</p>
<p><b>Interest on Operating Capital: </b>Interest on operating capital is based on cash operating costs and is calculated monthly until 
harvest at a nominal rate of 11.61% per year. A nominal interest rate is the going market cost for borrowed funds.</p>
<p><b>Office and Business Expense:</b> Office and business expenses are estimated at $30 per acre. These expenses include, but are not 
limited to, office supplies, telephones, bookkeeping, accounting, legal fees and road maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Insurance:</b> Insurance for farm investments varies depending on the assets included and the amount of coverage. Property insurance 
provides coverage for property loss and is charged at 0.713% of the average value of the assets over their useful life. Liability 
insurance covers accidents on the farm and costs $960 per year. Cash overhead costs are found in <b>Tables </b><a href="#Table1"><b>1</b></a><b>, </b><a href="#Table2"><b>2</b></a><b>, </b><a href="#Table3"><b>3 </b></a>and <a href="#Table4"><b>4</b></a><b>. </b></p>
<p><b>Sanitation Services: </b>Sanitation services provide portable toilets for the operation and cost the farm $3,780 annually.</p>
<p><b>13. </b><b><u>NON-CASH OVERHEAD</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Non-cash overhead is calculated as the capital recovery cost for equipment and other farm investments. Although farm equipment is 
often purchased used, this study shows the current purchase price for new equipment adjusted to 60% of the new value to indicate a 
mix of new and used equipment. Annual ownership costs for equipment and other investments are shown in <b>Tables </b><a href="#Table1"><b>1</b></a><b>, </b><a href="#Table2"><b>2</b></a><b> </b>and <a href="#Table4"><b>4</b></a><b>. </b>They 
represent the capital recovery cost for each investment on an annual per acre basis.</p>
<p><b>Capital Recovery Costs: </b>Capital recovery cost is the annual depreciation and interest cost for a capital investment. In other words, 
it is the amount of money required each year to recover the difference between the purchase price and salvage value, or unrecovered 
capital. Capital recovery cost is equivalent to the annual payment on a loan for an investment with the down payment equal to the 
discounted salvage value. This is a more complex method of calculating ownership costs than by using straight-line depreciation and 
opportunity costs. However, it more accurately represents the annual costs of ownership because it takes the time value of money 
into account. The calculation for annual capital recovery costs is as follows.</p>
<p align=center>[(Purchase Price - Salvage Value) x (Capital Recovery Factor)] <br>
+ <br>
[Salvage Value x Interest Rate] </p>
<p><b>Salvage Value: </b>Salvage value is an estimate of the remaining market value of an investment at the end of its useful life. Salvage value 
is calculated differently for different investments. For farm machinery (tractors and other implements), the remaining value is a 
percentage of the new cost of the investment. Salvage value for farm equipment is calculated as follows.</p>
<p align=center>[New Price x % Remaining Value]</p>
<p>Salvage value for other investments including farm buildings, irrigation systems and miscellaneous tools and equipment is zero. The 
salvage value for land is equal to the purchase price because land does not depreciate. Purchase price and salvage value for the 
equipment and investments used in this study are shown on <a href="#Table4"><b>Table 4</b></a>. Note that salvage values for different investments vary. </p>
<p><b>Capital Recovery Factor: </b>The capital recovery factor is the amortization factor or annual payment whose present value at 
compound interest is equal to one. The capital recovery factor is a function of the interest rate and years of life of the equipment. </p>
<p><b>Interest Rate:</b> An interest rate of 3.72% is used to calculate capital recovery costs. This interest rate is the United States 
Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service's (USDA-ERS's) ten year average of the agricultural sector long-run rate of 
return to production assets from current income. It is used to reflect the long-term realized rate of return to the specialized resources 
that can only be used effectively in the agricultural sector. In other words, the next best alternative use of these resources is in another 
agricultural enterprise.</p>
<p><b>14. </b><b><u>EQUIPMENT CASH COSTS</u></b><b>:<br>
</b>Equipment costs are composed of three parts; cash overhead, non-cash overhead and operating costs. Both of the overhead factors 
are detailed in previous sections. The operating costs consist of fuel, lubrication and repairs.</p>
<p>In allocating the equipment costs on a per acre basis, the following hourly charges are calculated first and shown in <a href="#Table5"><b>Table 5</b></a>. Repair 
costs are based on the purchase price, annual hours of use, total hours of life and repair coefficients formulated by the American 
Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE). Fuel and lubrication costs are also determined by ASAE equations based on maximum 
power take-off (PTO) horsepower (hp) and the type of fuel used. The fuel and repair costs per acre for each operation in <a href="#Table1"><b>Table 1</b></a><b>.</b> 
is determined by multiplying the total hourly operating cost in <a href="#Table5"><b>Table 5</b></a><b>.</b> for each piece of equipment used for the cultural practice by 
the number of hours per acre for that operation. Tractor operation time is 10% higher than implement operation time to account for 
fueling, equipment moving and setup time. Prices for on-farm delivery of diesel and gasoline are $0.75 and $1.15 per gallon, 
respectively.</p>
<p><b>15.</b> <b><u>ASSESSMENTS</u></b>:<br>
In this study, a number of different assessment fees are included as a cost of production for organic growers. They are: </p>
<p><b>California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Organic Program: </b>A stepped scale organic grower's registration fee 
of $750 is assessed by the State of California on the gross sales amount of $888,000. The gross sales amount is calculated by 
multiplying the yield of the crop per acre (925 pounds lint) by the price received for the crop per pound ($1.20 for lint) and the 
number of planted acres for the crop (800). Income from seed is not included in assessments. This is only an estimate of potential 
fees and will vary depending on yields and returns. Contact the County Agricultural Commissioner in your area for further details.</p>
<p><b>California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF):</b> The grower is assumed to be certified by CCOF. Annual membership fees are 
$175. Inspection fees are $150. In addition, CCOF growers are also required to pay assessment fees of .5% of their gross sales. 
Total CCOF assessments for the 800 acres of cotton in this study are $4,440. Fees are based on the production amount, the number 
of acres and parcels contained in an operation as well as whether or not the farm is totally organic. Therefore, individual situations will 
vary.</p>
<p>In addition, both conventional and organic cotton growers are also assessed several fees from different organizations and for different 
purposes. They are:</p>
<p><b>National Cotton Council: </b>The National Cotton Council is a voluntary organization which collects assessments to provide lobbying, 
advocacy and public relations for the cotton industry at the national level. The current assessment is $0.45 per bale of lint.</p>
<p><b>Cotton Incorporated: </b>Cotton Incorporated was created by a federal marketing order and is overseen by the Cotton Board. Cotton 
Incorporated provides funds for industry research, promotion and marketing and currently requires growers to pay $1.00 per bale 
plus 0.5% of the lint sale price.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>USDA-HVI:</b> The USDA levies a fee for High Volume Instrumentation (HVI) classing. This determines the classification grade of 
cotton for marketing purposes. Growers are required to pay $1.55 per bale lint.</p>
<p><b>California Cotton Growers and Ginners Association (CCGGA):</b> CCGGA assists California growers and ginners in advocating 
their position in the legislature. CCGGA fees are $0.12 per bale lint. Participation is the organization is voluntary. </p>
<p><b>California Department of Food and Agriculture</b> <b>(CDFA)</b> <b>Pink Bollworm Project:</b> CDFA regulates this program, which, 
through detection and legislated postharvest practices, controls pink bollworm in the state. The Pink Bollworm Project maintains 
several control districts to administer the program. Growers are assessed fees of $2.00 per bale lint only if their cotton is ginned 
within a project district.</p>

<BR>
IN THE NORTH COAST</A><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
</H3>
<U><B>Introduction</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Recently, many wine grape growers in the North Coast region
of California have shown an interest in organic agricultural production
techniques. This interest may be influenced by concerns about
long-term soil health and crop viability and such factors as a
desire to decrease the use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.
Growers may also view organic production as a marketing tool to
appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.
<P>
This overview is meant to guide the reader through topics and
issues that are integral to organic wine grape farming. Like conventional
farming, there are numerous approaches to farming grapes organically,
from vineyard spacing and trellis design to floor management and
agricultural inputs. The following is a discussion of common practices
and issues related to organic wine grape production.
<P>
The first section of this overview describes the seasonal flow
of operations for the production of organic wine grapes. Next,
the cover crop and pest management sections give greater details
of these practices. Finally, the current status of regulations
for organically grown grapes and organic wine are discussed.
<P>
<U><B>Production Practices</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Cultural operations often begin each year after harvest with
a postharvest irrigation. Soil amendments are then applied to
vineyard soils where tissue and soil analysis, as well as grower
experience, have shown it to be appropriate. Mined limestone is
commonly applied once every third year in many North Coast vineyards.
This practice helps neutralize soil acidity (where applicable),
adds calcium to soils, improves drainage, soil tilth and the overall
availability of nutrients for crop production. Alternatively,
growers in some areas may apply gypsum to manage soil fertility
and soil nutrient levels. Gypsum adds calcium and sulfur for crop
production and can be used to improve soil tilth with soils high
in sodium. Soils deficient in phosphorus may receive applications
of rock phosphate and/or bone meal. Sulfate of potash may be banded
under the vines each year to boost and maintain potassium levels.
A compost of various materials (including manures and grape pomace)
can be spread either in vine rows and centers or vine rows only
depending upon the amount applied and the purpose of the application.
For example, growers may spread compost in vine rows and centers
to increase soil organic matter throughout the vineyard, stimulate
soil microbial activity and increase overall nutrient levels.
Alternatively, growers may choose to spread compost in vine rows
only as a means of supplying nutrients specifically for crop production.
The above operations are performed in September, October or November
depending upon when harvest occurs. Seeded cover crops are planted
and irrigated up directly after these operations. Alternatively,
if resident vegetation is used as a cover crop, then no specific
seeding operations or cover crop irrigation is performed.
<P>
Vineyard pruning takes place in December, January and February.
Vine training wires are moved downward during pruning operations
to prepare the trellis system for the new year's growth. This
is included as an operational cost for pruning. The timing of
pruning operations is critical; early pruning causes wounds to
be more susceptible to Eutypa dieback (<I>Eutypa lata</I>) if
rains should occur in December and also may expose spurs and canes
to freeze damage following a mild fall, especially in the northern
mountain areas. Prunings are thrown into the centers and shredded
and chopped with a mower/chopper. This practice is performed either
immediately after pruning or later in the season in conjunction
with spring mowing, depending on vineyard floor management practices.
<P>
A dormant spray of lime sulfur may be applied in January in some
vineyards. This practice can help decrease disease and insect
pressures from powdery mildew (<I>Uncinula necator</I>), mite
pests and overwintering insects within the vineyard. One trade-off,
however, is that lime sulfur applications usually increase mortality
rates for predaceous mites. The use of lime sulfur is therefore
not a common practice among many organic growers, but might be
used as an alternative pest control measure following years with
severe pest pressure.
<P>
Powdery mildew is controlled by multiple applications of sulfur
in the spring and summer months. In general, and depending on
management technique, a wettable sulfur is applied with an air
blast sprayer every 7 to 14 days beginning mid to late March when
growth is between budbreak and two inches. Alternatively, some
growers may choose to apply dusting sulfur with a duster during
this time. Later in the season, however, most growers will apply
dusting sulfur to vines every 7 to 14 days to speed operations,
decrease costs and increase the material's effective coverage.
Grower experience indicates that sulfur dust applications may
also increase mortality rates for predaceous mites.
<P>
Frost protection can be accomplished by either overhead sprinklers
or wind machines. When vines are irrigated with drip irrigation,
frost protection by either method represents an additional investment.
Substantial variation exists among the counties in the number
of nights per year that frost protection is necessary. The following
table lists the average frost protection requirements by overhead
sprinklers among the North Coast counties.

Hand vine care, which takes place from April through July, includes
a number of operations. Shoot thinning and suckering (removal
of water sprouts), takes place in April and May. Vine training
wires are moved three times (in April, May and June <I>or </I>May,
June and July depending on the vineyard location) to support and
accommodate vine and grape growth. Leaf removal is performed after
bloom and fruit-set to help control bunch rot (<I>Botrytis cinerea</I>)
and possibly decrease leafhopper populations.
<P>
The delivery method and the amount of water applied to vines may
vary from county to county and vineyard to vineyard. Water is
generally applied to vines from May through August. Most of the
water is applied early to mid season, with less applied closer
to harvest. Total applied water will be dependent on seasonal
rains, rooting depth, the amount of moisture stored in the soil
profile and how vineyard floor vegetation is managed. Also, soils
with increased levels of organic matter may be better able to
retain moisture and therefore decrease the amount of applied water.
<P>
Harvesting may be done by hand or by machine depending on the
vineyard design. Generally, a custom operator manages the harvest.
Depending on the county, grape variety and the yearly conditions,
harvest can take place over the period of late August through
mid November.
<P>
Yields of organically grown and conventionally produced wine grapes
are similar, and can range from approximately three to nine tons
per acre. Yields will vary depending on a number of factors including
the vineyard design, grape variety, vineyard age, county of production
and yearly growing conditions. Average yields for all grape production
are shown for the various counties in the following table.

Commodities that are produced organically can often be sold for
a higher price than conventionally grown products. However, few
pricing premiums for organic wine grapes currently exist. Therefore,
grower returns for both organic and conventional wine grapes are
usually the same, and can range from approximately $300 to $1,700
per ton depending on the grape variety and quality, county of
production and current market conditions. Average returns for
white and red varieties are shown for the various counties in

<P>
<U><B>Cover Crops</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Cover crops can be beneficial for the production of organic
wine grapes in a number of ways. If leguminous cover crops are
used, soil nitrogen may be increased through nitrogen fixation.
Water penetration and infiltration may be improved by root growth
of the cover crop and by returning organic matter to soils. Microbial
activity, often stimulated by cover crop root exudates and organic
matter additions to soils, has been shown to promote soil aggregate
stability. Microbes also enhance the decomposition process by
breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients in a form
that crops can more readily use. Increased organic matter can
also improve the soil's ability to retain moisture. Hilly North
Coast vineyards with substantial bare ground may benefit from
planting cover crops to help control erosion. Cover crops increase
the plant diversity of the vineyard and can provide nectar to
attract and sustain beneficial arthropods (insects, spiders, and
predatory mites). Cover crops can also reduce dust problems in
vineyard systems which in turn can help reduce spider mite pests.
Weed suppression may be another direct benefit of cover cropping
depending on the species or mix selected. Lastly, farm machinery
may be able to enter vineyards earlier and later in the season
in situations where a cover crop's (especially perennial cover
crops) mat of root and vegetative growth provides support on wet
soil. This may also serve to reduce soil compaction.
<P>
There may also be some disadvantages with using cover crops in
vineyards. Cover crops increase cash costs for seed and labor,
and may require the rental or purchase of additional farm machinery.
Competition between vines and cover crops may increase the need
for additional inputs such as water and nutrients. This should
be taken into consideration because water may be in short supply
in some North Coast vineyards. Some growers, however, view the
cost of planting and maintaining a cover crop as the cost of producing
nitrogen and/or improving soil quality for the long-term. Vine
row cover crops, which are sometimes used to suppress weeds in
no&#173;till systems, may provide a habitat for vertebrate pests
which can damage vines. Cover crops may also attract arthropod
pests to the vineyard. Another disadvantage of cover cropping
may be that air and soil temperatures are lowered by substantial
vegetative growth on the vineyard floor. This could increase the
possibility of frost damage. Cover crops are often closely mowed
or disced under during critical frost periods to overcome this
problem. Reduced soil and air temperatures may also delay bud
break.
<P>
Selection of a particular cover crop species should take into
account the yearly production cycle of the vine crop as well as
the climate, which dictates the planting time and winter cold
tolerance of the cover crop. Also, growers should select cover
crops for the specific needs of a vineyard. For example, if soil
nitrogen is in short supply, then a leguminous cover crop may
be preferred. If, however, increased soil organic matter is desired,
then a cover crop that includes legumes, grasses and other species
for biomass production may be the best alternative. In addition,
the soil type and the irrigation system should be taken into consideration.
Growers in some areas may find that certain cover crop species
and mixes are not suitable for their soils and conditions. Often,
the most suitable cover crop in each situation is determined by
observation and experimentation over a period of years.
<P>
In this production region several different legumes, perennial
grasses, and annual grasses are commonly planted as cover crops.
Alternatively, resident vegetation is often managed as a cover
crop. There are a number of options for managing annually sown
cover crops. If sown in the fall, the cover crop is generally
irrigated up with one to three inches of water depending on the
planting date, the amount of moisture stored in the soil profile
and seasonal rains. After this time, cover crop growth is often
dependent on fall and winter rains. In years when sufficient soil
moisture exists and/or early fall rains occur, no irrigation for
cover crop germination may be necessary. Also, vineyards without
overhead sprinkler systems generally rely on fall rains for cover
crop germination.
<P>
In the spring months management practices for annually sown cover
crops depend upon grower preference and the needs of the vineyard.
For example, some growers will mow the cover crop and incorporate
the residue by discing to reduce competition between the cover
crop and vines for water and nutrients. This practice is also
performed to speed decomposition of the vegetation and recycling
of nutrients. As an alternative after the initial cover crop mowing,
the residue may be left on the soil surface to decompose more
slowly. This practice is often preferred by those growers whose
goal is to minimize tillage operations and improve soil tilth
and structure for the long-term. Growers may then disc or mow
periodically during the summer to keep vineyard floors free of
vegetative growth, or plant a summer annual cover crop to maintain
a diverse habitat within the vineyard. Costs will vary accordingly.
<P>
Some growers may use yet another strategy for managing annually
sown cover crops. In this case, only a portion of the rows of
the cover crop are mowed initially to reduce some of the above
ground biomass. The remaining cover crop rows will continue to
provide sufficient habitat to sustain beneficial insect populations
that are already present in the vineyard. Grower experience indicates
that the number of insect pests that move to the vines may be
reduced when a portion of the cover crop remains. With regrowth
of the cover crop in the mowed rows, the remaining (unmowed) rows
are then mowed and disced. Therefore, a portion of the cover crop
will remain growing in the vineyard for a longer period of time
as an insect attractant. The disced rows may be left bare or reseeded
with a summer annual cover crop depending on the management practices
and the availability of water. Later in the season or after germination
and growth of the planted summer cover crop occur, the remainder
of the winter sown cover crop will generally be mowed and disced
under. Periodic discings may be performed in these rows during
the summer months.
<P>
Fall irrigation is generally unnecessary when resident vegetation
is managed as a cover crop. Growth of this cover crop is dependent
on moisture in the soil profile from fall and winter rains. No
tillage operations are generally performed in the spring to incorporate
vegetative growth, however resident vegetation is mowed periodically
in the spring and summer months to reduce the above ground biomass.
In the warmer summer months resident vegetation dies back; little
or no management is therefore required during this time. However,
overall vineyard irrigation requirements are increased because
of competition between the vegetation and the vine growth. Alternatively,
resident vegetation may be handled similarly to a planted cover
crop in that it is disced in the spring.
<P>
<U><B>Pest Management</B></U><B>:<BR>
</B>Most pesticides that are currently used by producers of conventionally
grown wine grapes are not approved for use by organic wine grape
growers. Sulfur is a notable exception. In general, pest control
products used by organic growers are not as effective for immediate
or acute problems as are those products used by conventional growers.
The cost for some organically acceptable pest control methods
may also be prohibitive for some growers. Therefore, vineyard
monitoring, pest identification and pest prevention are essential
elements of successful organic wine grape production.
<P>
The incidence of certain diseases such as bunch rot and powdery
mildew can be increased by moist, humid weather and spring and
fall rains. Bunch rot can often be decreased by removing leaves
around grape clusters after bloom and fruit-set to open the vine
canopy to sunlight and increase air circulation. Vineyard leaf
removal is generally performed one time only, however, in years
with increased bunch rot incidence, a second leaf removal operation
may be necessary. The incidence of powdery mildew is lessened
with sulfur applications. In spite of the potentially greater
disease incidence in organic vineyards, yields for organic wine
grapes in the North Coast are generally equal to those in conventional
culture<B>.</B>
<P>
Leafhopper and mite problems may be lessened with applications
of insecticidal soap and pyrethrin. Insecticidal soaps are derived
from plant oils or animal fats and are allowed for use by organic
growers. Pyrethrin is considered a botanical pesticide, or a pesticide
derived from a naturally occurring plant source. Therefore, it
is an acceptable method of insect control in organic farming in
California, <I>provided it does not contain the synergist piperonyl
butoxide</I>. A soap/pyrethrin mix may be applied one time only
in late spring or early summer when temperatures, and thus insect
activity, increase. However, many organic growers use pyrethrin
and/or soap on a limited basis or as an emergency pest control
measure only. For one reason, grower experience indicates that
pyrethrin use will decrease the number of predatory mites and
beneficial insects in the vineyard. The exact application rate
and the number of acres treated will depend on the vineyard location
and the extensiveness of pest infestations. Leafhopper populations
may also be lessened when leaf removal operations are performed,
as some nymphs (young leafhoppers) will be removed at the same
time. Also, coverage by the pyrethrin and/or soap spray in the
fruit zone will be greater when the vine canopy is opened. Growers
should be certain that any materials used are in compliance with
the rules and regulations of state and third party organic certification
agencies. (Refer to the <B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B>
section.)
<P>
Many beneficial arthropods, such as parasites and predators, occur
naturally within organic vineyards. When the parasitic wasp, <I>Anagrus
epos</I>, is present in vineyards, it can be helpful in controlling
the grape leafhopper (<I>Erythroneura elegantula)</I>. However,
<I>A. epos </I>requires an overwintering habitat with alternate
hosts to survive in or near vineyards on a year-round basis. Research
indicates that refuges, which can occur naturally (wild blackberries)
or are planted (prune trees), harbor alternate host leafhoppers
and may therefore attract and sustain this parasitic wasp during
the winter. When these plants are growing in or near the vineyard,
parasite activity will usually be higher earlier in the spring.
It should be noted that blackberries and other plant species growing
in neighboring riparian areas can also serve as a host to sharpshooter
leafhoppers, which are vectors of Pierce's Disease. Predaceous
arthropods such as spiders, lacewings, and lady beetles can also
lessen overall insect pest damage within the vineyard and should
therefore be encouraged to proliferate by providing an appropriate
habitat (cover crops) and avoiding insect and dormant sprays whenever
possible.
<P>
Vineyard weeds are most often controlled by discing or mowing
centers and by cultivation with a French plow (or a comparable
implement) in the vine rows. Hand weeding is often used in addition
to mechanical cultivations as a means of vine row weed control.
The number of mechanical cultivations, mowings and/or hand weedings
may vary among growers. Therefore, production costs may also vary.
Some growers are currently using or experimenting with flame weed
control in the vine rows. Weeds are not actually burned back;
the plant's cells burst upon exposure to the high temperatures
a flame weeder produces. This practice essentially kills and eliminates
the targeted plants. A few growers are also testing the &quot;mow
and move&quot; approach, where cover crop clippings are deposited
under the vine row to suppress weed growth.
<P>
<U><B>Regulations of Organically Grown Commodities</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>As of January 1, 1992 all growers of organic commodities must
register on a yearly basis with the State of California under
the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, AB 2012. Enforced under
this act are the provisions of Article 4.5 (commencing with Section
26569.20) of Chapter 5 of Division 21 of the California Health
and Safety Code. These provisions contain rules and regulations
which must be adhered to by all producers and handlers of organic
commodities. State law requires that growers follow the necessary
guidelines for at least 12 months prior to becoming organic. State
registration fees are levied based on the previous year's gross
sales. Fees are payable before any sales of the commodity occur.
<P>
In addition to state registration, some growers may choose to
be certified by a third party certification agency. Third party
agencies were formed to set forth and monitor standards for organic
production. Before state laws began to govern organic commodities,
third party agencies were often the only means to verify that
products were, in fact, organically grown. Third party organizations
must adhere to all state laws regulating organic commodities,
and in addition may enforce standards and procedures specific
to their own agencies. Differences between organizations may also
occur in the certification process and the associated costs. Farm
advisors in your area of interest may be able to provide additional
information or assistance.
<P>
California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) is one of a number
of third party organizations in the United States which can certify
organic growers within the State of California. CCOF adheres to
the standards of the California Organic Foods Act of 1990 as well
as its own procedures and standards. Certification by CCOF is
voluntary. CCOF currently requires a three year transition period
when converting from conventional production practices to organically
acceptable methods.
<P>
On October 1, 1993, the federal Organic Foods Production Act of
1990 was to become effective. However, due to budget constraints,
implementation of the law will be delayed for at least one year.
When implemented, the act will regulate all organic commodities
on the national level and will preempt state law where state law
is less stringent than federal law. The Secretary of Agriculture
has appointed a National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to make
recommendations for implementing the law, including the compilation
of a national materials list. This list will indicate which agricultural
materials are permissible and which are prohibited in organic
agriculture on the national level. The original directive of the
Organic Foods Production Act stated that organic growers did not
need to register on the federal level. Growers were, however,
to be certified by a third party certification agency or a state
agency. This requirement was to be different from, and in addition
to, California state registration. Because of budget cuts and
implementation changes, organic grower's registration requirements
may be different than the original directive when the law is finally
enacted. Therefore, organic growers and other interested parties
should use this information as a guideline only. To comply with
the federal law in its current form, growers making the change
from conventional to organic must complete a three year transitional
period. This means that growers within California must already
be in transition to be certified organic on the federal level
by the law's anticipated implementation in 1994.
<P>
<U><B>Organic Production Versus Organic Processing</B></U>:<BR>
California has seen a substantial increase in acreage dedicated
to the production of organic wine grapes in the last two years.
In 1990 CCOF reported that wine grape acreage certified organic
or pending certification totaled 5,816 acres. By 1991 this figure
had increased to 10,120. Because this figure does not necessarily
include all state registered growers, it may represent only a
portion of the total organic acreage. However, it is the only
data currently available.
<P>
California currently follows the standards and guidelines of the
Organic Foods Act of 1990 to regulate processed organic products,
including organic wine. At issue in the winemaking process is
the matter of naturally occurring versus added sulfites. Sulfites
are naturally produced at extremely low levels during the wine
fermentation process (generally 10 parts per millions (ppm) or
less). Also, sulfites are normally added during wine processing
to decrease the risk of oxidation and microbial spoilage. Under
the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, sulfite additives are
prohibited. Therefore, wines with added sulfites may not be labeled
organic by California state law regardless of whether or not the
wine grapes used in processing were organically grown. However,
these wines may claim to be processed from organically grown wine
grapes. When no sulfites are added, but do occur naturally, wines
may be labeled organic under California state law provided all
regulations governing organic commodities are adhered to and that
100% organically grown wine grapes are used. Organic wines currently
represent only a very small segment of the market.
<P>
In addition to state rules and regulations, the United States
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF) mandates that
any wine that contains greater than 10 ppm sulfites be labeled
as a product that contains sulfites. The maximum level of sulfites
currently allowed in any wine by the BATF is 350 ppm.
<P>
An organization of wine grape growers, winemakers, distributors,
and wholesalers, the Organic Grapes Into Wine Alliance, is currently
addressing the issue of organic wine standards on the federal
level with the NOSB. The alliance would like to develop a standard
definition of organic wine, and to develop minimum standards by
which organic wines can be processed, including the limitation
and regulation of sulfites. Federal standards for processed organic
foods and wines are targeted for enactment in late 1994. It is
not yet clear how this will ultimately affect California legislation
governing organic wines. However, the alliance hopes that eventually
standards will be initiated on both state and federal levels which
are in alignment with international regulations, thus enabling
trade throughout the United States and the world.<BR>

In The North Coast<BR>
</A><I>With An Annually Sown Cover Crop</I> </CENTER></H2>

<P>
This study reflects the practices and costs associated with a
production system for organically grown wine grapes in the North
Coast region of California. While every effort is made to model
a production system based on real world practices, this report
cannot fully represent the costs and practices that are specific
to each vineyard, or the variations that exist between the four
counties which comprise this region. Therefore, this study should
be interpreted as a representative operation and not as a statistical
average.
<P>
The vineyard in this report is assumed to have been established
as a conventional vineyard for wine grape production. It is considered
to have completed the transition period and is registered and
certified as organic. Changing a farming system from conventional
to organic practices requires a transition period. State and third
party certification agency rules and regulations which are specific
to organic commodities must be adhered to during this time period.
Crops grown in transition years may not be sold or labeled as
organic. Commodities that are produced organically can often be
sold for a higher price than conventionally grown products. However,
few pricing premiums for organic wine grapes currently exist.
<P>
The following is a description of general assumptions pertaining
to sample costs for organic wine grape production with an annually
sown cover crop in the North Coast region. The costs are based
on common practices used by local growers and may not be applicable
to all situations. Production practices and vineyard management
techniques are generally individualized to meet the specific needs
of each grower. These costs are represented on an annual per acre
basis.
<P>
<B>1. <U>LAND</U>:<BR>
</B>The total vineyard size is 37 acres. Land is owned by the
grower and is valued at $13,000 per acre. This figure is within
the low and high ranges of values for undeveloped land with vineyard
potential for the four counties that comprise this region. Land
costs per acre will vary within the region and within each county.
Land is not depreciated.<B> </B>Land is assumed to be level, with
well drained soils of moderate depth and fertility. The following
table shows the range of values for land suitable for vineyards
in each county.<BR>

<B>2. <U>VINEYARD ESTABLISHMENT</U></B>: <BR>
The establishment cost is the sum of the costs for the land preparation,
trellis system, planting, vines, cash overhead and production
expenses for growing the vines through the first year that grapes
are harvested (year three). The vineyard establishment cost is
used to determine the non-cash overhead expenses, depreciation
and interest on investment during the production years. (For more
detailed information on this cost refer to the companion study
<I><B>Sample Costs To Establish A Vineyard And Produce Wine Grapes
In Sonoma County - 1992</B></I>).
<P>
<B>3. <U>VINES</U>:<BR>
</B>Grape variety is not specified in this study. Vines are planted
on a 7' x 11' spacing with 566 vines per acre. Vines are cordon
trained and spur pruned. The vineyard life is assumed to be 22
years beyond three establishment years.
<P>
<B>4. <U>TRELLIS SYSTEM</U>:<BR>
</B>A vertical shoot positioned trellis is utilized with a five
wire design; a lower, or fruiting wire, and two pair of movable
wires above. Wires are attached to lodgepoles which are placed
at every fourth vine. The drip irrigation line is attached to
the permanent (lower) wire. The movable wires are adjusted three
times (May, June and July) during the growing season to accommodate
vine and grape growth.
<P>
<B>5. <U>DRIP IRRIGATION</U>:<BR>
</B>Water for the drip irrigation system is pumped from a depth
of 150 feet in a 200 foot well using a 10 horsepower (hp) pump.
Pressure at the discharge head is 35 pounds per square inch (psi)
and produces a flow of 125 gallons per minute (gpm). The cost
for the drip irrigation system includes the 10 hp pump, the filtration
system, all drip lines, emitters and labor charges for installation.
In addition, 100% of the cost to refurbish the well is included
in the cost of the drip irrigation system. The irrigation system
has a 25 year lifespan, is an improvement to the property, and
is therefore included in <A HREF="#table4" ><B>Table 4 </B></A>as
an investment.
<P>
The amount of drip irrigation water applied for crop growth is
assumed to be 200 gallons per vine per year or approximately one-third
of an acre-foot per acre. The amount of water applied through
the drip system to irrigate the vines relates to the vineyard
floor management practices. Incorporation of a cover crop in the
spring minimizes the competition for soil moisture between the
cover crop and vines. (See the <B>cover crop</B> section below).
The pumping cost for irrigation water is estimated at $24.48 per
acre-foot. This vineyard is irrigated with the drip system between
May and August.
<P>
<B>6. <U>OVERHEAD SPRINKLERS/FROST PROTECTION</U>: <BR>
</B>In this study, an overhead sprinkler system is used mainly
for frost protection, but is also used for postharvest irrigation
and for cover crop germination. The entire system consists of
a 20 acre-foot reservoir, a 1500 gpm pump powered by a diesel
engine, a permanent underground pipeline, and solid set sprinklers.
Water for the indicated operation is pumped from the well into
the reservoir and stored there until needed. This system has an
expected 25 year life, is considered an improvement to the property,
and is therefore included as an investment in <A HREF="#table4" ><B>Table 4 </B></A><B>.</B>
<P>
Three inches of water per acre is applied for the postharvest
irrigation and one inch per acre for cover crop germination. Frost
protection is assumed to be necessary 12 nights per year at six
hours per night. Each frost protection application is equal to
approximately one-half inch of water per night per acre. Frost
protection takes place over the period from March through May.
Annual water application through this system on all 37 acres is
19.79 acre-feet total for the postharvest irrigation, cover crop
germination and frost protection. The cost of the water for overhead
sprinkler operations is $52.08 per acre-foot. The cost difference
between water for drip irrigation and for sprinklers is due to
the extra pumping required to move the water from the reservoir
through the overhead sprinklers. These figures are within a range
of use and costs for the North Coast and will vary among the counties.
<P>
<B>7.</B> <U><B>YIELD &amp; RETURN RANGES FOR ORGANIC WINE GRAPES</B></U><B>:
<BR>
</B>For the hypothetical vineyard in this study no pricing premium
is assumed. Net returns above total costs are positive at a price
for grapes of $1,000 per ton when yields reach 4.75 tons per acre.
For prices at or below $500 per ton and for yields at or below
9 tons per acre, it is not profitable to produce organic wine
grapes. At a high price of $1,700 per ton, the breakeven yield
is 2.4 tons per acre. A ranging analysis for varying yields and
prices is shown in <A HREF="#table6" ><B>Table 6</B>.</A>
<P>
<B>8. <U>PRODUCTION PRACTICES</U>: <BR>
</B>Production practices in this study are listed in <A HREF="#table1" ><B>Table 1</B></A>.
This table shows the order in which the operations are performed,
as well as the hours per acre required for each operation. Labor
and custom rates, material and fuel and repair costs are also
included in this table. In addition, <A HREF="#table3" ><B>Table 3 </B></A>shows
the monthly cash costs and sequence of operations.
<P>
To increase soil tilth, fertility, and nutrient availability,
some soil amendments are applied to the organic vineyard analyzed
in this study, as shown in the following table. Soil amendments
are added if warranted by appropriate tissue and soil sampling.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Chart not available<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</B></I><B>9. <U>COVER CROPS</U>:<BR>
</B>In this study, a winter annual cover crop is sown each year
in the fall. The planted cover crop is a mixture of oats, winter
peas, and purple vetch. To prepare the ground for seeding of the
cover crop, vineyard row centers are disced once in the fall after
harvest. The seed mixture is then drilled into the centers only,
at a rate of 52.5 pounds per planted acre. This represents 75%
of the seeding rate per vineyard acre to account for space taken
up by the vine rows. This seeding rate also represents a mixture
of the three species of cover crops (18.75 pounds of oats, 19.5
pounds of winter peas and 14.25 pounds of vetch). The cover crop
is sprinkler irrigated with one inch of water for germination.
After this irrigation, cover crop growth is dependent on moisture
in the soil profile and fall and winter rains. When brush from
the pruning operations is chopped in March the cover crop is mowed
simultaneously. In April, the cover crop is mowed again, and then
incorporated into the soil by discing. Throughout the remainder
of the spring and summer row centers are disced to control weeds.
Therefore, no irrigation water is necessary in the late spring
or summer months for the cover crop.
<P>
<B>10. <U>PEST MANAGEMENT</U>:<BR>
</B>The incidence of disease, as well as invertebrate and vertebrate
pest damage is assumed to be low. However, some treatments are
commonly used to minimize pest damage. The following table indicates
the pest management techniques used in this study.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Chart not available</B></I> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
Because many beneficial arthropods occur naturally within organic
vineyards, costs for release or augmentation of parasites and
predators are not considered in this study. Weeds in the vineyard
centers are controlled by discing. A French plow is used to cultivate
vine row weeds. Hand weeding is used in the vine rows in addition
to mechanical cultivations. No other means of weed control are
used in this report.
<P>
<B>11. <U>HARVEST</U>:<BR>
</B>Harvest operations are performed by a custom operator at a
cost of $120 per ton. This rate reflects the cost for hand harvesting.
This study assumes that harvest takes place in the month of September.
<P>
For more information on custom harvesting contact the farm advisor
or companies contracting for grapes in the area of interest. If
growers choose to do their own harvesting, equipment for the required
operations should be inventoried and labor, fuel, repairs, depreciation
and interest on investment should be added as a cost of production
to <B>Tables <A HREF="#table2" ><B>1</B></A> </B>and <A HREF="#table3" ><B>3</B></A>.
Custom charges, then, would not be included.
<P>
<B>12. <U>LABOR</U>:<BR>
</B>Basic hourly wages for workers are $8.00 and $6.00 per hour
for machine operators and field workers, respectively. Adding
34% for SDI, FICA, insurance and other benefits increases the
labor rates shown to $10.72 per hour for machine labor and $8.04
per hour for non-machine labor. The labor hours for operations
involving machinery are 20% higher than operation time to account
for extra labor involved in equipment set-up, moving, maintenance
and repair. Wages for managers are not included as a cash cost.
Any returns above total costs are considered returns to management
and risk.
<P>
<B>13. <U>INVESTMENT</U>:<BR>
</B>The investments shown in <A HREF="#table4" ><B>Table 4</B> </A>are
those that are allocated to the entire vineyard. The totals in
<A HREF="#table4" ><B>Table 4</B> </A>are used for the costs in
<B>Tables <A HREF="#table2" ><B>2</B></A>, <A HREF="#table4" ><B>4</B></A>
</B>and<B> <A HREF="#table6" ><B>6</B></A>. </B>Annual investments
shown in <A HREF="#table1" ><B>Table 1</B> </A>represent depreciation
and opportunity cost for each investment on an annual per acre
basis.
<P>
<B>14. <U>BUSINESS OVERHEAD</U></B>: <BR>
County taxes are calculated as 1% of the average value of equipment,
buildings and improvements. Property insurance is charged at 0.5%
of the average value of all assets over their useful life. Liability
insurance covers accidents on the farm and costs $300 per year.
Office and business costs are estimated at $250 per acre for the
farm. These expenses include office supplies, telephones, bookkeeping,
accounting, legal fees, road preparation and maintenance. Leaf
and soil analyses are included at $4 per acre.
<P>
<B>15. <U>ASSESSMENTS</U>:<BR>
</B>In this study, a stepped scale organic grower's registration
fee of $300 is assessed by the State of California on the gross
sales amount of $175,750. The fee is calculated by multiplying
the yield (4.75 tons per acre) by the price received ($1,000 per
ton) and the number of acres (37). This is only an estimate of
potential fees and will vary depending on yields and returns.
Contact the County Agricultural Commissioner in your area for
further details.
<P>
The grower is assumed to be certified by California Certified
Organic Farmers (CCOF). CCOF adheres to the standards of the California
Organic Foods Act of 1990 as well as its own specific procedures
and standards. Certification by CCOF is voluntary. Before January
1, 1992, CCOF required a one year transition period when converting
from conventional production practices to organically acceptable
methods. The requirement is now three years. Annual membership
fees are $125. Inspection fees are $115. An assessment fee of
0.5% of gross sales, or $879, is included as a cost of production.
These fees are specific to this study. Fees are based on the number
of acres and parcels contained in an operation as well as whether
or not the farm is totally organic. Therefore, individual situations
may vary.
<P>
<B>16. <U>INTEREST</U>:<BR>
</B>Interest on operating capital is based on a short term interest
rate charged against cash costs and is calculated monthly until
harvest at a nominal interest rate of 9% per year. Interest is
also charged on investment at a real interest rate of 4% per year
to account for income foregone that could be received from an
alternative investment (opportunity cost) and is calculated using
a long term interest rate charged on the average value of the
land, improvements to the property and equipment. A real interest
rate indicates the return for the use of capital and does not
include any adjustment for inflation. A nominal interest rate
would include an inflation factor.
<P>
<B>17. <U>EQUIPMENT COSTS</U>:<BR>
</B>In allocating the equipment costs per acre, the following
calculations were made and shown in <A HREF="#table5" ><B>Table 5</B></A>:
(a) <B>Original Cost</B> of equipment is the cost of the new equipment
plus sales tax. (b) <B>Depreciation</B> is straight line with
a 10% salvage value. (c) <B>Interest</B> on investment is calculated
as the average value per acre of the equipment during its useful
life multiplied by a real interest rate of 4%. Average value per
acre equals new cost plus salvage value divided by 2 then divided
by the number of acres. (d) The <B>Total Investment Costs</B>
are calculated as 60% of the depreciation and the interest costs
for all new equipment to reflect a mix of the new and used equipment.
These values are also used in <B>Table <A HREF="#table1" ><B>1</B></A>,
<A HREF="#table4" ><B>4</B></A>, and <A HREF="#table6" ><B>6</B></A>.
All of this equipment is used on the entire 37 acre vineyard.</B>
<P>
<B>18. <U>FUEL &amp; REPAIR</U>: <BR>
</B>The fuel and repair cost per acre for each operation in <A HREF="#table1" ><B>Table 1 </B></A>is
determined by multiplying the total hourly operating cost for
each piece of equipment <A HREF="#table5" >in <B>Table 5</B> </A>by
the number of hours per acre for that operation. Prices for on-farm
delivery of gasoline and diesel are $0.98 and $0.71 per gallon,
respectively.
